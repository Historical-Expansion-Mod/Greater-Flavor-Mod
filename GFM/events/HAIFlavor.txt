# The Twin Republics at the event is more about the 1871 friendship treaty an plans to reunite with the concent of both sentates (never happened duh), however the plan had existed as far back the 1840s with negotiations between the Trinitarios and Liberals/Boyeristes. But the 1871 treaty was more of a US style federation of only 2 countries, with a united army, a federal congress, senate, president, currency, and universial citizenship for both sides and free movement, but had each 'republic' with a their own guards, laws and sentate. The National Party of Haiti heavily opposed it largely as they feared it would bias the Liberal Party and their Blue Party Compatriots in the Dominican Republic as they themselves generaly disliked the their right wing populist compatriots in the DR. Dominican Blues maintain separation most out of promoting nationalism however still primarly avoided it out of understandably not wanting anything to do with Haitian debts to France which at the time Haitians were paying 40% their income to France and US banks.

#Commented out until more depth is added--randomly switching governments without warning isn't very well designed. Rather than there being just one event in which Haiti either becomes radical or doesn't and things just turn out however they turn out, there should be at least one event in advance which informs the player of the circumstances and the situation leading up to the coup, then an event about the coup itself and a way for Salnave to either stay in power or lose it as it occurred historically.
#Sylvain Salnave's Presidency, historical defeat or victory (historically Salnave was opposed the Haitian bourgeois as traitors to the goals of the Haitian revolution, couped Geffard, stopped wealth elections for more Jacobin-esque popular commitees, seized property making them state or workers ran, with also plans to end payments to the French. However he still did this through a coup declaring himself dictator for life with non-presidential elections and his planned militarization for war against the Spanish to Liberate Cuba backfired allowing a bourgeois, and despite mobilizing a large segment of the Haitian workers, women and peasants the firepower as just too great and destruction of the Presidential Palace, afterward thinking he had allies in the DR due to his fight in the restoration war against the spanish they Dominican Liberals would turn him into the Haitian Liberals where he was executed.)  # He could also be a radical due to his militant plans to use the Haitian military from plans to support John Brown, or supporting the Union against the CSA, wanting to push the Spain out of the DR and reunite or outright expell the Spanish from Cuba and Puerto Rico to form an Antillean union as suggested by Madiou or his ally in Puerto Rico, Betances - though his policies seemingly were genuinely more socialist then what more Jacobins put forward.
