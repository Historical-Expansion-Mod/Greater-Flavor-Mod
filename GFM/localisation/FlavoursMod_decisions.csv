The country's economic and strategic strength was buttressed by the fleet, localized military action was a staple of the not-entirely-peaceful 'Pax Britannica'. In addition, the threat of naval force was a significant factor in diplomacy.\nDuring the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive. The sea routes to the colonies, especially those linking Britain to India were vital.\n§RNOTE: This will cause Britain to reject all alliances with great powers unless it is threatened by another rising great power or Belgium gets annexed.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

singapore_strategy_title;The Singapore Strategy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
singapore_strategy_desc;The Singapore strategy was a naval defense policy of the British Empire that evolved in a series of war plans from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base; Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base; work continued on this naval base and its defenses over the next two decades. The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms.;;;;;;;;;;;

The port was primarily used as a summer anchorage for the Royal Navy's China Station and it was also used as a health resort.

Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.

abolish_slavery_romania_desc;The earliest law which freed a category of slaves was in March 1843 in Wallachia, which transferred the control of the state slaves owned by the prison authority to the local authorities, leading to their sedentarizing and becoming peasants. A year later, in 1844, Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. \n\nIn 1847, in Wallachia, a law of Prince Gheorghe Bibescu adopted by the Divan freed the slaves owned by the church and the rest of the slaves owned by the state institutions.\n\nIn Moldavia, in December 1855, following a proposal by Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, a bill drafted by Mihail Kogalniceanu and Petre Mavrogheni was adopted by the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (that is, citizens). In Wallachia, only two months later, in February 1856, a similar law was adopted by the National Assembly, paying a compensation of 10 galbeni for each slave, in stages over a number of years. The freed slaves had to settle to a town or village and stay there for at least two censuses and they would pay their taxes to the compensation fund.;;;;;;;;;;;;

abolish_the_imperial_examinations_title;Abolish the Imperial Examinations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
abolish_the_imperial_examinations_desc;Already in 1738, the war minister wrote to the Qianlong Emperor that the imperial selection system was ineffective, but since nobody had a better alternative at the time, it was kept up to the present day. The system functions via a series of increasingly complex exams meant to sift out especially competent administrators from the populace. Once they pass the final, most difficult tests, they become government officials. The most-criticized problems of this system are that the ability to study for and pass exams does not necessarily equate to skill in administration. Many who pass are good at studying but aren't truly talented at administering or working together with others. Another flaw is the widespread corruption allowing people to pass the exams by just bribing the supervisors. The proposed replacement is called the 'foreign imperial examination system', allowing only those who have studied abroad for at least 3 years to partake in exams that emphasize foreign languages and sciences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These were converted from hereditary governors to appointed governmental posts, as had been done by Chinese Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era rulers in first recognizing Tusi (tribal leaders) as imperial officials, then replacing them with imperial appointees. The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and mueang developed into provinces. \n\nResistance to these reforms would cause uprisings by traditional local leaders around the Kingdom for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was committed to expanding French control over the middle Niger River valley, but unlike many of his predecessors, he was more willing to sanction (or accept) direct conquest of territory.

Sir George Goldie argued for the amalgamation of the British firms operating in Niger river region into a single monopolistic chartered company, a method contemporaries supposed had been buried with the ultimate failure of the East India Company following the Sepoy Rebellion. Soon, he successfully merged all British firms into a single United African Company, he then acted as the combined firm's agent in the territory.\n\nGoldie first began addressing the administration's concerns by increasing the company's capitalization to 100,000¤, He then managed to corral 1,000,000¤in investments in a new concernthe National African Company. Goldie's cash-flush NAC was then able to maintain 30 trading posts along the river and buy out opposing interests in the region and eventually, he was able to crow that it "remained alone in undisputed commercial possession of the NigerBinué region".;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was formerly known as Kita Ezo, meaning Northern Ezo (Ezo was the former name for Hokkaido).\n\nJapanese settlement on Sakhalin dates to at least the Edo period. Otomari was established in 1679, and cartographers of the Matsumae domain mapped the island, and named it "Kita-Ezo". Japanese cartographer and explorer Mamiya Rinzo established that Sakhalin was an island through his discovery of what is now named Mamiya Strait (Strait of Tartary) in 1809. Japan unilaterally proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island in 1845, but its claims were not recognized by the Russian Empire.\n\nKarafuto shall be officially designated an external territory of $COUNTRY$, and its administration and development came under the aegis of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs..;;;;;;;;;;;;;

jules_ferry_laws_title;The Jules Ferry Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jules_ferry_laws_desc;French education during the 19th century was marked by two distinct and segregated systems, the first being a secondary school system and the second a primary school system. However, in each of these systems, the Catholic Church provided an alternative to secular schooling that was often the only option for families in economically depressed regions of France. \n\nThe Jules Ferry Laws were a set of French Laws which established free education, then mandatory and laic (secular) education. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, was widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (l'école républicaine). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader anti-clerical campaign in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Over the course of the 19th century this involvement gradually increased. The colonial government was, in particular, interested in fostering trade as this provided it with its main source of revenue, in the form of customs duties and other taxes. This inevitably drew it into engagement with the African kingdoms, mainly by making treaties with the kingdoms or sending military expeditions against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;

reforms_of_abdulmejid_i_desc;Sultan Abdulmejid I enjoyed several years of peace, which enabled him to form a powerful and well disciplined army that was established at the beginning of the year $YEAR$.\n\nThe chain-of-command in the general staff of each army was composed of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery. In each corps there were three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. \n\nThe total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire.

In addition, a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898. The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education: many professional schools were established, including Law School, School of Arts, School of Trades, Civil Engineering School, The Veterinarian School, The Customs School, The Farming School, The Linguistic School, and more.\n\nAbdul Hamid II attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohlcr and, finally, Colmar Von der Goltz as military advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OTTOMAN_NATIONAL_ANTHEMN_TITLE;The Imperial Anthem of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OTTOMAN_NATIONAL_ANTHEMN_DESC;The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the Mahmudiye Marsi.\n\nLike in many other monarchies of its time, the anthem of the Ottoman Empire was an imperial anthem, not a national one. Hence it paid homage to a specific ruler and a new anthem was composed at each imperial succession. However, in $YEAR$, with the Tanzimat reforms, the Mecidiye Marsi was recognized as the first official Ottoman national anthem.

Of particularly significant were two provisions: first, "the Persian Government abandons all claims to the city and province of Sulaimania" and, second, "the Ottoman Government formally recognizes the sovereignty of Persia over Muhammara, Khizr, Abaddan, and the land on the eastern bank that is to say, the left bank of the Shatt Al-Arab, which are in the possession of the tribes, recognized as belonging to Persia.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
