173164OPTA;No Surrender, let the Colombians come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
173164OPTB;We stand no chance, cede the area, immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME123676;Costa Rica seizes Bocas Del Toro;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123676;\n\nCosta Rica fearing both our own and English expansion into Bocas Del Toro have sent a flimsy expedition to claim the area as their own, this is simply unacceptable and unjustified we must immediately send our own expedition into the area to kick them out, and if they refuse threaten them with war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
173163OPTA;Outfit the expedition immediately, and send the ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
173163OPTB;It is their land, fair and square.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
