The miasma from the effluent is thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera before the Great Stink are blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.

bon_compagni_law_desc;The Bon-Compagni Law, named after the Minister of Education Carlo Boncompagni of Mombello, establishes national boarding schools, which constitute the backbone of the new Piedmontese school system. The law provides for governmental control of schools of all levels, both state and free, through the Superior Council of Education, which is responsible for the organization of studies, teaching plans, the approval of course programs and books and treaties adopted. The law also eliminates the bishop's authorization for the appointment of professors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC124618;The borders between French Guiana and Brazil are not clear. Past attempts at negotiations have failed, and in 1862 it was decided that the area between the Amazon and the Oyapock was a neutral territory. Paul Quartier who had previously visited the territory in 1883, returned in 1885 and had a meeting with the village chiefs of Counani and Carsewenne who are hostile to the Brazilians.

OHNOWEWANTMORESHOEPAY;The Panic of 1857 has resulted in the temporary loss of jobs for many shoemakers. Workers are also angry at the increasing mechanization of the shoemaking process. Since companies began hiring again, the cost of shoes has gone up and wages have declined significantly. Hours are long (16 hours of work per day) and wages are low; men are earning only $3 a week and women just $1. In early 1860, the Mechanics Association formed and demanded higher wages. The company owners refused to meet with committees of the association and workers have decided to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DAGUERROTYPELOC;Invented by Louis Daguerre and introduced worldwide in 1839, the daguerreotype is the first publically available photographic recording method. To make the image, a daguerreotypist polished a sheet of silver-plated copper to a mirror finish, treated it with fumes that made its surface light sensitive, exposed it in a camera for as long as was judged to be necessary, which could be a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or longer with less intense lighting, made the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor, removed its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment, rinsed and dried it, and then sealed the easily marred result behind glass in a protective enclosure. The image is on a mirror-like silver surface and will appear either positive or negative, depending on the viewing angle, lighting and reflectiveness and brightness of the background reflected in the metal. The darkest areas of the image are simply bare silver, lighter areas have a fine texture. The surface is very delicate, and even the lightest wiping can permanently scuff it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
panic_of_eighteenthirtyseven;The Panic of 1837;;;;;;;;;;;;;
panic_of_eighteenthirtyseven_desc;The Panic of 1837 is a financial crisis in the United States that has touched off a major depression, which will last until the mid-1840s. Profits, prices, and wages went down; unemployment are going up; and pessimism abounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANICOFEIGHTEENTHIRTYSEVENLOC;The panic had both domestic and foreign origins. Speculative lending practices in the West, a sharp decline in cotton prices, a collapsing land bubble, international specie flows, and restrictive lending policies in Britain were all factors. The lack of a central bank to regulate fiscal matters, which President Jackson had ensured by not extending the charter of the Second Bank of the United States, was also key. This ailing economy of early 1837 led investors to panic, a bank run ensued, giving the crisis its name. The run came to a head on May 10, 1837, when banks in New York City ran out of gold and silver. A significant economic collapse followed. Despite a brief recovery in 1838, the recession persisted for about seven years. Nearly half of all banks failed, businesses closed, prices declined, and there was mass unemployment. From 1837 to 1844 deflation in wages and prices was widespread. The lack of deposit insurance deepened the Panic. By 1850 the economy was booming again, a result of increased specie flows from the California Gold Rush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HUNZALOC;When Mortimer Durand, Secretary for State of India was appointed administrator of the Gilgit Agency, he opened up the region by building roads, telegraph and mail systems. He intended to improve the road from Kashmir through Hunza and Nagar and up to the frontier with Russia. The Mirs of Nagar and Hunza saw this as a threat to their natural advantage of remoteness. In 1890, Durand reinforced Chalt Fort that was near the border due to the rumor that Nagar and Hunza fighters were about to attack it, building up the road up to the fort. In May 1891, Nagar and Hunza sent a warning to Durand not to continue work on the road to the fort and to vacate the fort on the Gilgit side of the border, else they would regard it as an act of war. Durand reinforced the fort and accelerated the road construction to it, causing Nagar and Hunza to break relations. Britain regarded this as a breach of their 1889 agreement with Hunza, and after an ultimatum was issued and ignored they initiated the Hunza-Nagar Campaign of $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GILDEDLOC;The Gilded Age is an era occurring during the late 19th century, from the 1870s to about 1900. It is a time of rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern and Western United States. As American wages soar above those in Europe, especially for skilled workers, we are is seeing an influx of millions of immigrants. The rapid expansion of industrialization is leading to a real wage growth of 60% between 1860 and 1890 and spreading across the growing labor force. The average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) will rise 48% between 1880 and 1890. Conversely, the Gilded Age is also an era of abject poverty and inequality, as millions of immigrants pour into the United States, and the high concentration of wealth becomes more visible and contentious. Politically, the gilded age is introducing more and more influence of business, with tycoons such as John D. Rockefeller, Andrew W. Mellon, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan, Meyer Guggenheim and Cornelius Vanderbilt, so-called 'robber barrons' lobbying congress to follow their will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While a number of the birds were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FWTHREEDEATHLOC;Born in 1770 and crowned King of Prussia and Margrave of Brandenburg in 1797, Frederick William III died of a fever today at the age of 69. His steady and confident rule saw Prussia through the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire. He was seen as a homely and down-to-earth ruler due to his purely love-motivated marriage to Luise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a member of the low nobility. Under his leadership, Prussia progressed from an absolutist, agrarian caste society to an enlightened and industrial nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FWFOURDEATHLOC;Born in 1795 and crowned King of Prussia in 1840, Frederick William IV passed away today at the age of 65 due to a stroke. He had already suffered several strokes in 1857 that slurred his speech, signing the official regency of his brother William I and effectively resigning from power. Another stroke in 1859 paralyzed his left side, and a further one permanently robbed him of consciousness in Novemeber of 1860. His last stroke ended the suffering. His legacy includes his handling of the revolutions of 1848 and the many castles and monuments he had constructed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WILONEDEATHLOC;Born in 1797 and crowned King of Prussia in 1860 having held the regency for the incapacitated Frederick William IV since 1858, Wilhelm I left us today at the age of 90 after a short period of illness. His last words were 'Ich habe keine Zeit müde zu sein.' or 'I have no time to be tired.'. A man of great vigor and tenacity even in his high age, he survived 4 assassination attempts, one only because of the protection of his Pickelhaube. Deeply loved by the people for his dignity, friendliness and compassion, he will have the most memorials of any German monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FTHREEDEATHLOC;Born in 1831 and crowned King of Prussia in 1888, Frederick II only wore the crown for 99 days. A strong smoker, he had been suffering from hoarseness since 1887, when in May a carcinoma in his throat was identified. He initially refused being operated on and instead went to a mountain resort in Italy, hoping the climate would improve his condition. Meanwhile his doctors were hiding the fact that the carcinoma was increasingly growing. Shortly before William I's death, he could barely breathe, leading to a tracheotomy which robbed him of his voice. His 3-month reign was severely limited, his plans for limiting monarchical power and strengthening the constitution never coming to fruition. His last diary entry was: 'What's happening to me? I must get well again, I have so much to do!'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

WILLIAMTWOINTERVIEW;In a recent interview of Kaiser Wilhelm II by the Daily Telegraph, our monarch had several emotional outbursts. These scandalous remarks have now been published, greatly diminishing our foreign relations. Especially the British were enraged by the quote: 'You English are mad, mad, mad as March hares.

Richardson, leading his party rode close to Shimazu's procession and did not dismount despite being gestured repeatedly to do so.

If you then get the conservatives to win the election either via event that lets you choose between Napoleon III and Cavaignac or by normal election and you keep the conservatives in power until 1851, you will get an event for Napoleon III's coup in the election. This sets you to an absolute empire, allowing you to appoint your ruling party and giving you more expansion paths, such as the Luxemburg Purchase, claiming Catalonia, the Second French Intervention in Mexico and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CHRISTIANDEATH;After ruling for 8 years, King Christian VIII has died today at age 61. His demise was caused by blood poisoning inflicted accidentally by medicinal bloodletting. Before his passing, he was long faced with a dilemma: His son, Frederick VII, was without heirs and had two divorces behind him, bringing danger to the family line, but due to differing succession laws, passing the monarchy to his niece Louise von Hessen would have split the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein from the Danish crown. Christian could not fulfill his last ambition, namely a new united constitution for both Denmark and the duchies that would guarantee safe inheritance to Louise, and so the crown has passed to Frederick. Amid the chaos of 1848 erupting in Europe however, the demand for a new constitution continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARCHREVLOC;With the insecurity of the government following the late King Christian's passing, much confusion has spread among the populace. Fearing centralization efforts by the government, representatives from Schleswig and Holstein have gathered in Rendsburg to discuss the government's alleged plans regarding a new constitution. A messenger informing the residents of Copenhagen of the gathering, but the news quickly spun out of control, making people think a rebellion had begun in the duchies. Furious citizens marched to the royal palace to demand a new constitution to assert dominance over the supposed revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Connecting Lake Onega to the White Sea enables shipping to connect over Lake Ladoga to the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea, enabling ships to sail straight to the White Sea instead of having to go North of Norway. The region will surely experience an economic upturn with the sudden increase in trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AVEZZANOQUAKE;A large earthquake with the epicenter in the village of Avezzano has struck the province of L'Avila. It was so strong that it could be felt in Rome: Saint John's Basilica reported a fallen statue.

HAIYUANQUAKE;An immense earthquake has struck the area around the epicenter in Haiyuan seeing the largest recorded death toll out of any earthquake in history. Entire villages were buried in landslides, and nearly all the houses collapsed in a large radius around Haiyuan.

In total, around 250.000 people died in the tragedy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KRALINCIDENT;Following our revolt against Austria, Slovaks have been fearing magyarization.

These demands soon landed the pair in jail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SLOVAKMANIFESTO;A new manifesto has been issued by Slovak nationalists, dubbed 'Demands of the Slovak Nation'. It was made up of fourteen points, including but not limited to equality and fraternal coexistance of all people in Hungary, adoption of the Slovak language as an official language in government offices and schools, establishment of a Slovak national guard, introduction of full voting rights for adult males, official recognition of Slovak symbols, abolition of laws limiting the freedoms of the press, of assembly and of association, reformation of land ownership by restoring the land that had been seized from the peasants by the Hungarian aristocracy and transformation of Hungary into a decentralised state consisting of equal nationsm each with its own parliament and equal representation in the Diet of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

kisilev_reforms_desc;Leader of the 5th department of His Imperial Majesty's Chancellery, Pavel Dmitrievich Kiselev has proposed a number of reforms aimed at the eventual abolition of serfdom and improvement of the Russian administration. These include creating chambers of state property with a state property district each, split into departments of forestry and general economic departments with district chiefs at the head of both. Depending on the local population, these districts could cover one or more counties, with subdivisions into volosts with a local government elected for three years and parishes within the volosts which in turn would consist of villages, each with its own local gathering that would elect a village elder for three years, assign policemen and decide on local sentences for misdemeanors. Another proposal is giving landowners the right to free their serfs at their will, concluding an agreement with them on the provision of land allotments to them in hereditary possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purandar Singha is himself found guilty of gathering personal fortune rather than concentrating on good governance for his people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAYASSEMBLY;Following the Hungarian war of independence against Austria, Serbians have grown increasingly uneasy about Magyar rule. Political leaders of the Serbs have decided to hold an assembly demanding a separate Serb voivodeship within the areas of Syrmia, Baranja, Backa, the Becej District, Banat and the Kikinda District. Secondary demands include sending a delegation to the slavic congress in Prague and recognizing Romanian ethnic sovereignty. If we do not recognize the voivodeship of Vojvodina, there will be a revolt threatening our war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

POORBIRD;The Great Auk, a species of bird long dwindling in population long confined to a small island off the coast of Iceland, has gone extinct. The Great Auks numbered no more than fifty individuals on their last habitat on the island of Eldey where they were slowly killed due to museums desiring their skins for preservation and display. The last pair, found incubating an egg, was killed there on June 1844, on request from a merchant who wanted specimens, with locals Jón Brandsson and Sigurður Ísleifsson strangling the adults and Ketill Ketilsson smashing the egg with his boot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORSINIATTACK;Disgruntled Italian nationalist Felice Orsini attempted to assassinate Emperor Napoleon III last night. He believed that by killing him, he would cause a social revolution in France that would spread to Italy and lead to the unification of the Italian peninsula. At 8:30 PM, as Napoléon and his wife Eugénie were taking a carriage to the opera, Orsini struck with his accomplices. Three bombs were tossed next to the royal carriage, however its special armoring saved the royal couples' lives. Pedestrians were not so lucky, for 12 died that same night and 156 more were injured. Orsini and his co-conspirators were arrested on the spot, tried and sentenced to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUSENSTOLP;A series of riots has taken place in Stockholm, caused by the Swedish Court of Appeals' decision to sentence the publicist Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe to three years' imprisonment for lèse-majesté for insulting King Karl XIV Johan. The action of the king that Crusenstolpe criticized was having promoted a noble two military ranks at once instead of the usual single rank who, in addition, did not prove himself deserving of a promotion. This perceived unjust punishment of the fair criticism given by Crusenstolpe led to several riotous crowds gathering in Stockholm to demand his release and, in one case, even attempt to storm his prison. In the end, 2 people died and 5 were seriously injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASTORPLACE;Tensions in New York have boiled over in a nativist riot against British actor William Charles Macready as his feud with the American actor Edwin Forrest came to a head. The two had long been friends, both doing tours of each others countries, however in recent years they have developed a rivalry that galvanized the lower, anti-British class against the upper, pro-British class in New York. Macready's performance at Astor Place Theater was interrupted by a crowd breaking down the doors. As Macready escaped through the back exit, cops began beating the rioters with their batons to get a hold on the situation. This had the opposite effect: More and more people joined the mob and drove back the police, leading to state troopers having to be deployed to restore order. 25 rioters died and over 120 were injured, and Astor Place Theater will forever be known as "DisAstor Place".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOODYSUNDAY;This Sunday, some 10,000 people gathered in Trafalgar Square, London, to protest against unemployment and coercion in Ireland. 2,000 police and 400 soldiers were deployed to forcibly disperse the crowd with batons, arresting 400 and injuring 75. Many protestors were armed with iron bars, knives, pokers and gas pipes to defend their protest, escalating the ensuing conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GAVAZZIRIOT;Riots have occured in Quebec City and Montreal by mobs which attacked halls in which ex-Catholic monk Alessandro Gavazzi was lecturing. The principal participants were Irish Catholics who were angered by Gavazzi's sentiments. Gavazzi attributed the failure of the Italian national movement of 1848-49 to the defection of Pope Pius IX from the cause, and therefore rejected Catholicism. In both cases, strong bodies of police had been stationed nearby in anticipation of disturbances and shot into the crowds indiscriminately, dispersing them with ease. 5 people died and many more were injured, while Gavazzi arrived back in Italy safe and sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MONTREALPARLIAMENTBURN;Last night, following a series of riots by conservatives in Canada in response to the Rebellion Losses Bill, an angry mob of about 1,500 gathered in Montreal and burned down the parliament buildings. Over 22,000 books were lost, but nobody was seriously injured. Soon after, police began rounding up people under suspicion of having participated in the torching while the parliament temporarily moved into a church to be safe in its sanctity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANSTRIKEONE;Last week, about 200,000 workers participated in a strike to pressure the government into introducing universal voting rights inspired by the strike of 1886.

BELGIANSTRIKETWO;A small gathering organised by anarchists in Liège met with unexpected support, partly as a result of the ongoing economic downturn and harsh winter. Between 800-900 workers, many from the city's metal works, attended the initial demonstration. Rather than abating, the strike spread like a wildfire through the industrial areas where bloody clashes with police ensued. Several dozen people gave their lives to the cause that, in the end, yielded no results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

vuk_karadzic_reform_desc;Vuk Stefanovic Karadic has reformed the Serbian literary language and standardized the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet by following strict phonemic principles on the Johann Christoph Adelung model and Jan Hus Czech alphabet. Karadic's reforms of the Serbian literary language modernized it and distanced it from Serbian and Russian Church Slavonic and brought it closer to common folk speech. However, he has a eastern Bosnian accent which many in northern Serbia and Vojvodina have difficulty adapting to. Officially recognizing it will help us more efficiently run our schools, however it will also require a short period of adaptation to the dialect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BLOODYMONDAY;Religious tensions against Catholic immigrants have spiked in Louisville, Kentucky, where on election day, mobs of Irish and German immigrants clashed with crowds of shotgun-armed nativist Kentuckians. Twenty-two people died and five were arrested. Several city blocks were burnt to the ground by the fire formed in the ensuing chaos. The mayor, despite himself being a nativist, called to end the fighting and form a bucket line to quell the flames, thereby saving the church and many other homes within Louisville.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

City planners have suggested taking an undeveloped area and placing a large water tower to be designed in an architectural competition in the middle, making the surroundings into a park and rounding them off with an ornate details and statues on the tower. This will create a pleasant place to relax for generations to come while the city expands around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATHRIOT;A riot has taken place in Bath, Maine, where a traveling street-preacher named John S. Orr, who calls himself 'The Angel Gabriel', dressing in white robes, and carrying a trumpet. Orr delivered an anti-Catholic sermon on a commercial street, the crowd of spectators eventually swelling to over a thousand and blocking carriage traffic. After the sermon, the angry crowd burnt down the Catholic church and patrolled the streets all night to intimidate the Irish immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MONTPELEEERUPTS;It began 15 days ago, when the inhabitants of Saint-Pierre, the largest city of Martinique, awoke to a huge column of steam arising from Mont Pelée, the volcano long thought to be extinct that looms above the city. Over the next few days, eruptions increased in intensity. As lightning laced the eruption clouds and trade winds dumped ash on villages to the West, many fled to the perceived safety of Saint-Pierre. Today, at 8:00 AM  A ground-hugging cloud of incandescent lava particles suspended by searing gases moved at hurricane speed down the Southwest flank of the volcano, reaching the city at 8:02 AM. Escape was virtually impossible. Almost everyone withinabout 28,000 peopledied, burned or buried by falling masonry. The hot ash ignited a firestorm, fueled by smashed buildings and countless casks of rum. Only two people survived within the city, along with a few tens of people caught within the margins of the cloud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TARAWERAERUPTION;Shortly after midnight this morning, a series of more than 30 increasingly strong earthquakes was felt in the Rotorua area and an unusual sheet lightning display was observed from the direction of Tarawera. At around 2:00 AM, a larger earthquake was felt and followed by the sound of an explosion. By 2:30 AM, Mount Tarawera's three peaks erupted, blasting three distinct columns of smoke and ash thousands of meters into the sky. By 3:30 AM, the eruption reached its most destructive phase when a pyroclastic surge destroyed several villages within a 6-kilometer radius, and obliterated the Pink and White Terraces, a natural terraced hotspring of which there are less than a dozen worldwide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KALATCOLLAPSE;Shah Nawaz Khan, a direct descendant of Mahabat Khan who had been dethroned by the Durranis, was installed at only 14 years of age by the Brits as Khan of Kalat after they had invaded and killed Mir Mehrab Khan Baloch II to secure the route through Kalat to Kandahar in the Anglo-Afghan War. Nawaz Khan was deposed by Mir Nasir Khan II, throwing off the British yoke but throwing the country into turmoil. The already autonomous vassal states of Las Bela, Kohistan and Makran have taken advantage of the situation to become fully independent, while Kharan remains nominally aligned to the Khan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME91179;The Normanton Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91179;A British vessel called the Normanton was wrecked off the cape of Kashinozaki, running aground and forcing its crewmen and passengers to evacuate. The crew all survived and escaped on lifeboats. The 25 Japanese passengers aboard, however, all perished, supposedly without any chance to secure lifeboats for themselves. The case is currently tried in a court for British subjects in Japan. The locals, meanwhile, are highly skeptical of the case's facts: they do not easily believe that the Japanese passengers had no means of surviving, and they speculate the Normanton's crew simply refused to give the passengers lifeboats. The Normanton's crew was all British, save for 12 Indians and Chinese. It is easily assumed that the British crewmen sacrificed the passengers' lives simply because they were Japanese. But because the case is not being adjudicated by our own court, it will be difficult to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SUNMIRACLE;A prophecy by three shepherd children, Lúcia Santos and Francisco and Jacinta Marto lead a large number of pilgrims to head for the town of Fátima. The prophecy foretold that on the 3rd October 1917, the the Virgin Mary would appear and perform miracles. An estimated crowd of between 30.000-100.000 eyewitnesses watched in awe as the sun  appeared to 'dance' or zig-zag in the sky, careen towards the Earth, or emit multicolored light and radiant colors. According to these reports, the event lasted approximately ten minutes. While some deem this to be a simple occurance of mass hysteria caused by staring intently into the sun, many of the faithful regard it as a holy event, declaring Fatíma a holy city for being the only place to witness the occurances. The catholic church itself has not given any clear support or doubt to the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PONYEXPRESS;Operated by the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company, the Pony Express is of great financial importance to the U.S. It reduces the time for messages to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to about 10 days. It has become the West's most direct means of east-west communication, and is vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the United States. It relies on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses going from station to station with around 10 miles inbetween each. Thus the riders can gallop nonstop by exchanging a tired horse for fresh one at every station. The route, following the Oregon and California trails to Fort Bridger, taking the Hastings Cutoff to Salt Lake City and the Central Nevada Route to Carson City over the Sierra Nevada to Sacramento is around 1.900 miles long and was traversed in a record 7 days when bringing the news of Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MIANIBATTLE;General James Napier, formerly the governor of the Ionian island of Kefalonia, has long been on the search for glory. Becoming general of the honorable East India Comany's Bombay Army was just the chance he needed. Without consulting London, he marched into Sindh to demand diplomatic concessions from Mir Nasir Khan Talpur. He was quite surprised when the Mir begrudgingly accepted these as he had planned to use his refusal as pretext for an invasion. After sullenly marching out of Sindh, he had a change of heart and crossed the border once more to bring Sindh into the fold of the British Empire, winning the first engagement with the Sindhi conscripts with ease. Now that word of this has reached us, shall we order Napier to stand down or give approval to him finishing his little war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
