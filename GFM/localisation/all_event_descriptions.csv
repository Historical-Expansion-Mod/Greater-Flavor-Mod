EVTDESC123824;\n\nSir James Hope has arrived with two warships in Tsushima to prevent our show of force to the Japanese and contain our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123825;\n\nSeeing the island of Tsushima as not worth a war, the Russians have relinquished their demands and accepted our decision to deny the lease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123823;\n\nBritain has turned a blind eye to our landing on Tsushima. This leaves us a free hand to pressure the Shogunate into accepting the lease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123822;\n\nRussia has dispatched the corvette Posadnik to Tsushima island to intimidate the Shogun into granting a lease on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
