EVTNAME110000;The Right wins the Election!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110000;\n\nThough our constitution, our laws, our national ethos and our very raison d'être are founded on liberalism, republicanism, secular humanism, rationalism, modernism and progressivism, the right wing parties have won the last election, challenging the very core of our republic. While many on the left argue that we must accept the election results, lest we forgo our democratic principles, this would surely mean that our country will be forever changed by the new government's planned policies. There is, however, a group of staunch, militant radicals that advocates for forcibly wresting power from the right to prevent them from setting us back by decades. Our nation's destiny is in our hands, and whatever we choose will certainly majorly impact our future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
