EVTDESC377903;\n\nWith the loss of any direct connection to our holdings in the interior of Algeria, our rule in the region has collapsed. A native warlord has taken over the region in the northern Sahara, and the few French colonial administrators in the region have fled. Unless the North African coast can be recovered by our forces, we are unlikely to re-establish a foothold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
