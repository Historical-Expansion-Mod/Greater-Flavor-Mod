EVTOPTBAD;This is bad news for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTGOOD;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTNO;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTOHNO;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTYES;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101532;The Ruthenian Triad Publishes 'The Mermaid of the Dniester';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101532;\n\nIn 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by Markiyan Shashkevych, published 'The Mermaid of the Dniester', a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan sought to ban the book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA101532;Ban the book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB101532;Let them have their book;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101533;Lajos Kossuth Released;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101533;\n\nA prominent Hungarian liberal, Lajos Kossuth, has finally been released from jail, along with other notable liberals. Since his release he has become something of a national hero to many Hungarians, and he has continued his opposition towards our government. As the editor of the Pesti Hirlap he has talked about the great economic and societal problems within Hungary, advocated full national autonomy within the Habsburg Empire, the immediate emancipation of the serfs - with no compensation to aristocrats - and an end of noble privileges. He has also promoted industrialization by founding the Gyáralapito és Kereskedelmi Társaság (Factory-Founding and Commercial Society).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA101533;Another mouthpiece for the nationalists...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101534;End the Publication of the Pesti Hirlap?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101534;\n\nWe have tried to put an end to Kossuth's hostility to our rule for some time now. His criticism of our rule in Hungary is highly influential and therefore highly damaging for us. His chief political weapon is a liberal rag, the Pesti Hirlap, in which he has been able to express his radical views. Perhaps if we were to purchase the newspaper we could put an end to Kossuth's ramblings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA101534;We must stop this anti-government drivel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB101534;Let it continue to circulate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101535;Hungarian Moderates Sidelined;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101535;By our refusal to ratify reforms that many Hungarians have wanted since 1825, we've sidelined the moderates who wanted reforms but no national autonomy. Kossuth's articles against us in the Pesti Hirlap were the last straw and now the radicals, especially Kossuth, hold the love of the people and more importantly, the majority in Parliament. The Hungarians will not settle for anything less than an autonomous national government. Széchényi István, the very man who started the call for reforms in 1825, writes articles attacking the Pesti Hirlap and Kossuth himself, and together with the moderates, they either join the radicals or like Széchényi drift towards the conservatives. There is now no middle ground in Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101536;Frantisek Palacky and the Czech National Revival;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101536;Considered one of the fathers of modern Czech nation, Palacky played a leading role in the Czech cultural and national revival of the early nineteenth century. At first a proponent of Austro-Slavism, a view that advocated unification and autonomy of Slavs within the framework of the Habsburg monarchy, Palacky later called for complete Czech independence. Palacky's greatest literary contribution was his History of Bohemia, which significantly influenced growing Czech national consciousness as it saw the history of Bohemia as a constant struggle of Germans and Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101537;France Preseren and the Slovenian National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101537;A key figure in the development of Slovene nationalism, Preseren led a movement to promote the use of Slovene instead of German at a time when Slovene was dismissed by the Austrian ruling elite as a peasant language, and was not taught in schools. A skilled poet, his works include Zdravljica, which was censored at the time for its national and Pan-Slavic message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# Flavor Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME146604;The Tango;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC146604;\n\nFirst appearing during the second half of the 19th century among the popular classes of Buenos Aires, tango became a cultural institution in Argentina. More than a dance, tango became a sign of the Argentine desire to afirm their own identity. Melancholic, very moving and expressive, it became famous around the world and Argentina became 'el pais del tango'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA146604;Bailamos!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME146605;President Campos Sales visits Argentina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC146605;The president of Brazil has made an official visit to Buenos Aires, with three days of celebration to promote Brazilian-Argentine friendship. The Chilean press, however, suspects that there is a secret alliance between Argentina and Brazil in the works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME146303;O Guarani;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC146303;The composer Carlos Gomes has debuted his new opera O Guarani (The Guarani) to much acclaim at the La Scala Opera House in Milan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME146305;Dom Pedro II Weds;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC146305;\n\nIn spite of the fact that the new consort looked nothing like the pictures sent to the Emperor to help make his choice, after initial hesitations the Emperor has decided to accept his marriage to Princess Teresa Cristina, daughter of the King of the Two Sicilies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME146308;Establishment of the National Academy of Letters;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC146308;To encourage the further evolution of Brazilian literature and arts, Machado de Assis helped establish and became the first president of the National Academy of Letters in 1876.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME137400;Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC137400;The 'Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal van Van Dale' was the first Dutch dictionary. It was first published after the death of Johan Hendrik van Dale, who had started work on his New Dictionary of the Dutch Language in 1867. This was built upon the original same-named 1864 dictionary of I.M. Calisch and N.S. Calisch. Van Dale did not see the new work published in his lifetime, as he died in 1872. It was finished by his student Jan Manhave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME137401;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC137401;\n\nThe Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam was founded in $YEAR$ by a group of orthodox-Protestant Christians led by Abraham Kuyper as the first Calvinist university in the Netherlands. Kuyper was a theologian, journalist, politician, and prime minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905. He was a professor of theology as well as the university's first rector magnificus (academic president). Kuyper's philosophy is referred to as Neo-Calvinism. As a reflection of his beliefs, Vrije Universiteit literally means 'Free University' (or 'Liberated University') to signify independence from both government and church. Teaching at the Vrije Universiteit started in 1880 in rooms rented at the Scottish Missionary Church (now the Kleine Komedie theatre), along the Amstel river in Amsterdam's city center. Here, Kuyper and four fellow professors began lecturing in three faculties -- theology, law, and the arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
act_on_language_in_bohemia_title;Act on Language in Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
act_on_language_in_bohemia_desc;The rise of Czech nationalism led activist Czech politicians to increasingly demand reform in Bohemia that would make Czech an official language of internal administration on par with German, and require all civil servants to know both languages. Needing Czech support in Parliament, on 5 March 1897 Austrian prime minister Badeni introduced a law that would fulfill the Czech demands. Bohemian Germans condemn the proposed legislation, which would benefit Czechs greatly since they learned both Czech and German in school while the Germans had not been required to learn Czech.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
state_visit_to_argentina_title;State Visit to Argentina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
state_visit_to_argentina_desc;President Campos Sales has been invited to Buenos Aires on an official visit to help promote closer relations between the two nations. The Chilean press, due to currently strained relations between Chile and Argentina, are speculating that we are about to form an alliance with Argentina against Chile. Should we accept the invitation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
##### Paraguay #####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
paraguayan_law_of_the_free_womb_title;Law of the Free Womb;;;;;;;;;;;;;
paraguayan_law_of_the_free_womb_desc;In 1842, Carlos Antonio López, rather than free the slaves, instead enacted the Law of the Free Womb, which ended the slave trade and guaranteed that the children of slaves would be free at age twenty-five. But the new law served only to increase the slave population and depress slave prices as slave birthrates soared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reaffirm_paraguayan_independence_title;Reaffirm Paraguayan Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reaffirm_paraguayan_independence_desc;On November 25th 1842, a congress that reaffirmed the Paraguayan independence from Argentina took place in Asuncion, which increased the Paraguayan national pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
start_the_campaign_against_the_guaranis_title;Start the Campaign Against the Guaranis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
start_the_campaign_against_the_guaranis_desc;In 1843, López undertook a bloody campaign against the Guarani Indians who inhabited yerba mate fields. López made yerba mate and exportable lumber properties of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
student_exchange_and_importation_of_technicians_title;Student Exchange and Importation of Technicians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
student_exchange_and_importation_of_technicians_desc;Carlos Antonio López, worried with the development of industry, instead of consuming the income gotten with leather and yerba-mate exports and with the tariffs imposed on imports of manufactured products, the new dictator chose to increase the technical expertise of the country, aiming at increasing internal production. Paraguayan students were sent to foreign nations and foreign technicians were contracted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_solano_lopez_to_europe_title;Send Solano López to Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_solano_lopez_to_europe_desc;In 1853, Francisco Solano López, Carlos Antonio López's son, traveled to Europe to buy arms for the Paraguayan army. In Europe he fell in love with Elisa Alicia Lynch, who would live with him until his last days. In Europe he also admired the trappings and pretensions of the French empire of Napoleon III.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_bulgaria_romania_bulgaria_title;The $YEAR$ Unification of Bulgaria & Romania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_bulgaria_romania_bulgaria_desc;Our unification has had many historical precedents: Bulgarians and Romanians had first lived together under the rule of the First Bulgarian Empire, which extended its power into areas that form part of Romania today; under the Second Bulgarian Empire, established through the cooperation of Bulgarians and Vlachs (Romanians); and under the Ottoman Empire, which defeated the Second Bulgarian Empire and conquered and ruled territories populated by Bulgarians and Romanians for centuries. During the late 18th century, a popular concept emerged in the Balkans: the federalization of the region, aimed at fighting nearby empires and solving conflicts between its peoples. Together our nations stand a greater chance to stand against our neighbors and chart our own destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;

invite_christian_missionaries_title;Invite Christian Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invite_christian_missionaries_desc;We are a Christian nation without a Christian people, this is unacceptable. We must invite missionaries to help sway our population to the true faith. If we're lucky, they might even bring with them western advancements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
christianity_with_chinese_characteristics_title;Christianity with Chinese Characteristics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
christianity_with_chinese_characteristics_desc;We are the most Christian of all nations, the westerners have the right idea but their minds are clouded. Our ancestors, while not Christians, were wise men who some, one must concluded, must have been even holier than several western theologians. We must follow the lord and his word, but without losing our most holy and noble heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_mandate_of_heaven_title;Claim the Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_mandate_of_heaven_desc;While we'd rather distance ourselves from old traditions it's now become more and more clear that we can never fully claim the right to China without also following one of the oldest of Chinese monarchial principals; The Mandate of Heaven, a title, supposedly, bestowed from heaven itself. To fully legitimize our rule over all of China we must use this justification, however to do this we must prove that heaven truly is with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME160028;Missionaries move to China;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160028;After, the now Christian nation that is China, requested help in converting the population, several of our clergymen have moved to help the Chinese cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260501;Diego Portales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260501;Diego Portales was a Chilean statesman and entrepreneur who played a pivotal role in shaping the Chilean state and government politics in the 19th century, delivering with the Constitution of 1833 the framework of the Chilean state for almost a century. Portales influential political stance included unitarianism, presidentialism and conservatism which led to consolidate Chile as a constitutional authoritarian republic with democracy restricted to include only upper class men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260502;Diego Portales has been assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260502;The war against our northern neighbors was not welcomed by all in Chile. Instead of promoting national unity, the liberals have used the war to criticize Portales and his ruling policy. Last week he had ordered the execution of 3 liberals in the town of Curicó, and today a rebel group of soldiers captures Portales and executed him in Quillota. The whole country is in chaos and expecting us to make an official statement. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260503;Revolution is in the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260503;The resignation and self-exile of General Bernardo O'Higgins in 1823 did not put an end to the Chilean political infighting. The Chilean political scene divided itself into two groups that were already embryonary during the independence days. One group was mainly composed by the remains of the colonial aristocracy, and defended the ideas of a strong central government, respect of tradition and a strong support for the Catholic Church called the Pelucones. And on the other end of the spectrum we had the Pipiolos who proposed a small government and freedom of trade. Now that the Pipiolos  and liberals are gaining more power they have started to push major social reforms, polarizing the population. The Pelucones have control of the newspapers are using them to push the situation to a boiling point. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260504;A new constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260504;After almost three years of assassination attempts and hurling insults at each other, the Chilean political parties have agreed to sit down and find an agreement. From this agreement we will write a new Constitution that will put an end to the Chilean civil war and will hopefully be one of the most long-lived constitutions of Latin America. Representatives from all parties have made sure that it can be used to endorse both an authoritarian presidentialist system or an oligarchic parliamentary system down the road. What kind of government do the Chileans need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260505;La cuestión del sacristán.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260505;Bishop Rafael Valdivieso, dean of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago, fired a sacristan named Pedro Santelices. Apparently he invited some friends for a meeting at the parish, but the Holy Wine got the better of them and a stone destroyed the skylight! However, Pedro raised the issue to the religious tribunal of La Serena, who ruled in his favor. Unhappy with the result, the Bishop is now seeking our support to intervene since he's going to raise the issue to The Supreme Court of Justice. Intervening will have political consequences, but it will appease the ecclesiastic authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260506;Loss of support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260506;Many Chileans are outraged by your support of the Bishop in what most see as a religious matter. Even your own supporters are criticizing your administration for not respecting the separation of the powers of the State and allowing the Church to openly question the Supreme Court. The issue is all over the newspapers and our political party has been permanently divided and radicalized. You have lost the support of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260507;Ley de inmigración selectiva.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260507;The port of Valparaíso has become one of the most important centers of commerce in the southern hemisphere. It is the first major port after the dangerous Cape Horn that unites the Atlantic of the Pacific and most immigrant ships stay there for a few days before resuming their travel north. Vicente Pérez Rosales, one of our brightest advisors, has devised an innovative plan to convince them to settle in southern Chile instead of continue their travel. Other countries may not be happy about us implementing this policy, but it's well worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260508;Siempre vencedor, jamás vencido.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260508;Our neighbors seem to have forgotten how bravely we fought by their side against the Spanish, and some are suggesting that it's because our army is falling behind in the arms race. One of our officers insists that a reminder of our might is long overdue, and tells us that the British have developed a new type of gun that greatly outmatches anything we have seen on this side of the ocean. He also mentioned that there's several British investors who feel than an armed Chile is in their best interest as well. Unless we want to change the army's motto, we should make this investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIT198260509;The Liberal Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260509;A lot have changed since the Civil War tore our country apart decades ago. While the new constitution did bring the reforms the people wanted, there's a liberal minority that feel the current government's constant political persecution is unacceptable. Arms re being stolen regularly from some our supply depots, and we suspect some officers may be involved. We could try to avert the problem by siding with the radical faction, but going against the ruling party is going to make us look weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liberation_of_mendoza_title;The liberation of Mendoza;;;;;;;;;;;;x #true story brah. To this day, they are still mocked by porteños for their "Chilean" accent.;
TIT198260510;The Liberation of Perú.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DSC198260510;Following the Battle of Maipú and the subsequent liberation of Chile, the Ejército Libertador began the preparations for an amphibious assault force to liberate Peru. Originally the costs were to be assumed by both Chile and Argentina, however our government ended up assuming most of costs of the campaign since Bernardo O'Higgins was convinced that Chile would never be safe until Perú was free of the Spanish yoke. It was determined that the Chilean-Argentinian land army was going to be led by José de San Martín, whilst the navy was to be commanded by admiral "lord" Thomas Alexander Cochrane while Bernardo O'Higgins would remain in Chile as Supreme Director of the Republic. We will not stop until all our Latin American brothers are free! We will live with honor or die with glory! Those who are brave will follow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liberation_of_mendoza_desc;Mendoza was founded by Chileans and remained part of the Capitanía General de Chile under Spanish rule for over two centuries. Later, when the Virreinato de La Plata was created on 1776 Chile and all its lands were transferred to the Argentinians. At this point Buenos Aires decided that Mendoza and all of our land east of the Andes would remain under Argentinian rule. Today, we have reverted this decision. From now on we will march with our mendocinian brothers. Once again we will fight for freedom side by side under the same flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_of_atacama_title;By reason or by force;;;;;;;;;;;;x #Sadly, this is true. Peruvians wore black clothes on the day of their national holidays to protest for the ban.;
conquest_of_atacama_desc;The desert of Atacama is finally under Chilean control. While most of the population is very happy to be under our benevolent rule, large amounts of Bolivians and Peruvians make no attempt to conceal their contempt and some even dare to question our right to hold these lands. In light of the current events, we have decided that all citizens are forbidden to celebrate foreign holidays and shall sing our national anthem before any public act. They will all become Chilean, by reason or by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

greater_norway_title;Norgesveldet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
greater_norway_desc;After the rise of romantic nationalism in Norway spanning from 1840 to 1865, the term "Norgesveldet" swept through the country reminding people of how great Norway used to be on the map! We colonized Iceland, we colonized Greenland, and legend even has it that we colonized Newfoundland before anyone else! Sweden robbed us of our past territories and our old deal with Novgorod to split the northern Nordics is invalid as Novgorod no longer exists. It's time to step away from the sidelines and once again become the great power our beautiful country deserves to be! The time has come to re-establish Norgesveldet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAUTOKEINO;The Kautokeino Uprising of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAUTOKEINODESC;\n\nNews has reached us that 67 Samis lead by Aslak Hætta have rebelled in Kautokeino, killing 2 Norwegians and burning down buildings! What has apparently incited the incident is the internment of a family which refused to attend an obligatory Christian church service that we kindly provide to the Samis to civilize them. Instead, they rather listened to the teachings of the controversial heretic Lars Levi Læstadius who tries to stop honest Norwegian merchants from selling alcohol to the Sami population. Generally, Sami natives are angered due to our well-meaning efforts to civilize them by sharing our beautiful language and religion. In face of the uprising, the future course of action must be decided. We could reverse our assimilation policies and instead implement Sami as a co-language equal to Norwegian to gain further support -- and perhaps justify future attempts to conquer Finnish, Swedish or Russian territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ACCEPTSAMI;We need to share the nation with the Kvens and the Sami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

sapmi_rename_title;Reclaim the Sami Heartland;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After all, having Sami as a recognized language would be meaningless if we didn't promote its usage. However, if we ever own the Kola peninsula, we shall promote Norwegian immigration there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_INDEPENDENCE; The Norwegian Monarchy Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_INDEPENDENCE_DESC;\n\nThe Unionsoppløsningen (the dissolving of the union) is finally here! After hundreds of years of oppression, we're finally ready to show the world what we're worthy of--but to do that, we need to establish a new government. 74% of our people favor a monarchy. The rest call for a republic to be established. Whichever we choose, the people will be happy regardless;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_REPUBLIC;Establish a republic for the people! Monarchies have toyed with us for long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_MONARCHY;A constitutional monarchy to protect both tradition and democracy! (historical);;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_ABSOLUTE_MONARCHY;We need a king with firm control to maintain Norway's independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_provoke_swe_title;Strengthen the Norwegian Military;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_provoke_swe_desc;Karl Johan is quite angry that we have deployed a mere three brigades of guards--but his feelings mean nothing to us. He is at fault for violating the Convention of Moss, which established the personal union of Sweden and Norway, by cracking down on our autonomy. This is just our way to enforce the union's terms. We know that Karl Johan is a fanatic who dreams of annexing us, and it was only thanks to our defense in 1814 that our autonomy currently survives. Denmark's current king, Christian Frederik, ruled as our own king briefly during the war with Sweden in 1814 and abdicated after we lost. If we contact him and request his backing, he'd surely help--and if we provoke Sweden into declaring war, we could finally gain our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_lang_decision_title;Settle the Written Language Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_lang_decision_desc;At this time, we have three written languages our people use. The upper class and government use Danish, while easterners use Bokmål, and westerners and northerners use Nynorsk. The huge dialectical differences between regions is impeding our growth as a nation. We must decide which written variant of Norwegian we shall promote as the official one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_LANG;Time has come to decide the main language for Norway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_LANG_DESC;\n\nIvar Aasen (left) is the spokesperson for his so-called "real Norwegian," based on the language people in the western Norwegian countryside speak. Knud Knudsen (right) is the spokesperson for the Danish-influenced Norwegian often spoken by the upper class--the urban population generally in eastern Norway. Aasen's variant is known as Landsmål/Nynorsk and Knudsen's variant is known as Riksmål/Bokmål. Aasen released his first dictionary in 1848 and Knudsen released his first dictionary in 1862. This is not just a language debate. This is a debate of identity. By choosing Riksmål as our language's standard, we will express our gratitude over our earlier Danish protectors while still proclaiming our sovereignty. By choosing Landsmål, however, we will promote a patriotic and nostalgic direction for our country. Naturally, choosing a standard variant of our language less influenced by Danish would arouse nationalism, which we could embrace by moving our capital back to its historical location, the city of Bergen. Bergen also happens to be where the dialect closest to Landsmål is still spoken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1000200;Now that we are powerful enough to hold our own, an important matter rose up regarding our role in the Eastern Christendom. It is a well known fact that the Byzantine Empire for a long time was the center of the Orthodox Church and the Eastern Christendom as a whole. Sadly, we've lost our authority and power due to numerous wars and raids and our title as the protector was taken by an another powerful Orthodox nation known as the Russian Empire. We are glad that they've been doing our work for centuries now, but it's time that we take this title back since it's supposed to be us that should protect the Eastern Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_meiji_restoration2_desc;Japan is traditionally considered to have been founded by Emperor Jimmu in 660 B.C. and while the Imperial Lineage was still considered unbroken since then the Imperial Office had throughout the Edo period     been reduced to a revered and respected but ultimately     politically powerless institution. By embracing a restoration of Imperial Rule     along with a program of swift industrial modernization constitutionalism and economic freedom Japan might be able to break the fetters placed upon her by the impositions of the Western World.;Selon la tradition, le Japon aurait été fondé par l'empereur Jimmu en 660 avant notre ère et alors que la lignée impériale aurait depuis été ininterrompue, le Bureau impérial n'était, pendant la période Edo, qu'une institution, certes respectée, mais privée de pouvoir politique. Moyennant le rétablissement du règne impérial, ainsi que la mise ne place d'un vaste program de modernisation industriel, de constitutionalisme et de liberté économique, le Japon devrait pouvoir rompre les fers que lui a imposé le monde occidental.;Die Gründung Japans wird üblicherweise dem Kaiser Jimmu im Jahr 660 v.Chr. zugeschrieben und obwohl die kaiserliche Abstammungslinie seitdem ununterbrochen ist     wurde das Kaiseramt während der Edo-Zeit kontinuierlich zu einer verehrten und respektierten aber letztendlich machtlosen politischen Institution reduziert. Durch die Restauration der kaiserlichen Herrschaft im Einklang einem Programm für rasche industrielle Modernisierung     Konstitutionalismus und Gewerbefreiheit könnte Japan die Fesseln sprengen     die ihm von der westlichen Welt angelegt wurden.;;Tradicionalmente     se considera que Japón fue fundado por el emperador Jimmu en el año 660 a. de.C. y     aunque el linaje imperial se considera ininterrumpido desde entonces a lo largo del período Edo la función del Emperador fue reducida a una institución venerada y respetada pero carente de poder político. Al adoptar la restauración del gobierno imperial     junto a un programa de rápida modernización industrial     constitucionalismo y libertad económica     Japón puede ser capaz de romper las cadenas de las imposiciones del mundo occidental.;;;;;;;;;

The treaty would establish the border from the Rio Negro northwestward along the Amazon River-Orinoco watershed divide, then generally southward along various river courses and straight-line segments to the mouth of the Apaporis River.

pressburg_rename_ger_title;Bratislava, Preporok, Pressburg, Pozsony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pressburg_rename_ger_desc;The city received its contemporary name in 1919. Until then, it was mostly known in English by its German name, Pressburg, since after 1526 it was dominated mostly by the Habsburg Monarchy and the city had a relevant ethnic-German population. That is the term from which the pre-1919 Slovak (Preporok) name is derived. The city's Hungarian name, Pozsony, was given after the castle's first castellan, "Poson". The origin of the name is unclear. During the revolution of 1918-1919, the name 'Wilsonov' or 'Wilsonstadt' (after President Woodrow Wilson) was proposed by American Slovaks, as he supported national self-determination. The name Bratislava, which had been used only by some Slovak patriots, became official in March 1919 with the aim that a Slavic name could support the demands that the city should be part of Czechoslovakia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a de facto independent country, the inhabitants of the Couto Misto had many privileges, including exemption from military service and taxes, and could grant asylum to outsiders and deny access to any foreign military contingent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mughal_declaration_eic_desc;Unrest dominates the territory of the former Mughal Empire, now controlled by the British. There are calls for jihad by Muslim leaders like Maulana Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi and the millenarian Ahmedullah Shah, which were taken up by Muslims, particularly artisans, which caused the British to think that the Muslims were the main force behind this unrest. The Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, resisted these calls for jihad because, it has been suggested, he feared outbreaks of communal violence. By abiding to these calls, expelling the British from Delhi and declaring a Jihad, by shaking off the British influence and dominance, the Shah can be acclaimed Emperor of India, his rightful title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

support_january_uprising_desc;After Martial Law was declared, those designated for conscription secretly fled from Warsaw (Jan. 14-15, 1863), sought refuge in the nearby woodlands, and on January 22 issued a manifesto calling for a national insurrection. Although they were greatly outnumbered, poorly equipped, and successful in only a few engagements, the rebels gained support among the artisan, worker, lower gentry, and official classes in the cities and stimulated peasant revolts against the large landlords in rural areas. We could support this uprising against the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

finnish_diet_desc;Not until June 1863, after the Crimean War had taken place, did Alexander II call the Finnish Diet again. On September 18 the opening ceremony was held and the Emperor made his declaration where he promised to introduce changes to the constitution. The changes included making the diet a regularly convening body, a promise which was kept by the Emperor when the diet convened again in January 1867. The result was greater Finnish Autonomy within the Russian Empire and a improvement in the relations of the Finnish Parliament and the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

switch_to_early_russian_tech_desc;Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality, also known as Official Nationality was the dominant ideological doctrine of Russian emperor Nicholas I. "The Triad" of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833 circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev and Nikolay Gogol. Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia's first statewide political ideology since the sixteenth century, indicated the nation's brewing transition to modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

switch_to_russian_intelligentsia_desc;The Crimean War awakened the new Russian emperor Alexander II (who succeeded Nicholas I in March 1855) to the need to overcome Russia's backwardness in order to compete successfully with the other European powers. At the same time, the Russian educated elite was living a cultural, political and technological flourishing. This elite was divided into Slavophiles and Westernizers, according to their views on the path Russia should take in the future, and the social class they represented was called intelligentsia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME110082;Smuggle Tea to $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110082;After a failed attempt to cultivate tea in $COUNTRY$ in 1882 with seeds from India, Prince Mohammad Mirza known as "Kashef Al Saltaneh" who was born in Lahijan, imported Indian tea and started its cultivation in Lahijan. Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French laborer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavor only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

early_archaeology;Early Archaeology;;;;;;;;;;;;;
early_archaeology_desc;Archaeology is the study of human activity, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which includes artifacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record). Study of human antiquity date back in the days of the Renaissance, but in the 19th century, Archaeology evolved to a real science. Archaeologists began to investigate various areas around the world, with the study of ancient Aegean civilization being stimulated by the excavations of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy, and of Arthur Evans at Crete, whilst John Lloyd Stephens was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of Maya civilization throughout Central America. However, the methodologies employed by these archaeologists were highly flawed by the standards of the 20th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modern_archaeology;Modern Archaeology;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modern_archaeology_desc;Further advancements in archaeological field methodology arose in the late 19th century. One of the pioneering figures in this was Augustus Pitt Rivers, who meticulously excavated on Cranborne Chase in southern England, emphasizing that it was not only items of beauty or value that should be recorded but mundane items as well. He therefore helped to differentiate archaeology from antiquarianism. Flinders Petrie introduced systematic methodology in archaeology and preservation of artifacts. Archaeologists - once nothing more than tomb raiders - became reputable scientists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reclaim_anatolia_desc;The Purple Phoenix rises in the East! Having re-established itself amongst the empires of the West, the Byzantine Empire must work to recover its lands viciously taken from them by the Saracen and Slavic hordes over the centuries since its fall from its role as Hegemon of the East. Anatolia was the second jewel in the Byzantine Crown holding many of its finest cities and the majority of its landmass. However, since the early 15th Century, this proud land has been under the control of the Ottoman Empire. This trespass cannot stand! We shall liberate Anatolia for the Emperor and the Greco-Roman people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anatolia_retaken_title;Triumph for Anatolia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anatolia_retaken_desc;Anatolia is Roman once more! Byzantine forces have raised the Imperial Banner in every corner of Anatolia and its liberation from the Turkish cowards is nearly complete. However, centuries of Saracen domination has left this once proud Roman stronghold without strong connections to its once proud Greco-Roman heritage. This can hopefully be reversed in the coming years if we take steps to undo the "damage". Our first step should be to restore these lands their proper Greek names and encourage the rebuilding of old Greek settlements and fortresses. However, this move will likely draw the ire of the lands current Turkic and Caucasian people although they have done the same in the past to the Greek people, so we should not worry too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

balkan_themes_retaken_title;Triumph for the Balkans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
balkan_themes_retaken_desc;We have re-established ourselves once again at the edge of the Danube where the Eastern and Western Roman Empire once met. Of course, it has been many centuries since either of the once proud Roman states has held a firm grip on the region. Since then, many Slavic peoples have taken up residence in the area and fiercely resist any efforts to be controlled by any outside great empire, including ours. But, we have proven our resolve before and we will bring this unruly territory under our dominion. In keeping parity with our actions in Anatolia we shall rename these territories in an effort to Romanize them and start to foster a sense of unity in the territories. But, as many of the conquered people have no other land to call home this will greatly outrage them but fortune has always favored the bold, and we are no exception. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romanization_edict_title;Romanization Edict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romanization_edict_desc;Constantinople now stands as the undisputed master of the Asia Minor and the majority of the Balkans once again. However, we are a nation of many disparate nationalities, religions, and regional ties. Loyalty to the Basileus and to the Roman state is tenuous outside of Greek majority areas and there are worries in the Imperial Court that these areas could try to break away in order to reclaim their independence. There are steps that need to be taken in order to bring these cultures into the Roman fold and make them loyal citizens. Following the old model of Romanization, we need to first and foremost teach these new citizens the language of their Emperor: Greek. By issuing an edict mandating that primary schools and places of higher learning only operate in Greek and classical Latin we can ensure that our educated citizens will speak the imperial tongue and not the Slavic and Turkic languages of their ancestors and will go a long way over time in unifying the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liberate_balkan_themes_desc;Now that Anatolia is firmly in our grasp, it is time to turn our attention northwards to territories that have not been under Roman control for many centuries: The Balkan Themes. Largely lost to us after the 'Sklavenoi' incursion lead by the First Bulgarian Empire in the 7th Century, these Slavic peoples had been a grave rival to Roman hegemony, even threatening Constantinople at points throughout our history. Fortunately, the rising power of the Austrians and the previous occupation of much of this land by the Turkish invaders has degraded the Slavs' power in the region greatly, thus giving as the perfect opportunity to liberate it for Rome once more. However, this will cause great dissent amongst the Slavic populations already present in our domain so we must tread carefully as not to create an all-out insurrection amongst them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4888700;\n\nWhile the Russians have held Crimea for a long time, with our recent conquest of the land, the Tatar population has come to us with a proposal. They express that their culture was repressed under Russian rule, and if we grant them equal rights in our Empire, they will help us administrate the land. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4888702;\n\nLuristan has been reconquered from the Persians, and state is busy integrating it. However, this area is almost entirely home to the Kurdish. While we have centralized our own Kurdish territories, the addition of a new one may fan the flames of Kurdish nationalism. We can take steps to prevent this, but we will be seen as giving concessions to the Kurds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC60168169;\n\nPrior to the 1860s, Japan was divided into countless domains ruled by leaders called daimyo, who in turn answered to the military dictator known as the Shogun. The country would later face civil war over a crisis of leadership, with the Shogun contending with demands for the Japanese Emperor to be restored to power. Would you like to set beforehand who will unite Japan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSSIAHELPIRAN;\n\nAs Herat is a vital strategic position on the way from Central Asia or Iran to the twin Bolan and Khyber Passes, the veritable gates to India, the United Kindom has looked upon the Iranian advance on the previously more or less independent Principality of Herat with great concern. If Iran were to annex Herat, a Russian army aligned with the Shah could use it as a springboard to conquer India. The British government has therefore taken action and intervened on behalf of Herat. Realizing the impracticality of sending a force across Afghanistan, they have sent a naval expedition to the Persian Gulf and occupied Kharg Island, threatening all-out war should the Shah not back down. He has, however, trusting that we will back him against the British menace, refused the ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
