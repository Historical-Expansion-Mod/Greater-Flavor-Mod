The Act would cause the abolition of 143 borough seats in England and create 132 new counties in their place.

slavery_abolition_act_ENG_desc;The proposed Slavery Abolition Act sought the gradual abolition of slavery in all parts of the British Empire. Though in practical terms, only slaves below the age of six would be freed in the colonies, while slaves above the age of six would now be known as "apprentices," not all of whom would be free for several years. The only territories excluded from the Slavery Abolition Act would be the Honorable East India Company, Ceylon, and Saint Helena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1831_reform_riots_desc;\n\nA series of riots struck many British towns from London to Sherborne. Civil unrest has run amock in the streets due to the recently proposed Second Reform Bill failing to pass in Parliament. The civil disturbance got out of control in the towns of Nottingham, Derby, and Bristol. In Nottingham, rioting broke out after a public meeting had reverted to violence. Many private homes belonging to opponents of the reform were targeted by the rioters, leading to the Castle of Nottingham, home of the anti-reform Duke of Newcastle, being engulfed in flames alongside jails and a silk mill in Beeston. Bristol, in particular, has seen the biggest riots, lasting for three days and costing us 300,000 pounds worth of damage alongside 250 casualties. A trial has taken place, sentencing a total of 102 people. The court has sentenced twenty-two people to prison in Australia, forty-two to imprisonment, and another thirty-one to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;
poor_law_amendment_act_desc;\n\nEarl Grey and his Whig government passed the Poor Law Amendment Act of $YEAR$ or New Poor Law as it is widely known. It replaces the Poor Law of 1601 that was previously in place. It seeks to transfer poor rural workers to urbanized areas and protect the urban ratepayers from paying too much. Although, implementing the act in all of England is impossible, especially in the industrialized north, as it suffers from cyclical unemployment. Opposition towards the PLAA comes from all sectors of society, be it rural workers against the diet in workhouses, claiming they barely sustain the workers' health and nutrition, all the way to politicians and religious leaders. All this anger towards the PLAA has led to an amendment being made to the amendment act to remove most restrictions and measures previously implemented regarding workhouses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
brz_cabinda;\n\nIn 1827, the Brazilian Imperial Armada established the "Divisão Naval na Costa d'África" or "Divisão Naval do Leste" ("Naval division on the coast of Africa" and "Naval division of the east" respectively,) a naval base in the Angolan trade port of Cabinda, with the intent of inspecting the African slave trade towards Brazil and protecting Brazilian ships traveling the Southern Atlantic. \n\nDue to the recent Cisplatina war, the Brazilian Imperial Armada has been slowly demobilizing its flotilla in Africa to focus on South America. Should we return Cabinda to the Portuguese-Allied Kingdom of the Kongo and give up on a strategic port in Africa, or shall we maintain (and possibly expand) control in West Africa?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
