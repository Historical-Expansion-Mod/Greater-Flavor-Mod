EVTNAME5000001;Greek Revolutionaries make their Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000001;Ioannis Makrygiannis, the leader of the revolution of 1821 against the Ottomans, has begun to organise various rebel bands against our absolutist rule, declaring King Otto, our Bavarian monarch just as bad as the sultan in Constantinople. However, while the situation is rapidly deteriorating, it hasn't spiralled out of control just yet. Rejecting his demands might see the country erupt into all-out revolt. It all depends on our response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTA;We cannot risk rebellion, capitulate to his demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTB;His terms are outrageous and compromising, declare him an outlaw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTC;Make token conncessions that will surely starve out his movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME5000002;Constitutional Rebels Mobilize;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000002;Ioannis Makrygiannis and his rebels have had enough of the reactionary nature of King Otto and his Bavarian bureaucracy, his armies have begun to march towards $CAPITAL$. Hour by hour more parts of our army and peasantry are joining him and it seems that the situation is now completely untenable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000002OPTA;Call all those still loyal to defend his highness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME5000003;Revolutionary armies surround Royal Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000003;Despite our best attempts at dispersing rebel activity in recent years, it has all come to nought as rebel armies surround the old royal palace and demand that the king immediately be overthrown and a constituion be put in his place with universal suffrage for all Greek Men. We may however still have a chance if we rapidly call on anyone still loyal to the king, but, fighting these changes will cost our country dearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000003OPTA;We must accept our defeat, the rebels have won this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000003OPTB;No concessions, tell Steinstorf to rally anyone still loyal and fire at will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
