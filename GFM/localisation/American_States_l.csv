CSA_aoc_title;The New Articles of Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CSA_aoc_desc;§RGain 15 infamy§! While the Confederacy has prospered, the United States has fallen into despair and disarray. There are many that believe we should restore our ties to rest of the nation and remember our Revolutionary heritage from Southerners like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. It is the Confederacy's responsibility to restore the Founding Father's vision of a Union based on state's rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CSA_columbia_title;Give Columbia to Oregon Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CSA_columbia_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! Transfer control of the Columbia district to Oregon Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_NY_title;Incorporate New York;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_NY_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Amid the War of 1812, prominent politicians from across New England gathered in Hartford, Connecticut to express their anger towards an increasingly tyrannical Madison administration and protest its battle with Great Britain. The Hartford Convention was the starting point of the New England Independence Movement, but objections from the New York delegation deterred secessionist sentiments. It is due time to correct the mistakes made by New York in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_maritimes_conquest_title;Manifest Destiny in the Maritimes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_maritimes_conquest_desc;§RGain 7 infamy§! As New England continues to grow in power, so too must it grow in size. It is the destiny of New England to extend into Gulf of St. Lawrence. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia must under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_maritimes_purchase_title;Purchase the Maritimes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_maritimes_purchase_desc;While most uncivilized nations would simply claim territory then march off to war, New England has always valued the dignity in business and fair trade. Given our close ties, both culturally and economically, the British may bee willing to sell us their Maritimes Provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_lawrence_purchase_title;The St. Lawrence Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_lawrence_purchase_desc;Many in Boston agree that the natural borders of New England extend to St. Lawrence River, and it would advantageous to state to attempt to purchase all lands east of the river. Given New England's good ties with the British, we believe they are inclined to accept our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_lawrence_conquest_title;The Natural Borders of St. Lawrence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_lawrence_conquest_desc;§RGain 4 infamy§! The St. Lawrence River is important both for defense and for the trade that passes out into the gulf. Over past few years, New England has expanded greatly, and jingoist believe that the annexation of the territory east of the St. Lawrence river will complete the country's natural borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_french_title;The Acadian Acceptance Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_french_desc;While New England will always be, as the name implies, and an Anglo nation, we cannot ignore the large French speaking population that live within our borders. Rather than ignoring them, we should incorporate them into the fibers of our society while allowing them some cultural and linguistic privileges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_greater_title;Reclaim the Louisiana Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_greater_desc;§RGain 15 infamy§! The Sale of Louisiana in 1803 should be considered null and void as it failed to take into account the wishes of the citizens residing in the land. Louisiana must expand from out of the bayou and reclaim its rightful borders that extends along the great Mississippi River.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_buyout_title;The Second Louisiana Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_buyout_desc;The United States would never have originally agreed to sell back our rightful territory in the Mississippi Basin, but now that their Western frontier has collapsed, and we firmly hold onto the Louisiana Territory, we can bring the United States the negotiating table. We will of course offer them a fair price for their troubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CSA_ULA_friendship_title;The Treaty of St. Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CSA_ULA_friendship_desc;If there is any other nation that understands Louisiana's struggle for state's rights, it's the South. Against all odds, the Southern States won their independence from the Union and the people of Louisiana have warmly welcomed them into the world of nationhood. We should attempt to sign a treaty of friendship with the Confederacy and settle any border disputes we might have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_Dixie_title;Our Southern Brethren;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_Dixie_desc;Louisiana has a unique cultural identity that shines brightly in the New World. With that being said, the Cadien people are a minority in their own land. Our territory is scattered with American settlers, left overs of Thomas Jefferson's purchase. The majority of which are not happy about French rule. For Louisiana to survive, some of English population may need to be integrated. The so-called Dixie population are good candidate as they sympathize with Louisiana's struggle for independence and are no friends of the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_HAI_title;Annex Haiti;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_HAI_desc;§RGain 8 infamy§! As Louisiana continues to grow in power, $CAPITAL$ has begun to eye other territories that should be brought under our domain. The French speaking lands of Haiti would be a valuable and natural addition to Louisiana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_afro_title;Integrate the Afro Français Population;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ULA_afro_desc;Several reformers in the Louisianan government have suggested extended some political rights to the native population of Haiti. Louisiana is surrounded by Anglos on all sides, so it would not hurt to grow its French speaking population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5985065;\n\nAfter years of strife and civil wars, the Confederacy has tamed the flames of disorder that have torn through territory of the former United States. Looking the past for inspiration, the Confederate States have revived the once discarded Article of Confederation, decentralized predecessor to Constitution. This New Articles of Confederation will reorganize the former United States into autonomous regional unions that will respect the rights of states. To symbolize the South accepting the lineage of the founding fathers, the Confederacy has reallocated the capital to the recently renamed city of Washington-Davis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8297686;\n\nNew England has approached us asking to purchase the Maritimes territories. Even our close relationship with the people of New England, the selling of the Maritimes could further bolster our influence in the region while also providing a good sum of cash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1314529;\n\nThe British have agreed to sell us the Maritimes. Alongside the exchange of considerable amount of money, the British are transferring to us administration of the region on the condition that we respect the rights of Canadians currently residing in the territory. Truly this has been a good day for business in Boston.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6165914;\n\nThe British have refused to sell us the Maritimes. It seems money cannot get New England everything. What a disastrous day for business in Boston.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9510843;\n\nAfter the successful purchase of the Maritimes, New England is once again attempting to purchase new land. Boston hopes to incorporate all lands east of the St. Lawrence River. Considering the large French speaking population that resides in these areas, it certainly would be a burden off our shoulders for them to be a nuisance to someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8916799;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to sell us all lands east of the St. Lawrence river. The borders of New England continue to grow, and business continue to boom. Another victory for Brother Jonathan in Boston and his deep pockets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9652809;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sell us all lands east of the St. Lawrence river. New England might need to seize the land by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7493599;\n\nWhile most of upstate New York has welcomed New England as liberators and cultural brothers, the bustling metropolis of New York City has rejected any attempts at integration. Rivalry between New York City and Boston can be traced back to times before the American War for Independence, and the recent annexation has resulted in an eruption of riots across the dirty and overcrowded streets of the Empire City. For now, New England rule has been thoroughly rejected and it will take time to integrate the five boroughs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4489019;\n\nAfter an embarrassing defeat at the hands our former territory of Louisiana, our great country has been split in half. The western states believe the East cannot guarantee their safety and as such they have declared their independence. Unable to enforce our rule, we must accept our loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1388079;\n\nFor all the headache the Louisianans have caused us, they have decided to add insult to injury by offering to formally purchase all land originally sold to us by Napoleon and compensate us for additional land seized in the Oregon Country. Given our disastrous state, the United States has no choice but accept this offer with our tales between our legs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1793144;\n\nNow that the South is independent, we must quickly look for friends and the people of Louisiana have extended an olive branch. While we both share a history of struggling against the United States, to accept their invitation to St. Louis would recognize their rule of lands claimed by the Confederacy. Although friendship might be a better alternative to conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9149119;\n\nThe Confederate delegation has accepted our invitation to St. Louis and have agreed to ratify a treaty of mutual support and friendship. Along with the recognition Louisianan claims over the lands of the Mississippi River Basin, the Treaty of St. Louis has resulted in the creation of an alliance between the two southern nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8224916;\n\nThe Confederacy has refused to accept our invitation to St. Louis. Relations between Louisiana and the Confederacy will sour after this break down in negotiations. We can only hope the $FROMCOUNTRY$ will not be foolish enough to invade across the Mississippi River to enforce territorial claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6051288;\n\nAfter returning from London, the Confederate ambassador to the United Kingdom published a collection of essays titled "An Imperial Confederacy." Throughout his writings, he described the regality and honor of the English royal family. As an avid convert to monarchism, the former ambassador argued for the establishment of a chivalrous monarchy that the good people of South may look up to for inspiration and guidance. His essays have become extremely popular with the more conservative elements of the Confederacy, and a group of Senators in $CAPITAL$ have proposed a bill that would amend the constitution to allow for a constitutional monarchy. Some believe a monarchy could help further develop a Confederate cultural identity that is unique from our Yankee neighbors. Nevertheless, many believe that the South does not need a king and a Confederate monarchy would disgrace the memory of great Southerners like George Washington and Jefferson Davis who fought against such tyrants..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8629614;\n\nWhen the Confederate States of America achieved its independence from the United States, the country agreed to abide by the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves and to ban the transatlantic slave trade. Despite these agreements, some wealthy slaveholders have recently been secretly importing slaves from Africa, believing them to be of superior stock as well as a prestigious addition to their plantation. While slavery is legal, the importation of slaves is not. Some fear international condemnation if the government does not take action to tighten enforcement against this growing trend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
