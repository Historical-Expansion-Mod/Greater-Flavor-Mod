maldives_protectorate_title;The Maldives Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
maldives_protectorate_desc;Located southwest of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives are an archipelago made up of over a thousand islands. They are ruled by the Huraa dynasty, who have been Sultans since 1744. The archipelago was briefly colonized by the Dutch, before a local revolt with British backing forced them to withdraw. Since then, the Maldives have been independent and largely neutral. It is clear, however, that the Sultan has no way of defending the islands from foreign powers, a possibility which is becoming more likely with the colonization of Africa, South and Southeast Asia progressing ever more rapidly. We should therefore propose a treaty of protection to the Sultan, making him give up his sovereignty in matters of foreign policy but allowing him continued self-government. He will certainly accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

apoc_title;Found the Anglo-Persian Oil Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apoc_desc;The English Anglo-Persian Oil Company was the first company to extract petroleum from Iran. In 1901 William Knox D'Arcy negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din: he would assume exclusive rights to prospect for 60 years in a vast tract of territory and in exchange the Shah received 20,000 pounds, an equal amount in shares, and a promise of future profits. In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000 pounds into their Persian venture and found no oi, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home." The geologist Geroge Bernard Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after on May 26, 1908.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

encourage_italian_aircraft_desc;In the years after the Great War, Italy had taken an uncommon interest in aviation, which is even more remarkable because of its lacking industrial capacity. Nevertheless, the unconquered territories of the sky were a field in which Italy - in relation to other countries with much larger resources - was a leading nation. High esteem by the people and an excessive propaganda formed some of the best pilots of that time, like Italo Balbo. Italian airplanes and seaplanes were famous for establishing records, which are still unbeaten. Well, let the show begin - maybe our Minister of Aviation will be even parodied by the Marx Brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_pakistan2_title;Form Pakistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_pakistan2_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered  the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was "a complete social order which affects all the activities in life" and "where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded". To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

covering_of_the_senne_desc;By the second half of the 19th century, the Senne had become a serious health hazard and was filled with pollution, garbage and decaying organic matter. It flooded frequently, inundating the lower town and the working class neighborhoods which surrounded it. Numerous proposals were made to remedy this problem, and in 1865, the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach, selected a design by architect LÈon Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to its cost and the need for expropriation and demolition of working-class neighborhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an embezzlement scandal. This delayed the project, but it was still completed in 1871.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
