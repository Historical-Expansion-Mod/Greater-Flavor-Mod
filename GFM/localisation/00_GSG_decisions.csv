embrace_the_boer_title;Make Amends with the Boer;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Boer farmers, paying compensation, abolishing Company rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Boers accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This would assist the transformation of Russia from a backward agricultural economy into a modern industrial and capitalist economy. More urgently, Alexander agreed to other liberalizations of Russian society. Among these were the creation of representative bodies called zemstva, in effect a form of local government in villages and provinces, given authority to dispense education, charitable relief and other services.

Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others.

abolish_los_fueros_desc;The relentless centralizing drive of the Spanish Crown led, after the end of the First Carlist War, to the reduction of the Basque institutional and legal system (called Fueros), but it was only after the last Carlist War that it was virtually wiped out. After the war, a new Spanish constitution was drawn up in order to establish a unitarian and central administration in Spain cut out according to a Spanish-Castilian pattern. Navarre was affected, but for the moment it was spared from further curtailments due to their 1841 "Compromise Act" (Ley Paccionada) that turned officially the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Navarre into another province of Spain. The Basques were forced to enroll in the Spanish military on an individual basis, and not in separate groups or corps, despite the fact that many Basques could hardly articulate a pair of phrases in Spanish, exposing them at best to stressful experiences. These changes allowed Spain to turn in a modern unified country, shaking off the last bits of the Ancien RÈgime, the first step to end the regionalism driving the forces behind the Carlists and Christinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000 pounds into their Persian venture and found no oi, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home." The geologist Geroge Bernard Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after on May 26, 1908.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

encourage_italian_aircraft_desc;In the years after the Great War, Italy had taken an uncommon interest in aviation, which is even more remarkeable because of its lacking industrial capacity. Nevertheless, the unconquered territories of the sky were a field in which Italy - in relation to other countries with much larger ressources - was a leading nation. High esteem by the people and an excessive propaganda formed some of the best pilots of that time, like Italo Balbo. Italian airplanes and seaplanes were famous for establishing records, which are still unbeaten. Well, let the show begin - maybe our Minister of Aviation will be even parodied by the Marx Brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was "a complete social order which affects all the activities in life" and "where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded".

To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was "a complete social order which affects all the activities in life" and "where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded". To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

annex_eastern_rumelia_desc;The Congress of Berlin left Bulgaria divided into two sections: the area north of the Balkan Mountains and Sofia became an autonomous principality, Eastern Rumelia between the Balkan and Rhodope Mountains gained semi-autonomous status with an Ottoman appointed Christian governor. Although Bulgaria was technically under the suzerainty of the Sublime Porte, this was a legal fiction that Bulgaria only acknowledged in a formal way and acted largely as a de facto independent state. In $YEAR$, a rebellion and coup in Eastern Rumelia, led by Bulgarians, saw the people proclaim a union with the state of Bulgaria, in violation of the Berlin Treaty. By putting the annexation into effect, we can incorporate this land and solidify our independent status, at the risk of angering the Great Powers and the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

covering_of_the_senne_desc;By the second half of the 19th century, the Senne had become a serious health hazard and was filled with pollution, garbage and decaying organic matter. It flooded frequently, inundating the lower town and the working class neighbourhoods which surrounded it. Numerous proposals were made to remedy this problem, and in 1865, the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach, selected a design by architect LÈon Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to its cost and the need for expropriation and demolition of working-class neighbourhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an embezzlement scandal. This delayed the project, but it was still completed in 1871.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
