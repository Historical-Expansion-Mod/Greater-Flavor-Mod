AUSTINFOUNDING;The Founding of Austin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUSTINFOUNDINGDESC;\n\nA small pioneer settlement situated on the Colorado River in central Texas has been chosen as the republic's seventh and final capital. Incorporated under the name Waterloo, the town has been renamed Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NINKODEATH;The Death of Emperor Ninko;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NINKODEATH2;\n\nEmperor Ninko, the 120th Emperor of Japan, has passed away. Ninko's reign has spanned from 1817 to 1846, seeing further deterioration of the power of the ruling Shogun. Disasters, including famine, combined with corruption and increasing Western interference, have helped to erode public trust in the bakufu government. It is hard to say what role, if any, the Emperor had in the turmoil which occurred during his reign, as Japan is ruled by the shogun and an emperor's role is primarily ceremonial. He has been enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, Nochi no Tsukinowa no Higashiyama no misasagi. Prince Osahito, Emperor Ninko's fourth son, has now assumed the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH;The Death of Francis I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH2;\n\nBorn in 1777, Francis I, who ascended to the throne in 1825, has passed away today at the age of 53. He pursued a course of conservatism during his reign. He only rarely took part in the government, which he left in the hands of his favorites and police officials. Thus, the king lived with his mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of assassination. During his reign, the only revolutionary movements to erupt were the Cilento Riots of 1828. After a lengthy period of illness, King Francis entered a period of delirium before finally passing away. In his final moments, plagued by hallucinations of a revolution, he hysterically cried out: "What are these voices? The people want a constitution? Give it to them!" He is succeeded by his son to his second wife, Ferdinand II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH;The Death of Charles Felix;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH2;\n\nBorn in 1765 and crowned King of Sardinia in 1821, Charles Felix has passed away today at the age of 66. He was the last male-line member of the House of Savoy, leaving the throne to his distant cousin Charles Albert of Savoy-Carignano, regent of Sardinia. His rule began with the abdication of his father, Victor Emmanuel I to Liberal Revolutionaries in 1821. He was regarded as a true reactionary, and was rarely present in Turin as king, having no particular affection for the Turinese due to the prior revolution. He tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior, reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterized by Massimo d'Azeglio, a prominent statesman, as "a despotism full of straight and honest intentions but its representatives and arbiters were four old chamberlains, four old maids of honor, with a hive of friars, priests, monks, and jesuits.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH;The Death of Emperor Mutsuhito;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH2;\n\nEmperor Mutsuhito, now known by his posthumous name Meiji, has died today after a period of publicized suffering. With the death of the Mikado of Japan, the Meiji Era closes, -- a period which stands out in the long history of Japan as the most illustrious and most enlightened and represents an evolution and progress unequalled in a similar time in the history of any other nation. It has witnessed the transformation of Japan from a hermit island empire, under provincial feudal rule, to a world power of the first class. It has been an era of glorious victories, and, above all, of unparalleled advancement. The death of His Majesty Mutsuhito, in the 60th year of his life and the 44th year of his reign, will doubtless have a very far reaching effect upon the peoples and politics of Asia if not upon those of the entire world. For it was during his august reign that Japan not only opened her gates to the peoples and commerce of the world, but fairly entered into the comity of nations. The late Mutsuhito will be succeeded to the throne by his son Yoshihito, his Majesty the new Emperor, who was married in 1900 to the Princess Sadako and has a son and heir, the Prince Hirohito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELBEFLOOD1845;\n\nA severe winter hitting the country has caused an ice dam to form on the river Elbe, trapping the water behind it. A sudden thaw, which resulted in heavy snow melting in the German low mountain ranges and the rapid break-up of the frozen Elbe, has triggered the flood. When the dam finally gave way to the mass of water, it took a substantial part of the dike flanking the river with it. The water has now flooded into the valley along the river, destroying many homes and farms from northern Bohemia to Anhalt in the process. The city of Dresden has been hit particularly hard by the flooding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
propagandaphi;\n\nA movement has recently sprung up in the Philippines encompassing the activities of a group of Filipinos who call for political reforms in their lands that we control, producing books, leaflets, and newspaper articles to educate others about their goals and supposed issues they are trying to solve. The Propagandists' aims include representation in the parliment, secularization of the clergy, the guarantee of basic civil freedoms, The abolishment of labor services and the forced sale of local products to the government, and legal equality for the native Filipinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ast_capital_title;The Capital Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ast_capital_desc;\n\nA heated debate has sprung up in parliment regarding potential locations of the capital of Australia. Due to the recent gold rush in Victoria, Melbourne is now Australia's largest city and a suitable place for the capital. However Sydney, rival city to Melbourne, is Australia's oldest, and so also has a justifiable claim to host the new nation's Federal polity. To select one city would certainly anger the populace in the other as the Sydney–Melbourne rivalry is such that neither city would never agree to the other one becoming the capital. As such, a political compromise has also been suggested: A new capital, Canberra, is to be built somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne in the larger state of New South Wales, so long as it was at least 160km from Sydney. This option would help prevent a rise in tensions in either city at the cost of developing a new city from the ground up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CASPIAN1;\n\nAs our control over the nothern coast solidifies, we are able to project more and more power southwards down the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea. While the land is relatively desolate comparted to the southern and western coast, mainly consisting of dry deserts in the north and mountains in the south populated by nomadic Turkmen and Kazakhs, a small foothold in the region will be useful in our attempt to increase our regional power projection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AKMECHETLOSS;\n\nWith our control over the city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan lost, it has become impossible for us to supply and maintain our line of forts along the Syr-Darya river, including the key fortress of Ak-Mechet. The territory now rests in the hands of the local Kazakh nomads belonging to the Middle Jüz. We can only hope this turn of events is only a temporary set-back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AKMECHETGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Kokand having lost the key city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan, they can no longer defend it. We will therefore take it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERVLOSS;\n\nWith our connection to the Merv oasis lost, it has become impossible for us to supply and defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERVGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Khiva having lost connection to the oasis city of Merv, they can no longer defend it. We will therefore take it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOZAQLOSS;\n\nWith our connection to the Sozaq lost, it has become impossible for us to supply and defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOZAQGAIN;\n\nWith the Senior Kazakhs having lost connection to Sozq, they can no longer defend it. We will therefore take it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Kokand busy dealing with a massive Kyrgyz revolt to their north-east, they have become unable to defend their holdings along the Shu and Syr Darya Rivers, including the our former capital of Turkistan. Kenesary, with the help of the his two brother-Khans and their younger cousin, Aziz id-Din Bahadur, son of Nauryzbai Bahadur, has gathered a large troop of well-trained Kazakhs to capture these key fortresses along the Syr Darya in the name of bolstering our forces against the Russian menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUGAIN2;\n\nLike vultures, they have decended on us! As we deal with war to our north and south, a large troop of Kazakhs led by Kenesary Khan and his generals have swiftly taken our lands surrounding the Syr Darya and Shu Rivers up to the important city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan. \n\nThis loss is yet another stain on the young Madali Khan's legacy and failing to meet these Kazakh invaders in battle would further exacerbate this, but perhaps it would be wiser to focus our limited resources on ending our current conflicts instead of starting new ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHIVAMERVINVASION;\n\nThe Turkmen of the Karakum Desert have historically bent the knee to the Khivan Khan, paying taxes in the form of Zakat and tribute. Recently, our grip over the Turkmen has loosed and it falls to Allah Quli Khan to reestablish Khivan authority in the region, focusing on the Merv Oasis in the southeast, and the Sariq Turkmens located there, and the frontier lands of Sarakhs bordering the Persians, along with the Akhal Turkmen who reside there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHIVAMERVINVASIONTKM;\n\nThe Khan of Khiva, Allah Quli Khan, in his infinite greed and foolishness has levied a mighty army and marches it towards Sarakhs, having already taken the Merv Oasis and its neighbouring lands. It falls to us, the Teke Tribe, to resist this mad Khan and his foolhardy attempt to expand his influence in our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS1;\n\nIn an effort to make up for his defeats in the Second Russo-Persians War and bolster his claim to the throne, Abbas Mirza received the governorship of Khorasan and was sent there to solidify Qajar rule over the area, taking control of the rebellious towns of Khabushan, Torbat-e Heydarieh, and Sarakhs, commiting a great massacre against the Turkmen and allowing us to properly push our claims over southern Turkmenia.\nAbbas Mirza has also sent an ultimatum to Kamran Mirza Durrani, the Durrani ruler of Herat: either have the name of the Shah mentioned on coin engravings and Friday prayers, pay taxes, and release hostages, accepting vassalage under the Guarded Domains of Iran, or relinquish Herat and appear at the Iranian court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS2;\n\nFollowing our victory over the Teke Turkmen in the south, a Persian army, led by the Qajar heir-apparent Abbas Mirza, has used the opportunity to swiftly seize the border city of Sarakhs! Shall we launch a counter invasion of the territory and punish the Persians for their transgression? While Sarakhs is a notable settlment in northern Khorasan, it lays at the edge of our southern frontier and may not be worth going to war against the Persians over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS3;\n\nIn retaliation to our seizure of Sarakhs, Allah Quli Khan has launched a large-scale invasion of our northern border. This has escalated what should have been a minor shifting of the border into a larger conflict. We must use this opportunity to push our claims over the Merv Oasis and establish a distant frontier from the Khorasani heartland. May Allah grant us certain victory against the Khivan Horde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS4;\n\nWe are victorious over the weak Qajar Dynasty. The remaining lands in Northern Khorasan and the Turkmen Sahra are ours for the taking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833HERATSIEGE1;\n\nHerat, a frontier vassalage barely under Iranian control, is seen by the Qajar dynasty as an integral part of the Guarded Domains of Iran. In late 1831, the Iranian crown prince Abbas Mirza received the governorship of Khorasan, which amongst other things led to growing hostilities with Kamran Mirza Durrani, Emir of Herat. The latter has received an ultimatum from Abbas Mirza with two options: either have the name of the Iranian Shah mentioned on coin engravings and Friday prayers, pay taxes, and release hostages recently captured in Khorasan, or relinquish Herat and appear at the Iranian court. We may either submit under Iranian rule or, more cleverly, send a gift of 15,000 tomans worth of gold coins to the crown prince in exchange for his acceptance of our rightful sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833HERATSIEGE2;\n\nKamran Mirza of Herat has foolishly declined our generous offer of vassalage and instead attempts to bribe us with a sum of 15,000 Toman in gold coins, cautioning Abbas Mirza that seeking more would require facing war. We can accept this offer in exchange for their continued independence, or we can march our armies to Herat itself and enforce our original terms on the Emir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833HERATSIEGE3;\n\nAbbas Mirza's irrevocable losses in the wars against Russia affected him severely and his health began to suffer. As a result of this, he has died today aged 44 while on military maneuvers in the Greater Khorasan region. Abbas was a noted military commander and reformer of the armed forces, characterized as an intelligent prince, possessing some literary taste, and is noteworthy on account of the comparative simplicity of his life.\nWith the loss of his strategic genius and status as the heir to the throne, his son Mohammad Mirza now stands to inherit throne, but courtly scheming threatens to undermine his position if he does not abandon the siege at Herat and make haste for Tehran. In addition, Grand Vizier Yar Mohammad Khan of Herat has negotiated a deal between us and the Emir of Herat in which Kamran Mirza is required to send one of his sons as a hostage, have the name of the Iranian Shah mentioned on coin engravings and Friday prayers, and provide 15,000 toman and 50 rolls of cashmere wool as a "gift".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FATHALISHAHDEATH;\n\nThe Shah has died today aged 63. Famous for his long beard, his wasp-like waist and his progeny. He is said to have bedded well over 1000 women and is survived by fifty-seven sons and forty-six daughters, along with 296 grandsons and 292 granddaughters. Fath-Ali was a vigorous, manly and highly intelligent man, but succumbed to decadence, indolence and avarice later in life. He is succeeded by the late Abbas Mirza's son Mohammad Mirza, now Mohammad Shah Qajar.\nIn the east, the unruly Emir of Herat has refused to accept Mohammad Shah's rule over the Emirate and once again breaks free from our grasp. Unfortunately, post-succession turmoil prevents Mohammad Shah from acting against the Herati for now, but it wont be long before Iranian flags fly over Herat once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOSSEINALIMIRZA1;\n\nDespite his clear status as heir apparent after the death of his father, Abbas Mirza, there are many who wish to defy Mohammad Shah and seize the trone for themselves. Ali Mirza Zel-ol-Soltan, Mohammad Shah's uncle in Tehran, has used Mohammad Shah's absence in the capital to proclaim himself Shah. Mohammad Shah in response, under Russian and British diplomatic protection and accompanied by a British military mission from India, set off to Tehran where Ali Mirza promptly surrenders.\nThe most serious dynastic challenge has come from Hossein Ali Mirza Farmanfarma, Governor of Fars, who has proclaimed himself Shah at Shiraz and is joined by his brother Hasan Ali Mirza Shoja al-Saltaneh. Although he lacks support both with the tribal Khans, who had once lost their power to him, and the local populace due to Hossein Ali's reputation as a cruel and ruthless ruler, he has managed to send an army under the command of his brother towards Isfahan, which has been successfully captured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOSSEINALIMIRZA2;\n\nWith Hossein Ali Mirza's army crushed by a combined army of loyalists lead by Manuchehr Khan Mo'tamed ad-Dowleh and a British force under the command of Lindesay-Bethune, and Isfahan retaken, the revolt in Fars has been quelled and the rebellious brothers have been captured and sent to Tehran. Hossein Ali Mirza has died of cholera while his brother is blinded and sent to Ardabil. Three of Farmanfarma's sons have escaped, fleeing to England under British protection. The loyalist remains of the Governor of Fars' army has returned to service under the Shah.\nMohmammad Shah has successfully defended his throne against these would-be usurpers and cemented himself as the rightful Shahanshah of Iran! \n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN1;\n\nKasim Sultan, son of the last Kazakh Khan, Ablai Khan, has for over half a decade protested against our expansion into the Kazakh Steppe. In 1825, he lodged multiple protests with the various Governors of our frontier, drawing attention to the construction of fortifications in their domain, recalling the agreements between his father and Russia regarding the establishment of a formal border between our peoples. These requests were all rejected, marking the beginning of a now 7 year long series of raids on our frontier settlements and caravans.\nSarzhan Kasimov, son of Kasim, follows his father in rebellion and has conducted many campaigns against the local Cossacks, stealing thousands of guns and horses and killing many Cossacks. While his raidings haven't yet proven difficult to repel, there are whispers of a joint invasion of the Kushbeg of Tashkent, Lord-General of the Kokand Khanate, in order to permanently expel us from the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN2;\n\nRecently, a Kazakh noble by the name of Sarzhan Qasymuly has approached us with an interesting offer:\n\n He proposes joint invasion of the Middle Jüz in order to expell all Russian influence in the area. In the past decade, Sarzhan and his family have been conducting raids on Russian garrisons and caravans, but have not been successful in pushing the Russians out of the Kazakh Steppe. If we agree to his offer and drive out the Russians, not only will our influence in the wild north be cemented, giving us a powerful bulwark against Russian intervention in the region, but we may also be able to use this influence to gain a permanent foothold over the Syr Darya delta, giving us access to the bounties of the Aral Sea. Defeating the Russians may be be a monumental task, §Bbut there is little threat they can pose to us even if we aren't successful.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN3;\n\nA great army comprising Kazakhs lead by Sarzhan Qasymuly and Kokandi soldiers lead by the Kushbeg of Tashkent has marched into our lands in order to expel the Russians and exert their own influence over the tribes of the Middle Jüz. They have swiftly attacked and taken the key fortresses of Sozaq and Taraz south of the Chu river and now head north to take the fight straight to the Russians. We can only hope the Russians and their Cossack garrisons are prepared to fend off this great army!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN4;\n\nWith our great victory over the Kazakhs assisted by the perfidious Russians, we have managed to install Sarzhan Qasymuly as a puppet Khan of the Middle Jüz clans. With our northern border stable for the time being, we are able to once again extend our influence down the Syr Darya Delta and finally wrest control over the eastern Aral Sea coast from the local Kazakh and Karakalpaks. A great day for the Khanate of Kokand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY1;\n\nThroughout the past century, our northern neighbour has continued their efforts in increasing their influence over our lands. As the Russian Empire penetrate deeper and deeper into Kazakh lands, Kenesary Qasymuly, grandson of Ablai Khan and brother of the late Sarzhan Qasymuly, and notable detractor of the Russians, has proven himself equal to his brother in fighting back against the Russians, gathering many local nobles of the Junior and Middle Jüz, formalizing a mutual pact in opposition to the Russians and their expansion south. Kenesary's rise to power is sure to once again upset the Russian-favouring status-quo. May this be the beginning of a new Kazakh golden age!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY2;\n\nThe Kazakh people have long since held a position of protectorate of the Russian Empire, yet any actual control over the Kazakh Steppes has proven difficult to come by. A century's worth of fortification construction and pacification has led to only the edges of these lands falling into line as the interior continues to be governed by local clans and tribes. And yet, our accelerating pacification of the Steppes, largely due in part to our superior technology and tactics, have startled the local populace enough for them to rally around the leadership of a Kenesary Kasimov, grandson of the last Kazakh Khan, Ablai Khan, and brother of the dead and defeated Sarzhan Kasimov. His presence has disrupted our nominal overlordship over the Kazakhs and §RIs certain to escalate into all-out war in the coming years...§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY3;\n\nKenesary's success in the recent campaign against the Khanate of Kokand has dramatically boosted his popularity among the tribes of the Kazakh steppe. In response to his victory, a Kurultay has been convened and Kenesary Khan has been elected as the Khan of All-Kazakhs, a title not in use since the death of Ablai Khan, Kenesary's grandfather, 40 years ago. The three Jüz are finally reunited after all this time and a horde of twenty thousand has been levied to resist the Russians to the north and the Uzbeks to the south. The Khanate must not fall, the Khanate will not fall! \n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY4;\n\nThe upstart Kenesary Kasimov has united the disparate Kazakh clans and reunited the thought-to-be-dead Kazakh Khanate. Kenesary Khan's coronation has lit a fire under our Kazakh subjects as he sets his sights on the our lands in Central Asia. It is unknown if he will continue with the small-scale assaults and caravan raids as he has done up until now, but it is in our best interest to mobilize a force on our borders in anticipation of any movement from his horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY5;\n\nThe upstart Kenesary Kasimov, brother of Sarzhan Kasimov, has made his first move against us. Kenesary's military operations began in the spring with the siege of Akmolinsk fortress. The garrison commander of the fortress, Ivan Karbyshev, and the Senior Sultan of the Akmolinsk district, Konyrkulzha Kudaymendin barely managed to escape the burned fortress. The rebel army next marched to Turgay where they took the fortess of Kush-Murun where Kenesary now stays at, planning to extend the revolt to the lands of the Junior Jüz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY6;\n\nAkmolinsk Prikaz was well protected. Deep ditches were dug in the district, all nearby approaches were blocked. The Akmolinsk Prikaz was guarded by the troops of the Russian puppet Konurkuldzha Kudaimendin and the garrison of the fortress, led by the Ivan Karbyshev. The offensive of Kenesary's troops began at dawn. Kazakh archers fired at the fortress with bows, attaching flammable tarred rags to the arrowheads. Numerous fires broke out in the fortress. At that moment, when part of the garrison rushed to fight the fire, one of the detachments of Kenesary, despite the heavy fire, broke the enemy resistance and penetrated the fortification. \nThe next day, the ruined fortress was still on fire, its destruction, now clearly visible in the daylight. \nKenesary Khan's attack on the Russian fortress of Akmolinsk has been successful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY7;\n\nThe situation in the Kazakh steppe has taken a turn for the worse. Kenesary Kasimov, now Kenesary Khan is no longer content in merely raiding border forts and harrassing caravans but has raised a host of over twenty thousand men and plans to march through our lands, capturing and sacking whatever settlement of ours he and his horde can find. We cannot continue to allow his to act as freely as he has up until now, lest he continue to gain legitimacy among his peers and truly threaten our hold over the region. Thankfully, it seems not everything is in Kenesary Khan's favour; Many of the tribes in the south and east, while nominally serving him, refuse to muster arms against us and even among the tribes who do fight along side him do not do so full-heartedly, making it easy to tempt their betrayal. In addition, Ormon Khan of the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate to the Kazakhs' south eyes Kazakh lands in the Zhetysu basin and seems willing to assist us in putting down this rebellion. It is time for us to crush this pretender Khan and reestablish our rightful dominion over the Kazakhs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY8;\n\nThe time has come! We can no longer continue with merely pestering the Russian frontiers with small raids and skirmishes. Kenesary Khan has levied a horde of over twenty thousand horsemen from all clans and tribes and to deal a decisive blow to the Russian menace and liberate the remaining Kazakhs still under their boot. Victory certainly will not come easy as The majority of the tribes of the Senior Jüz still refuse to come into direct conflict with the Russian. §RThe eastern Nayman tribe in Lopsin have also refused to fight§!, clinging to the Qing Empire in a cowardly attempt to avoid meeting the Russians in battle. To make things worse, Ormon Khan of the reemergent Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate has begun to harrass our people in the south, aiming to conquer lands in the Zhetysu basin. Even so, we must not give in to despair nor lie down without a fight. Victory for Kenesary Khan! Victory for the Kazakh Khanate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY9;\n\nWhile Kenesary Khan may nominally be Khan of All-Kazakhs, the majority of the tribes of the Senior Jüz do not follow him to battle. Little has changed for the average nomad in the Zhetysu basin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY10;\n\nWe have emerged victorious! Kenesary Khan has defied the odds and brought defeat to the Russian Empire. The liberation of all Kazakhs from Orda to Alma-Ata has been achieved as Russian forces have been push out of our lands. Kenesary Khan's legitimacy and dominance is now unquestioned and the various tribes and clans of the three Jüz who still held Russian sympathies have fallen in line and now answer only to the Shah-i Turan. While this does not spell the end for future Russian interference in Central Asia, this defeat is sure to be a setback large enough to allow us to focus on our enemies to the south and east. Sarhan Qasymuly has been avenged! Ablai Khan looks down to us with pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY11;\n\nThe conflict between Kenesary Khan of the Kazakhs and the Russian Empire has concluded with the crushing defeat of the Kazakh forces. Russian troop have recently besieged and captured their capital city in Turkistan, yet have not established any form of a permanent garrison, implying either a lack of desire or inability to hold the territory this far south. With the Kazakh tribes in disarray and the Russian returning north, this is the perfect opportunity to establish a hold over the Syr Darya and the various fortresses and cities which were conquered by Kenesary Khan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY12;\n\nThe impossible has happened! Even in the face of the overwhealming might of the Russian Empire, even after the death of Kenesary Khan, the great Khan of All-Kazakhs, we have managed to emerge victorious against our enemy. Kenesary's remaining generals managed to stabilize the collapsing horde long enough to push back the Russian army and secure total victory over the Russians, liberating all of our rightful lands to our north and west. Now we must see whether we are able to recover from the death of our Khan and elect a new Khan of All-Kazakhs or if we will once again succumb to infighting amongst ourselves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY13;\n\nIt was too good to be true... \n\nDespite our miraculous victory over the Russian Empire, without a leader, the now scattered and aimless Kazakh tribes have once again divided themselves along clan lines. Only time will tell if another Khan of All-Kazakhs will emerge from our disunified peoples, and raise the Kazakh banner across the steppe once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY14;\n\nWith the future of the Kazakh steppe uncertain, where might the winds of fortune for our people blow next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY15;\n\nWith the death of Kenesary Khan and our victory over Kazakh Khanate assured, the lands of the Middle and Junior Jüz are now properly destroyed and incorporated into our Empire as it should have been since we decreed their dissolution in 1824. While some of the territories Kenesary Khan had conquered from the Kokand Khanate has fallen back into their hands, we are now the sole masters over the Kazakh Steppe proper. Our relation with the Senior Jüz Kazakhs, who did not participate in the rebellion, has also returned to normal §Band we have been hearing talks of their willing annexation into our Empire§W; it remains to be seen if these talks lead to anything greater, though. §BPerhaps some increased presence and influence in the region may tip the scales in our favour§W. /nThe pacification of the Kazakh Steppe has been achieved for the foreseeable future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UCAJY;\n\nWith our conquests in Central Asia reaching its zenith, we are now the undisputed masters of even the most uninhabited portions of the Kara-Kum desert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARYKASIMOV;\n\nKenesary Kasimov has long been a thorn in our side. Son of Kasim Sultan and brother of Sarzhan Kasimov, he ascended to the throne of the Kazakh Khanate in 1841. He became infamous in 1837 after his forces captured and razed the fortress of Akmolinsk to the ground. He has continually raided caravans, besieged forts, and evaded attempts at capturing him. Additionally, he waged war on the Khanate of Kokand to the South of the Khanate, a sort of retreat from our advance in the North. Now, he has finally met is fate - at the hands of Kokand. Despite being whittled down to a force of but 500 men, he insisted on fighting on, never losing hope for an independent Kazakhstan. His death, the result of the betrayal of his forces' location by the Kyrgyz Ormon Khan, renders Kazakh Khanate a snake without a head: With the last Khan dead, the Kazakhs are divided and leaderless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARYDEATH;\n\nKenesary Kasimov has been killed! Despite his skill and bravery in the battlefield, Russian forces with their advanced weapons and tactics have reduced our numbers to a meager fraction of what it once was. It had been decided to retreat our remaining forces to the mountainous region near Lake Balkhash to continue the struggle against the Russians in more favourable terrain when our troops were ambushed and captured by a Kyrgyz force who had defected to the Russians, their location having been given away by the Kyrgyz Ormon Khan. After their capture, Kenesary Khan, along with Nauryzbai were swiftly executed. With the Khan dead, we are divided and leaderless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AKMECHET1;\n\n"Ak-Mechet is already taken, although you are inside it, and you cannot fail to perceive that without losing any of my men, I am in a position to destroy every one of you.\nThe Russians have come hither not for a day, nor yet a year, but for ever. They will not retire.\nIf you wish to live, ask for mercy. Should you prefer to die in Ak-Mechet, you can do so. I am not pressed for time, and do not intend to hurry you. I here repeat that I do not come to offer you combat, but to thrash you until you open your gates." -Governor General Vasily Perovsky\n\nAfter felling the Kazakh Khanate, the Russians have begun prioritizing the suppression of our influence over the Kazakh Steppe by sieging the key fort of Ak-Mechet. Governor-General Vasily Perovsky leads a detachment consisting of over 2,000 military personnel as well as 500 Kazakh volunteers who served as scouts and transported cargo. The fall of Ak-Mechet is all but inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SENIORZHUZ;\n\nWith the fall of the Middle Jüz, the remaining parts of the Kazakh Khanate, the Senior Jüz fell into decadence and wars with the Kyrgyz of the South, weakening further and increasingly seeking protection from us. While the various tribes of the Senior Jüz have always been more accepting of Russian influence in their lands, their distance from the Siberian frontiers had always made any type of formal annexation of their people unfeasible. Now that we have managed to extend our frontier south with the supprestion and integration of the Middle Jüz, we may now properly incorporate the Senior Jüz into the Russian Empire and end the sovereignty of the remaining Kazakh Jüzes once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENIORZHUZ2;\n\nOur increasing dependence on Russian protection has lead to them suggesting our formal annexation into the Russian Empire. The many tribes of the Senior Jüz have slowly warmed up to Russian influence throughout these past decades and many feel it is now the opportune time to apply for formal Russian citizenship, although this would undoubtably compromise our sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENIORZHUZ3;\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the Senior Jüz have recinded their petition of annexation! How should we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QINGNAYMAN;\n\nTroubles in the west between the Kazakhs and Russians have lead to the Nayman tribe of the Middle Jüz Kazakhs to seek protection from the Russians in our Empire. Who are we to deny sanctuary to those who are willing to bow before the true Son of Heaven?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN;\n\nBanbajan Fortress, built on our northernmost frontier on the left bank of the Syr Darya, has been captured and razed by the Kazakh warlord Zhankozha Nurmukhameduly! The fortress, dating to the past two decades, had been used as a staging point for exerting our influence and collecting tribute from the local Kazakhs as well as acting as a shield preventing incursions into the Syr Darya delta by the Khanate of Kokand. With the loss of this key fortress, our already shakey hold on our northern frontier has been completely shattered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN2;\n\nIn a daring land grab, the Khanate of Khiva has sent an army of 2000 soldiers to the Zhanaqala Fortress on the left bank of the Syr Darya across the river. Part of this detachment crossed to the right bank of the Syr Darya and ravaged the nomadic camps of Zhankozha Nurmukhamedov, plundering about 1000 families, capturing women and killing old people and children. Zhankozha and his detachment of 250 fled and swam across the Syr Darya and now petition S.E. Erofeev and Lieutenant P.S. Mertvago on-board the Schooner "Nikolai", one of the first Russian ships to sail the Aral Sea, to strike back against the Khivan forces who threaten to march and take Raimsk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN3;\n\nVictory has been achieved! Our strike against Zhankozha Nurmukhameduly's camp was not initially successful in capturing him, but luck was on our side as a small Russian have captured and delivered him to us! Apparently, he had approached the Russians and begged them to join him and his forces in attacking Zhanaqala Fortress. Thankfully the Russian garrison were not only reasonable in ignoring and delivering this nuisance to us, but have also evacuated the Raimsk Fortress in turn, showing their acceptance of our lordship over the whole of the Syr Darya delta. Things could not have gone any smoother for us! /nWith our control over the Syr Darya delta all but cemented, we can now look to expanding our horizons across the Aral Sea and up the Syr Darya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN4;\n\nCurses! While our raid of Zhankozha Nurmukhameduly's camp was successful, we were unable to capture or kill him. A day after his escape he and his host of 250 had returned along with a Russian warship that proceeded to fire on the Zhanaqala Fortress. While most of the garrison was able to flee, the majority of the loot and captives captured were taken back and the Fortress itself was completely destroyed! The destruction of Zhanaqala has emboldened the Russians to expand their influence into the left bank of the Syr Darya, the local Kazakhs fully accepting their rule without much resistance. Unfortunately, with the other troubles currently facing our nation, this loss spells the end of our dreams to dominate the coastal Aral Sea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHANKOZHA;\n\nThe colonization of the Aral Sea region by us had already started by 1845, but mass discontent with our newly established regime has only just recently begun. The Syr Darya Kazakhs have rebelled! The reason for which was the confiscation of some land from the local population. The uprising is led by Zhankozha Nurmukhamedov, who expressed his unwillingness to submit to the protege of the imperial court, Sultan Arslan Dzhantorin. The resistance of the Syr Darya Kazakhs under the leadership of Zhankozha is also joined by the surviving participants of the Kenesary uprising who are still bitter about their defeat a decade prior. The rebels are centered in the Zhanakala fortress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ESET;\n\nThe Alimuly Kazakhs are in open rebellion! High taxation on the local populace used to fund our continued expansion into the Kazakh Steppe has stressed our relations with the Kazakhs of the Junior Jüz to the point of revolt. The uprising is led by Eset Kotibaruli, who as put forward a number of demands: The removal of tax for households, the termination of punitive expeditions to the Kazakh Steppe, the allowing of usage of pastures, and the possibility to move into the banks of Rivers Zhem, Mugadzhar, Elek, Kobda, and Zhayyk. The resistance of the Alimuly Kazakhs under the leadership of Eset comes right at the tailend of the Kenesary rebellion and is sure to spiral out of control if we don't act fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
URALTURGAY;\n\nLarge swathes of the Ural and Turgai Oblasts have risen up in revolt! An implied increase in taxation regarding provisional regulations on the management of the Kazakh Steppe regions along with the restriction of the rights of the Muslim clergy and local Sultans and fundamental changes in the socio-spiritual sphere of society have angered the local populace. The Kazakhs have refused to submit to the tsarist administration, pay taxes, and do not allow commissions to carry out reforms into their villages. The Orenburg Governor-General has been informed that local tribes have elected their leaders - Bergen Kospanov, Seil Turkebaev, Kuspay Aibasov, Mambetali and Kanali Aryslanuly - to lead independent power in the regions. The rebel detachments have concentrated in the area of Lake Chelkar, the Taipak, Ulenti, Shiderty, and Ankaty tracts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADAI;\n\nAfter the hostile reaction and subsequent suppression of the local Kazakh populace in the Ural and Turgai Oblasts, the provisional regulations on the management of the Kazakh Steppe regions have expanded to also encompass the area of the Mangyshlak Peninsula held by the Adai clan of the Junior Jüz. While preventative measures had been taken to ensure an uprising as disruptive as the one in the years prior do not occur, unrest has nevertheless expanded into open revolt as a small rebel group lead by influential members of the Adai clan - Isa Tlenbaev, Dosan Tazhiev, Algi Zhalmambetov, and others - have refused to accept the new regulations and wage war against the central government of the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZCLEANUP;\n\nWe have managed to push back the foreign armies out of our lands and secure our independence! This calls for celebration! A new Kyrgyz Khanate can now be established!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZILI;\n\nWith the construction of the new capital of Ormonsaari and the settlement of Kyrgyz in it a success, it is time to consider further expansion along the Ile river. Let us not only settle along the full length of the river from the Balqash Koli to Qulja, but also past it and further into the Jetsi valleys! The key to manifesting the Kyrgyz's destiny lies in expanding ever northward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORMONOKUU;\n\n"In accordance with ancient Kyrgyz traditions, Ormon is dressed in red shoes, seated on a white felt, and is crowned as Khan by having a tebetei placed on his head. Nine white horses are sacrificed to honor the participants of the Kurultai as the chiefs and elites then take an oath of fealty by cutting a rod as a symbolic gesture of making a binding oath, and by this coronation ceremony, the supreme authority of Ormon Khan is confirmed."\nIn order to strengthen the fledgling Kyrgyz state, Ormon Khan has established a legal code refered to as the Teachings of Ormon that also includes a number of folk rites, edicts, and a decree that declared Ormon to be the sole khan of the Kyrgyz. The military has been reformed to be able to quickly defend against external attacks, including Ormon Khan's personal guard of the 30 most accurate Kyrgyz shooters. The Khan employs several groups of envoys whom are sent to various neighboring countries such as the Uzbeks, Russians, and the powerful Kyrgyz tribes in special diplomatic missions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORMONDEATH1;\n\nDespite being unified against external threats, the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate still suffers from internal strife and feuds. One of these feuds erupted with the Bugu tribe mainly caused by the domination of the Sarybagysh over the other tribes in the khanate. The two sides began raiding each other, and Ormon Khan officially declared war. After initial success in the campaign, Ormon attacked the main Bugu camp but was defeated by the Bugu, and Ormon was captured. Borombay Bekmuratuulu, the chief of the Bugu, wanted to use Ormon as a hostage, intending to release him only with assurances that Ormon would not attack the Bugu again. However, Balbay-baatyr, a Bugu leader and longtime rival of Ormon, stabbed Ormon with a spear, mortally wounding him.\nWith the death of Ormon Khan, his son Umetaaly dons the mantle of Kara-Kyrgyz Khan, but he lacks the strength and authority to consolidate the realm, which has once more fractured into various tribal leaders with no unifying head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORMONDEATH2;\n\nDespite being unified against external threats, the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate still suffers from internal strife and feuds.

However, Balbay-baatyr, a Bugu leader and longtime rival of Ormon, stabbed Ormon with a spear, mortally wounding him.\nWith the death of Ormon Khan, his son Umetaaly dons the mantle of Kara-Kyrgyz Khan and thanks to successful efforts to centralize the realm, remains in once piece, albiet still rife with tribal feudings and politicking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORMONDEATH3;\n\nOrmon Khan's death has resulted in the fracturing of the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate, this is the opportune time to march our armies north and reestablish our grip over the key forts of Pishpek, Tokmok, and Taraz and our dominion over the Kyrgyz inhabiting those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZVASSALAGE;\n\nThe instability following death of Ormon Khan and our strategic involvements in further destabilizing the Kyrgyz, has finally bore fruit! To protect themselves from feudal strife and the new khan's tyranny, the Bugu tribe, a powerfuly Kyrgyz clan, have begun taking measures to accept Russian citizenship. Borombai Bekmuratuulu, a prominent member of the Bugu clan, in order to save his kin from extermination, built a fortress in 1843 and repeatedly sent envoys to the Western Siberian authorities requesting to accept them into Russian citizenship, leading to him being awarded the rank of Colonel in 1853. More recently, his envoys have arrived in Omsk almost 1900 kilometers north and, holding a Quran, solemnly pledge allegiance to the Russian emperor on behalf of the Kyrgyz of the Bugu tribe and accepting Russian citizenship. Shall we accept the Bugu tribe's oath of vassalage, knowing that this will certainly anger many Kyrgyz, in particular the Bugu tribe's rivals, the powerful Sarybagysh tribe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UMETAALY;\n\nUmetaaly Ormonuulu, the eldest son of Ormon Khan and "heir" to the defunct Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate, leads a rebellion against our rule in Kyrgyzia!\nHe was the head of the Sarybagysh tribe in the war with the Bugu tribe after Ormon's death, which while in name was organized for revenge, in reality was used to restore his father's power. Captain Venyukov sent a detachment in 1860 to assist the Bugu allies, aiming to capture and punish the leaders of the Sarybagysh tribe. As more of the Kyrgyz tribes continued to recognize Russian rule, Umetaaly continued to resist. He attacked a group belonging to Second Lieutenant Zubarev, transporting supplies to Captain Protsenko, assembling thousands of warriors near the Naryn River. Waving Kyrgyz banners and accompanied by drums, they surrounded and engaged the group of Russian soldiers led by Lieutenant Zubarev, starting this uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANDIJANUPRISING;\n\nA nationalist rebellion has risen up centered on the city of Andijan in the Ferghana Valley in an attempt to restore the abolished Khanate of Kokand. The majority of the rebels are the Kyrgyz under the direction of the Naqshbandi Sufi Sheikh Muhammad Ali Madali "Dukchi Ishan".\n The reasons for the revolt were proclaimed as such: The strong moral deterioration of the people after our conquest, Russian non-compliance with Sharia law, our forbiddance of native pilgrimages to Mecca, the abolition of zakat or religious tax, tampering with local waqf laws, and that we do not trouble about the support of morality and family life.\nDespite its small, the rebellion has caused considerable alarm within the Tsarist government, revealing widespread dissatisfaction with our rule in Central Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOKQNGTREATY;\n\nOutnumbered and outplanned, our righteous Holy War against the Chinese was perhaps doomed from the start. Following the barbaric execution of Jahangir Khoja, many of his followers in Kashgaria dispersed, making a prolonged war against the Qing impossible to sustain.\n\nDespite this, our courage and prowess seems to have frightened the Dragon Throne to the core, and they have approached us with the intent of establishing cordial relations between our states. Their offer includes pardoning those who fought alongside us in Kashgaria, and most importantly, the position of being their preferred trade partner in Central Asia. While wary of rubbing shoulders with infidels, Madali Khan graciously accepted the agreement, aware of the riches it would bring to his Khanate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QINGZHETYSU;\n\nAs we have managed to extend our control west over the entirety of the Generalship of Ili, we are in a position to formalize a border with the Kazakhs of the Middle Jüz. In exchange for the far west grazinglands of the lower Shu River, we gain control over our traditional claims over Lebushi and its surrounding territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QINGZHETYSU2;\n\nAfter a period of rapid expansion into the Zhetysu region, an envoy from China has arrived detailing the establishment of a formal border between our two peoples. The resulting border would have us lose control over the grazing lands currently inhabited by the Eastern Nayman tribe, but would also grant us a claim over the tribes of the Senior Jüz not under Chinese rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZRAIDS;The continued existence of the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate has lead to an increase of hostile raids on our borders. Our poor relations with the Kyrgyz may be to blame for their hostility towards us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZRAIDS2;Recent raids against our neighbours have brought back a great deal of wealth and prestige for the Khanate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG1;\n\nTrouble brews in the west! The conquest of the Khanate of Kokand at the hands of the recently revived Kazakh Khanate has brought unwelcome disruption to the stability and trade networks of our western frontier. Kokand, a favoured trading partner of ours, served a vital link between the Celestial Empire and the commercce of Central Asia. Now, with Kazakh banners flying over the fertile Ferghana Valley and its cities, our court must consider the new order.\nThe Imperial Diet advises that the Khanate be made to pay tribute to the Empire and formally recognize the supreme authority of the Son of Heaven in compensation for the interruption of trade. In return, the Kazakh Khan may be acknowledged as the rightful ruler of his people and reaffirmed as the Shah of Turan -a title our realm once granted to the last Kazakh Khan, Ablai Khan, many years ago. Such recognition would also be followed by the formalization of our border with the Kazakhs, granting them lands inhabited by Kazakhs in exchange for strategic holdings in the Eastern Pamir mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG2;\n\nThe conquest of Kokand has attracted the attention of the Great Qing! The arrival of an Imperial envoy has stirred deep debate among the court. They demand compensation for our disruption of trade in the area as a consequence of our campaign against Kokand in the form of tribute, along with our symbolic acknowledgment of the supreme authority of the Qing Emperor. Yet this visit also come to us as an offer of peace and stability: In return for our symbolic submission, they offer to recognize our Khan as the rightful ruler of the Kazakhs and the Shah of Turan -a title once bestowed upon the great Ablai Khan himself. This deal would also settle our frontiers with the Chinese, granting them their claims in the Eastern Pamir mountains in exchange for recognizing our sovereignty over all Kazakh lands held by the Empire.\nTo refuse is to invite war with the vast realms of China, a force of immense strength and order. While victory would certainly propel our fledgling nation to heights never before seen in our history, to lose could threaten our people's hard fought survival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG3;\n\nThe Kazakh barbarians, blinded by arrogance and emboldened by their recent victories, have spurned the Middle Kingdom's gracious offer. Instead of humility, they chose defiance. Instead of friendship, they embrace insolence. Such betrayal of harmony cannot be tolerated. Our banners now move towards the Kazakh Steppe to restore balance, to discipline the ungrateful, and to remind all who exist between Heaven and Earth that the grace of the Dragon Throne is matched only by its power.\nAs it was with the Dzungars, who once defied the Middle Kingdom and were sweapt away by our righteous fury, so too shall it be with these Kazakh upstarts. Let them know what became of those who mistake leniency for weakness -entire nations erased, their banners burned, and their lands brought under the Son of Heaven's mandated domains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG4;\n\nAgainst all odds and to the astonishment of many, our great Khanate has added a mighty crack to the crumbling facade of Chinese invincibility, Their legions, once thought as endless as the sky and powerful as the heavens, lie broken, scattered across the wind-swept plains of old Dzungaria. Our riders now thunder through the great cities of the western frontier -Tsarkent, Kulja, Kashgar, Urumtsi- where Chinese banners have been torn down and replaced with the proud standards of the Kazakh army. The Eemperor, once distant and untouchable, at the behest of his court now sues for peace, humbled by the fury of the Steppe.\nAnd before the Khan lies a choice heavy with destiny: shall we only claim the lands settled by our kin and solidify the heart of our nation? Shall we press onwards into Altishar, ancient cradle of empires, where jade and blood flow freely, or conquer it entirely? Or shall we seize the full domains of the accursed Dzungar Khanate, not as looters, but as rightful conquerors and carve an imperial legacy from the bones of the old not seen since the days of Chagatai Khan?\nThe wind sings with prophecy, and the steppe waits for the Khan's word to echo across all of Central Asia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG5;\n\nThe Kazakh Steppe, once filled with boastful cries of defiance and delusions of grandeur, now lies broken and humbled beneath the might of the Middle Kingdom. In their arrogance, they dared not only to reject the gracious hand of peace extended by us but to also raise its hand in defiance -and for that insolence, they have paid dearly. Their riders flee before the thunder of Chinese arms and the unyielding advance of Imperial armies. Their primitive strongholds lie in ruin, their Khan brought low. Order has triumphed over disharmony.\nWith victory secured, the Emperor must decide the fate of this unruly frontier. Shall we impose the original terms between our peoples -peace through submission, tribute, and recognition of our supremacy? Or shall we press farther, extending our authority into the fertile Zhetysu Valley, long claimed by right of conquest over the Dzungars, and restoring the Kokand Khanate as a loyal trader partner and overseer of order in the region? Or perhaps the time has come to dissolve the Kazakh Khanate entirely, scattering its clans and placing all the Steppe under Imperial governance, as it was for the Dzungars who came before.\nThe Dragon has stirred -and the world will remember who commands the winds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAZARAAUTONOMY;\n\nDespite fierce resistance, our occupation of the Hazarajat can finally come to an end as the tribes of the area have agreed to acknowledge our suzerainty over the whole of the Hazarajat in exchange for autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBEYDULLAH;	\n\n"The Kurdish nation, consisting of more than 500,000 families is a people apart. Their religion is different, and their laws and customs distinct... We are also a nation apart. We want our affairs to be in our hands, so that in the punishment of our own offenders we may be strong and independent, and have privileges like other nations... This is our objective... Otherwise, the whole of Kurdistan will take matter into their own hands, as they are unable to put up with these continual evil deeds and the oppression, which they suffer at the hands of the Persian and Ottoman governments."\n\nRecent military setbacks has caused our influence among the Kurdish to wane in spite of their divided nature. Exploiting this disorder and lawlessness, the influential chieftain Sheikh Ubeydullah has been able to fill the power vacuum and expand his power base. A noted nationalist, his success of uniting the Kurdish tribes are a possible sign of a coming push for an independent Kurdistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBEYDULLAH2;\n\nAbdulkadir Ubeydullah and his force retreated to Mahabad, which they held for only a few days, because of Qajar forces coming from Tabriz. After eight weeks, the Kurdish rebels retreated and Sheikh Ubeydullah returned to Nehri. Eventually, Ubeydullah travelled to Istanbul asking the Ottomans for diplomatic support. Following his travel, the Ottomans began extensive negotiations with the Qajars on how to solve the conflict. Despite his rebellion against them, the Ottomans didn't want to lose the possibility of assistance from Sheikh Ubeydullah's troops in an eventual war against the Qajars in the future. After all, Sheikh Ubeydullah was able to raise a considerable number of troops. Both the Ottomans and the Qajars demanded reparations from the other side due to their losses they experienced from Ubeydullah's rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LURISTAN1;\n\nQajar relations with the Lurish tribes have always been strained due to the Zand Dynasty's Lurish origins and our policies of divide and rule employed by Qajar Princes sent to govern the region. Our governance, while having lead to the deterioration of urban life in Luristan, to the point where Khorramabad is the last remaining center of urban life in the region as villagers and peasants abandon the sedentary way of life in favour of nomadism, has by-and-large kept the region under the crown's authority. Now, Qajar governors are unable to even enter Khorramabad as the local tribes turn to autonomous polities and all social, legal and political problems are settled within the tribe. The tribes have not form a unified confederacy, and nor is there any separatist movement. Rather, they are mainly concerned with protecting themselves from each other and from outside intruders. In other words, they are constantly engaged in alliance and re-alliance against each other and the Peacock Throne's rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AGAKHAN1;\n\nHasan Ali Shah, also known as Aga Khan, an honorific given to him by Fath-Ali Shah when he was appointed as governor of Qom, is the 46th hereditary Imam of the Nizari Ismailis. Soon after the accession of Mohammad Shah to the throne, Hasan Ali Shah was appointed governor of Kerman. The region was home to many rebellious princes and witnessed frequently raids by the Afghans but Hasan Ali Shah managed to restore order in Kerman, as well as in Bam and Narmashir, which were also held by rebellious groups.\nDespite the service he has rendered to the government, Hasan Ali Shah has been dismissed from the governorship of Kerman, less than two years after his arrival there, replaced by Firuz Mirza Nusrat al-Dawla, a younger brother of Mohammad Shah. Refusing to accept his dismissal, Hasan Ali Shah has withdrawn with his forces to the citadel at Bam. Along with his two brothers, he has made preparations to resist the government forces that have been sent against him. We must stop him in Bam before instability has time to settle in Kerman again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AGAKHAN2;\n\nAga Khan returns to Kerman to revolt once again! When it was clear that continuing his resistance was of little use and with the governor of Fars having interceded on his behalf, Hasan Ali Shah surrendered and emerged from the citadel of Bam only to be double-crossed with Hasan Ali Shah and his dependents were sent to Kerman and remained as prisoners. He was eventually allowed to go to Tehran where he was able to present his case before the Shah. The Shah pardoned him on the condition that he return peacefully to his hometown of Mahallat where he remained for 2 years. He managed to gather an army there, which he explained as being guards for a pilgrimage to Mecca. Prior to leaving Mahallat, Hasan Ali Shah equipped himself with letters appointing him to the governorship of Kerman. Soon after, he siezed the citadel of Shahr-e Babak from Afghans which had first taken it from the local governor, which he intended to use as his base for capturing Kerman. Aga Khan's continued rebellion against the crowned must be crushed once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOORAMAN;\n\nThe Hooraman region on our western border has been governed by local Baghzadeh rulers under the direct supervision of the central government of Iran for 800 years. Recently our administration, paying no regard to this issue and without considering the ethnic differences between the Hooraman rulers and the governors of Ardalan, their historic rivals, have sought to completely cede this region to the governors of Ardalan, which has led to the birth of a major rebellion. The rebellion has caused unrest and chaos that has spilled into parts of Ottoman Iraq causing  diplomatic tensions as the incident is covered in Turkish newspapers in both Turkish and French. \nDespite the revolt ultimately being crush by the Ardalan governor with backing from the central government, the incident has left Ardalan Emirate bankrupt, paving the way for its dissolution and the end of autonomous Kurdish rule in Kurdistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AFSHARID;\n\nThe Afsharid Empire, once though completely destroyed at the hands of the Qajar tribe, has been reborn from the ashes and now stands to reclaim its lost glory. But before we embark on any new campaigns, we must first decide the nature of our Empire. Many say it is natural to adopt the long standing Persian structure for our Empire's administration as the Qajars, Zands, Safavids, and Afsharids before had. Some say the decadence of Persian courtly life is what allows dynastic rot to seep into great Empires, leaving them vunerable to collapse. There are also some who say the administrative style of the Tajik Persians in the east, Used by the Uzbek Khanates in the north, could instead be used as a framework for our new Empire.\nWhichever form of governance ends up shaping our fledgling state, it is certain the God favours us and shall bring us continued victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But through a string of losses against them in near memory, Kokand faltered under pressure. Rather than continue to resis alongside us, they chose cowardice and betrayal. Their fear turned to treachery when they struck against our people, culminating in the brutal murders of the family of Kenesary Qasymuly - Brothers, wives, and children - This act of cruelty has cannot go unanswered as now, the Kazakh banners gather for war against the traitorous Kokand! Yet we know §Bsuch a campaign will not go unnoticed by the Chinese§W who favour Kokand for their trade.

siege_akmechet_desc;Placed on the defensible Syr Darya river, Ak-Mechet is an important northern outpost of the Kokand Khanate, used as a base to collect tax and to control trade between us and southern Central Asia and used for frequent attacks by Kokandi and Kokandi allied Kazakh forces against us interfering with our goal of capturing Khiva. Due to the influence it gives Kokand over the Kazakh Steppe, its capture or destruction is a priority for realizing our goals of expanding into Central Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

unite_afghanistan_title;Unite Afghanistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_afghanistan_desc;After the collapse of the Durrani Empire, Afghanistan has never been more divided, with dozens of independent tribes, emirates, and khanates laying claim to various parts of the old Empire. Loyalties constantly shift, as alliances are forged and broken in the struggle for supremacy, while foreign powers like the British and the Persians have sought to exploit these fractured states for their own ambitions. Amidst the chaos, the idea of unification still lingers, but it is still burdened by tribal rivalries, regional autonomy, and the absence of a single leader strong enough to bind the nation under one banner once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

restore_faizabad_mines_desc;Ever since Mir Muhammad Murad Beg of Kunduz sacked Faizabad and relocated a massive portion of its population to the desolate swamps of Kunduz, the formerly world-renowned Sar-e Sang lapis lazuli mines of Badakhshan have fallen to disrepair. Repairing these mines will require both major reforms to local land distribution and a heafty investment of from our treasury, but the reestablishment of these mines would be a massive boon for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

kyrgyz_ili_capital_desc;With the lush pastures surrounding the right bank of the Ile River in our hands, the time has come to commence a grand project: A new capital for the Kara-Kyrgyz! The scale of this task goes far beyond the simple villages and ordos our people are accustom to. It shall be the foundation of a grand city built on new European principles to rival grand cities like Kokand, Samarkand, and Turkistan. We shall name the city after Ormon Khan, the great Khan that lead our people to their freedom and across the Ala-Too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

kyrgyz_ili_settle_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! With the construction of Ormonsaari complete and our dominance over the Ile River cemented, we can now begin the next phase of developing our empire and settle the lands with Kyrgyz. While at one point decades prior our people fled to here from the lands south of the Ala-Too momentarily to gain respite from the army of Kokand only to return after peace was made with the Khan, this era of migration shall be a more permanent one as we restructure tribal lines and adopt a more sedentary way of life in imitation of the Sarts and Europeans. This disruption of the status-quo is sure to upset the Kazakh nomads inhabiting the region with us, but they too will learn this new way of life in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the Sarts to the south, Russians and Kazakhs to the north and west, and Manchu to the east, there is no shortage of vultures lurking in our periphery waiting for the opportune time to strike at us in a moment of weakness. We must arm ourselves with the best of weapons, discipline ourselves with the strictest of training, and expand our domain across the to the highest of mountains if we are to survive as a people.

As the people who bear the same name and legacy as the old Qirqiz, it is vital that we retake our claims over our rightful dominion and restore the glory of the old Kyrgyz Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

rus_vassalize_kyr_desc;With the death of Ormon Khan, Khan of the Kyrgyz and ally of ours during the Kenesary Rebellion, the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate has collapsed in all but name after Ormon Khans capture and execution at the hands of the rival Bugu clan. All pretenses of cooperation between our peoples have died with him, but a new opportunity presents itself: by employing Kazakh raiders to march south and disrupt the fragile peace and unity between the various Kyrgyz tribes, §Bwe may be able to strong-arm the Kyrgyz into accepting vassalage in exchange for protection.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With pressure mounting not only from us, but also from Yakub-beg of Kashgar in the east, Umetaaly now approaches us to submit to our rule. With the last of the Kyrgyz tribe under our dominion, the time has finally come to end any further notion of Kyrgyz autonomy and dissolve the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bukharan_ambitions_desc;The wicked Madali Khan of Kokand has stretched his nation too thin with his recent expansion into Khatlon and the Kazakh Steppe and has now resorted to plotting with the infidel Russians to expand his decadent influence across pious Muslim lands. With rumors of Madali Khan's recent marriage to his own step-mother, an act expressedly forbidden in Islam, we can use this opportunity to strike at Kokand, waging holy war against the decadent Madali Khan to restore pious rule over Kokand and take our claims on Ura-Teppe and Khojand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_arabestan_desc;The Emirate of Arabestan has always served as a useful middle-man between the local Arab population and central Iranian authority with relations between the ruling Sheikhs in Muhammara and Tehran remaining fairly cordial throughout the century. But as Iran reforms itself into a modern nation-state that uses modern administrative practices, the role of the Sheikh of Arabestan has grown redundant. This, along with the recent discovery of oil in the region of Arabestan means it is more important now that ever to enforce direct rule from Tehran over the region, lest our grip slowly be weakeened and Arabestan wrest from our grasps. It should be noted, however, that recent developments in the region have lead to the Sheikh of Arabestan to ally with the local Bakhtiari clans. Any attempt at a military campaign into the region is sure to anger them into their own full scale revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_luristan_title;Restore Order to Luristan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_luristan_desc;We have let the Lurish tribes have autonomy for too long. While the Qajar policy of divide and rule, along with the intentional withholding of troops and funds from our governors until now has been the main factor in Luristan's current lawlessness, recent reforms in our administration finally prepare us to attempt to restore much needed order in the region. In addition, we will also be able to campaign past the Zagros Mountain into the province of Poshtkuh and revoke the governorship of the province from the ruling Feyli tribe, ending over 700 years of autonomous Lurish rule in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_maku_title;Dissolve the Maku Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_maku_desc;The Khanate of Maku has existed as a semi-autonomous entity since the collapse of Nader Shah's Afsharid Empire. It served as a vital frontier against both the Russians in the north and the Ottomans in the west, but as we modernize our nations in accordance with western ideas of statehood, we must rid ourselves of these antiquated remnants of feudalism. We need to revoke their autonomy and reform these lands in a central $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administration;;;;;;;;;;;;;

annex_maraqeh_desc;Originally a clan of the Otuziki tribe of Karabakh, the Moghaddams of Maraqeh haved served as regional governors of Maraqeh and the surrounding areas since the time of Safavid Shah Abbas I. As our modernization efforts continue in accordance with western ideas of statehood, we must incorporate the Moghaddam into the national government and revoke their status as self-governing provincial rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

zands2_desc;Karim Khan Zand of the Zandiye tribe of Lurs once commanded a nation that stretched from Derbend in the Caucasus to Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf. While the Qajar's brutal slaughter of any potential Zand claimants prevent us from formally reestablishing the dynasty in Luristan, with the capture of Shiraz, we can still attempt to claim the lands of the kingdom as the final form of our new Lurish state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Afshar tribe that rule over the Andkhoy Khanate, one of the four constituents of the Chahar Vilayets, are a proud and hardy people who's name once struck fear throughout all of Iran and Turan under the flag of Nader Shah Afshar. With the Chahar Vilayets down on its luck with the secession of the Sar-e Pol Khanate, perhaps a change in leadership is needed to restore our former strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

afsharids2_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Less than a century ago, the Afshar tribe were masters over the whole of Khorasan.

In 1796, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, seized Mashhad and tortured the last Afsharid Shah, Shahrokh Shah Afshar, to force him to reveal the whereabouts of Nader Shah's treasures. Shahrokh died of his injuries soon after and with him the Afsharid dynasty came to an end. With our position in Khorasan secured, it is time for us to restore the Afshar Empire by taking back the heartlands of the Guarded Domains of Iran back from the usurping Qajars. Onwards to Tehran! §BUse the command 'debug color KHR 20 80 160' if your colour doesn't update§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Afghan provinces containing the great cities of Kabul, Kandahar, and Ghazni were a vital part of the Afsharid Empire before Ahmad Shah Durrani declared his independence by founding the Durrani Empire, which also crumbled soon after their founding leader died. Let us bring the fragmented heirs of the traitorous Ahmad Shah back into the Afshar fold and use Afghanistan's strategic location as a staging ground for future campaigns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

afsharids5_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! The Khanate of Kalat and the rest of the fragmented tribes of Baluchistan were previously vassal states of the old Afshar Empire.

The great cities of Khiva, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Fayzabad all used to bow before Afshar dominance and must do so once again. Let us ride to the Land Beyond The River and establish a northern frontier that will keep the Guarded Domains safe from any threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
afsharids7_title;Realize Nader Shah's Ambitions in Mesopotamia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
afsharids7_desc;§RGain 6 infamy§! Nader Shah's Mesopotamian Campaign was meant to be a grand turning point in the future of the Empire. His victory against the Ottomans would force the Sunni Caliph to accept an altered form of the Shiite sect into the greater Sunni orthodoxy as the Ja'fari School of Islam. Unfortunately, his deteriorating health and disinterest with conquest after the blinding of his son Reza Qoli prevented him from finishing his grand design. While our ultimate goals do not involve the transformation of the Sunni and Shia faiths, we can still honour him by conquering lands in Mesopotamia and defeating the mighty Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
afsharids8_title;Campaign Across The Persian Gulf;;;;;;;;;;;;;
afsharids8_desc;§RGain 4 infamy§! Nader Shah's conquests of the southern coast of the Persian Gulf and Oman were intended to transform the Afshar empire into the hegemonic state of the Gulf. While his campaigns were all initially successful, the rebellion of Mohammad Taghi Khan, Grand Admiral of the Empire, lead to some of the gained territories being lost, which while regained after the rebellion was suppressed, did not survive the dissolution of the Empire after Nader Shah's death. If we are able to reestablish a navy, now based on advanced European priciples, we may be able to reattempt a campaign across the Gulf and reestablish ourselves as the masters of the Persian Gulf and Oman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
afsharids9_title;Invade India;;;;;;;;;;;;;
afsharids9_desc;§RGain 15 infamy§! Undoubtably, Nader Shah Afshar's greatest achievement was the crushing of the Mughal Empire during his invasion of India. The once great Mughal Empire, then a weak and crumbling state, was stuck by a swift and final death blow by Nader Shah, leading to the collapse of the Mughals. The spoils taken in the infamous sacking of Delhi was so valuable that Nader Shah stopped taxation in Iran for a period of three years following his return.\nNow that we have reestablished our hegemony over the Afghans, Uzbeks, and Baluch through these years of campaigning, we may seek to repeat this legendary campaign and launch our own invasion into India, but this time, instead of facing a rotting and decadent Mughal Empire, we would have to face the great and mighty British Empire instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

During a recent visit to Gyumri, Tsar Nicholas has passed a decree to rename the city to Alexandropol, in honor of his wife, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, who has changed her name to Alexandra Fyodorovna after converting to Orthodox Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
