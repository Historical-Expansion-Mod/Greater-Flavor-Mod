AUSTINFOUNDING;The Founding of Austin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUSTINFOUNDINGDESC;\n\nA small pioneer settlement situated on the Colorado River in central Texas has been chosen as the republic's seventh and final capital. Incorporated under the name Waterloo, the town has been renamed Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NINKODEATH;The Death of Emperor Ninko;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NINKODEATH2;\n\nEmperor Ninko, the 120th Emperor of Japan, has passed away. Ninko's reign has spanned from 1817 to 1846, seeing further deterioration of the power of the ruling Shogun. Disasters, including famine, combined with corruption and increasing Western interference, have helped to erode public trust in the bakufu government. It is hard to say what role, if any, the Emperor had in the turmoil which occurred during his reign, as Japan is ruled by the shogun and an emperor's role is primarily ceremonial. He has been enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, Nochi no Tsukinowa no Higashiyama no misasagi. Prince Osahito, Emperor Ninko's fourth son, has now assumed the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH;The Death of Francis I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH2;\n\nBorn in 1777, Francis I, who ascended to the throne in 1825, has passed away today at the age of 53. He pursued a course of conservatism during his reign. He only rarely took part in the government, which he left in the hands of his favorites and police officials. Thus, the king lived with his mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of assassination. During his reign, the only revolutionary movements to erupt were the Cilento Riots of 1828. After a lengthy period of illness, King Francis entered a period of delirium before finally passing away. In his final moments, plagued by hallucinations of a revolution, he hysterically cried out: "What are these voices? The people want a constitution? Give it to them!" He is succeeded by his son to his second wife, Ferdinand II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH;The Death of Charles Felix;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH2;\n\nBorn in 1765 and crowned King of Sardinia in 1821, Charles Felix has passed away today at the age of 66. He was the last male-line member of the House of Savoy, leaving the throne to his distant cousin Charles Albert of Savoy-Carignano, regent of Sardinia. His rule began with the abdication of his father, Victor Emmanuel I to Liberal Revolutionaries in 1821. He was regarded as a true reactionary, and was rarely present in Turin as king, having no particular affection for the Turinese due to the prior revolution. He tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior, reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterized by Massimo d'Azeglio, a prominent statesman, as "a despotism full of straight and honest intentions but its representatives and arbiters were four old chamberlains, four old maids of honor, with a hive of friars, priests, monks, and jesuits.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH;The Death of Emperor Mutsuhito;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH2;\n\nEmperor Mutsuhito, now known by his posthumous name Meiji, has died today after a period of publicized suffering. With the death of the Mikado of Japan, the Meiji Era closes, -- a period which stands out in the long history of Japan as the most illustrious and most enlightened and represents an evolution and progress unequalled in a similar time in the history of any other nation. It has witnessed the transformation of Japan from a hermit island empire, under provincial feudal rule, to a world power of the first class. It has been an era of glorious victories, and, above all, of unparalleled advancement. The death of His Majesty Mutsuhito, in the 60th year of his life and the 44th year of his reign, will doubtless have a very far reaching effect upon the peoples and politics of Asia if not upon those of the entire world. For it was during his august reign that Japan not only opened her gates to the peoples and commerce of the world, but fairly entered into the comity of nations. The late Mutsuhito will be succeeded to the throne by his son Yoshihito, his Majesty the new Emperor, who was married in 1900 to the Princess Sadako and has a son and heir, the Prince Hirohito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELBEFLOOD1845;\n\nA severe winter hitting the country has caused an ice dam to form on the river Elbe, trapping the water behind it. A sudden thaw, which resulted in heavy snow melting in the German low mountain ranges and the rapid break-up of the frozen Elbe, has triggered the flood. When the dam finally gave way to the mass of water, it took a substantial part of the dike flanking the river with it. The water has now flooded into the valley along the river, destroying many homes and farms from northern Bohemia to Anhalt in the process. The city of Dresden has been hit particularly hard by the flooding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
propagandaphi;\n\nA movement has recently sprung up in the Philippines encompassing the activities of a group of Filipinos who call for political reforms in their lands that we control, producing books, leaflets, and newspaper articles to educate others about their goals and supposed issues they are trying to solve. The Propagandists' aims include representation in the parliment, secularization of the clergy, the guarantee of basic civil freedoms, The abolishment of labor services and the forced sale of local products to the government, and legal equality for the native Filipinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

move_capital_australia_desc;With the Federation of Australia coalescing the six self-governing colonies Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia into one cohesive unit, a decision must be made on where the capital city of this entity is to reside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ast_capital_title;The Capital Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ast_capital_desc;\n\nA heated debate has sprung up in parliment regarding potential locations of the capital of Australia. Due to the recent gold rush in Victoria, Melbourne is now Australia's largest city and a suitable place for the capital. However Sydney, rival city to Melbourne, is Australia's oldest, and so also has a justifiable claim to host the new nation's Federal polity. To select one city would certainly anger the populace in the other as the Sydney–Melbourne rivalry is such that neither city would never agree to the other one becoming the capital. As such, a political compromise has also been suggested: A new capital, Canberra, is to be built somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne in the larger state of New South Wales, so long as it was at least 160km from Sydney. This option would help prevent a rise in tensions in either city at the cost of developing a new city from the ground up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CASPIAN1;\n\nAs our control over the nothern coast solidifies, we are able to project more and more power southwards down the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea. While the land is relatively desolate comparted to the southern and western coast, mainly consisting of dry deserts in the north and mountains in the south populated by nomadic Turkmen and Kazakhs, a small foothold in the region will be useful in our attempt to increase our regional power projection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AKMECHETLOSS;\n\nWith our control over the city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan lost, it has become impossible for us to supply and maintain our line of forts along the Syr-Darya river, including the key fortress of Ak-Mechet. The territory now rests in the hands of the local Kazakh nomads belonging to the Middle Jüz. We can only hope this turn of events is only a temporary set-back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AKMECHETGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Kokand having lost the key city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan, they can no longer defend it. We will therefore take it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERVLOSS;\n\nWith our connection to the Merv oasis lost, it has become impossible for us to supply and defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERVGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Khiva having lost connection to the oasis city of Merv, they can no longer defend it. We will therefore take it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Kokand busy dealing with a massive Kyrgyz revolt to their north-east, they have become unable to defend their holdings along the Shu and Syr Darya Rivers, including the our former capital of Turkistan. Kenesary, with the help of the his two brother-Khans and their younger cousin, Aziz id-Din Bahadur, son of Nauryzbai Bahadur, has gathered a large troop of well-trained Kazakhs to capture these key fortresses along the Syr Darya in the name of bolstering our forces against the Russian menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUGAIN2;\n\nLike vultures, they have decended on us! As we deal with war to our north and south, a large troop of Kazakhs led by Kenesary Khan and his generals have swiftly taken our lands surrounding the Syr Darya and Shu Rivers up to the important city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan. \n\nThis loss is yet another stain on the young Madali Khan's legacy and failing to meet these Kazakh invaders in battle would further exacerbate this, but perhaps it would be wiser to focus our limited resources on ending our current conflicts instead of starting new ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHIVAMERVINVASION;\n\nThe Turkmen of the Karakum Desert have historically bent the knee to the Khivan Khan, paying taxes in the form of Zakat and tribute. Recently, our grip over the Turkmen has loosed and it falls to Allah Quli Khan to reestablish Khivan authority in the region, focusing on the Merv Oasis in the southeast, and the Sariq Turkmens located there, and the frontier lands of Sarakhs bordering the Persians, along with the Akhal Turkmen who reside there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHIVAMERVINVASIONTKM;\n\nThe Khan of Khiva, Allah Quli Khan, in his infinite greed and foolishness has levied a mighty army and marches it towards Sarakhs, having already taken the Merv Oasis and its neighbouring lands. It falls to us, the Teke Tribe, to resist this mad Khan and his foolhardy attempt to expand his influence in our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS1;\n\nIn an effort to make up for his defeats in the Second Russo-Persians War and bolster his claim to the throne, Abbas Mirza has invaded the areas east and northeast of Mashhad, taking control of the notable settlments of Khabushan, Torbat-e Heydarieh, and Sarakhs, solidifying our control over Khorasan and allowing us to properly push our claims over southern Turkmenia. The latter city of Sarakhs having been recently conquered by the Khanate of Khiva, has been quickly taken from the Khivans before proper control could be established. Abbas Mirza's poor health means this could very well be the final conflict he personally leads as he takes a step back and waits for the eventual passing of this father, Fath-Ali Shah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS2;\n\nFollowing our victory over the Teke Turkmen in the south, a Persian army, led by the Qajar heir-apparent Abbas Mirza, has used the opportunity to swiftly seize the border city of Sarakhs! Shall we launch a counter invasion of the territory and punish the Persians for their transgression? While Sarakhs is a notable settlment in northern Khorasan, it lays at the edge of our southern frontier and may not be worth going to war against the Persians over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS3;\n\nIn retaliation to our seizure of Sarakhs, Allah Quli Khan has launched a large-scale invasion of our northern border. This has escalated what should have been a minor shifting of the border into a larger conflict. We must use this opportunity to push our claims over the Merv Oasis and establish a distant frontier from the Khorasani heartland. May Allah grant us certain victory against the Khivan Horde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS4;\n\nWe are victorious over the weak Qajar Dynasty. The remaining lands in Northern Khorasan and the Turkmen Sahra are ours for the taking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN1;\n\nKasim Sultan, son of the last Kazakh Khan, Ablai Khan, has for over half a decade protested against our expansion into the Kazakh Steppe. In 1825, he lodged multiple protests with the various Governors of our frontier, drawing attention to the construction of fortifications in their domain, recalling the agreements between his father and Russia regarding the establishment of a formal border between our peoples. These requests were all rejected, marking the beginning of a now 7 year long series of raids on our frontier settlements and caravans.\nSarzhan Kasimov, son of Kasim, follows his father in rebellion and has conducted many campaigns against the local Cossacks, stealing thousands of guns and horses and killing many Cossacks. While his raidings haven't yet proven difficult to repel, there are whispers of a joint invasion of the Kushbeg of Tashkent, Lord-General of the Kokand Khanate, in order to permanently expel us from the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN2;\n\nRecently, a Kazakh noble by the name of Sarzhan Qasymuly has approached us with an interesting offer:\n\n He proposes joint invasion of the Middle Jüz in order to expell all Russian influence in the area. In the past decade, Sarzhan and his family have been conducting raids on Russian garrisons and caravans, but have not been successful in pushing the Russians out of the Kazakh Steppe. If we agree to his offer and drive out the Russians, not only will our influence in the wild north be cemented, giving us a powerful bulwark against Russian intervention in the region, but we may also be able to use this influence to gain a permanent foothold over the Syr Darya delta, giving us access to the bounties of the Aral Sea. Defeating the Russians may be be a monumental task, §Bbut there is little threat they can pose to us even if we aren't successful.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN3;\n\nA great army comprising Kazakhs lead by Sarzhan Qasymuly and Kokandi soldiers lead by the Kushbeg of Tashkent has marched into our lands in order to expel the Russians and exert their own influence over the tribes of the Middle Jüz. They have swiftly attacked and taken the key fortresses of Sozaq and Taraz south of the Chu river and now head north to take the fight straight to the Russians. We can only hope the Russians and their Cossack garrisons are prepared to fend off this great army!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SARZHAN4;\n\nWith our great victory over the Kazakhs assisted by the perfidious Russians, we have managed to install Sarzhan Qasymuly as a puppet Khan of the Middle Jüz clans. With our northern border stable for the time being, we are able to once again extend our influence down the Syr Darya Delta and finally wrest control over the eastern Aral Sea coast from the local Kazakh and Karakalpaks. A great day for the Khanate of Kokand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY1;\n\nThroughout the past century, our northern neighbour has continued their efforts in increasing their influence over our lands. As the Russian Empire penetrate deeper and deeper into Kazakh lands, Kenesary Qasymuly, grandson of Ablai Khan and brother of the late Sarzhan Qasymuly, and notable detractor of the Russians, has proven himself equal to his brother in fighting back against the Russians, gathering many local nobles of the Junior and Middle Jüz, formalizing a mutual pact in opposition to the Russians and their expansion south. Kenesary's rise to power is sure to once again upset the Russian-favouring status-quo. May this be the beginning of a new Kazakh golden age!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY2;\n\nThe Kazakh people have long since held a position of protectorate of the Russian Empire, yet any actual control over the Kazakh Steppes has proven difficult to come by. A century's worth of fortification construction and pacification has led to only the edges of these lands falling into line as the interior continues to be governed by local clans and tribes. And yet, our accelerating pacification of the Steppes, largely due in part to our superior technology and tactics, have startled the local populace enough for them to rally around the leadership of a Kenesary Kasimov, grandson of the last Kazakh Khan, Ablai Khan, and brother of the dead and defeated Sarzhan Kasimov. His presence has disrupted our nominal overlordship over the Kazakhs and §RIs certain to escalate into all-out war in the coming years...§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY3;\n\nKenesary's success in the recent campaign against the Khanate of Kokand has dramatically boosted his popularity among the tribes of the Kazakh steppe. In response to his victory, a Kurultay has been convened and Kenesary Khan has been elected as the Khan of All-Kazakhs, a title not in use since the death of Ablai Khan, Kenesary's grandfather, 40 years ago. The three Jüz are finally reunited after all this time and a horde of twenty thousand has been levied to resist the Russians to the north and the Uzbeks to the south. The Khanate must not fall, the Khanate will not fall! \n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY4;\n\nThe upstart Kenesary Kasimov has united the disparate Kazakh clans and reunited the thought-to-be-dead Kazakh Khanate. Kenesary Khan's coronation has lit a fire under our Kazakh subjects as he sets his sights on the our lands in Central Asia. It is unknown if he will continue with the small-scale assaults and caravan raids as he has done up until now, but it is in our best interest to mobilize a force on our borders in anticipation of any movement from his horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY5;\n\nThe upstart Kenesary Kasimov, brother of Sarzhan Kasimov, has made his first move against us. Kenesary's military operations began in the spring with the siege of Akmolinsk fortress. The garrison commander of the fortress, Ivan Karbyshev, and the Senior Sultan of the Akmolinsk district, Konyrkulzha Kudaymendin barely managed to escape the burned fortress. The rebel army now marches back to Turgay, where Kenesary plans to extend the revolt to the lands of the Junior Jüz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY6;\n\nAkmolinsk Prikaz was well protected. Deep ditches were dug in the district, all nearby approaches were blocked. The Akmolinsk Prikaz was guarded by the troops of the Russian puppet Konurkuldzha Kudaimendin and the garrison of the fortress, led by the Ivan Karbyshev. The offensive of Kenesary's troops began at dawn. Kazakh archers fired at the fortress with bows, attaching flammable tarred rags to the arrowheads. Numerous fires broke out in the fortress. At that moment, when part of the garrison rushed to fight the fire, one of the detachments of Kenesary, despite the heavy fire, broke the enemy resistance and penetrated the fortification. \nThe next day, the ruined fortress was still on fire, its destruction, now clearly visible in the daylight. \nKenesary Khan's attack on the Russian fortress of Akmolinsk has been successful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY7;\n\nThe situation in the Kazakh steppe has taken a turn for the worse. Kenesary Kasimov, now Kenesary Khan is no longer content in merely raiding border forts and harrassing caravans but has raised a host of over twenty thousand men and plans to march through our lands, capturing and sacking whatever settlement of ours he and his horde can find. We cannot continue to allow his to act as freely as he has up until now, lest he continue to gain legitimacy among his peers and truly threaten our hold over the region. Thankfully, it seems not everything is in Kenesary Khan's favour; Many of the tribes in the south and east, while nominally serving him, refuse to muster arms against us and even among the tribes who do fight along side him do not do so full-heartedly, making it easy to tempt their betrayal. In addition, Omron Khan of the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate to the Kazakhs' south eyes Kazakh lands in the Zhetysu basin and seems willing to assist us in putting down this rebellion. It is time for us to crush this pretender Khan and reestablish our rightful dominion over the Kazakhs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY8;\n\nThe time has come! We can no longer continue with merely pestering the Russian frontiers with small raids and skirmishes. Kenesary Khan has levied a horde of over twenty thousand horsemen from all clans and tribes and to deal a decisive blow to the Russian menace and liberate the remaining Kazakhs still under their boot. Victory certainly will not come easy; The majority of the tribes of the Senior Jüz still refuse to come into direct conflict with the Russian. §RThe eastern Nayman tribe in Lopsin have also refused to fight§W, clinging to the Qing Empire in a cowardly attempt to avoid meeting the Russians in battle. To make things worse, Omron Khan of the reemergent Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate has begun to harrass our people in the south, aiming to conquer lands in the Zhetysu basin. Even so, we must not give in to despair nor lie down without a fight. Victory for the Kenesary Khan! Victory for the Kazakh Khanate! \n§RNOTE: Only one wargoal needs to be enforced to achieve full victory.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY9;\n\nWhile Kenesary Khan may nominally be Khan of All-Kazakhs, the majority of the tribes of the Senior Jüz do not follow him to battle. Little has changed for the average nomad in the Zhetysu basin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY10;\n\nWe have emerged victorious! Kenesary Khan has defied the odds and brought defeat to the Russian Empire. The liberation of all Kazakhs from Orda to Alma-Ata has been achieved as Russian forces have been push out of our lands. Kenesary Khan's legitimacy and dominance is now unquestioned and the various tribes and clans of the three Jüz who still held Russian sympathies have fallen in line and now answer only to the Shah-i Turan. While this does not spell the end for future Russian interference in Central Asia, this defeat is sure to be a setback large enough to allow us to focus on our enemies to the south and east. Sarhan Qasymuly has been avenged! Ablai Khan looks down to us with pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY11;\n\nThe conflict between Kenesary Khan of the Kazakhs and the Russian Empire has concluded with the crushing defeat of the Kazakh forces. Russian troop have recently besieged and captured their capital city in Turkistan, yet have not established any form of a permanent garrison, implying either a lack of desire or inability to hold the territory this far south. With the Kazakh tribes in disarray and the Russian returning north, this is the perfect opportunity to reestablish our hold over the Syr Darya and the various fortresses and cities which were taken from us by Kenesary Khan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY12;\n\nThe impossible has happened! Even in the face of the overwhealming might of the Russian Empire, even after the death of Kenesary Khan, the great Khan of All-Kazakhs, we have managed to emerge victorious against our enemy. Kenesary's remaining generals managed to stabilize the collapsing horde long enough to push back the Russian army and secure total victory over the Russians, liberating all of our rightful lands to our north and west. Now we must see whether we are able to recover from the death of our Khan and elect a new Khan of All-Kazakhs or if we will once again succumb to infighting amongst ourselves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY13;\n\nIt was too good to be true... \n\nDespite our miraculous victory over the Russian Empire, without a leader, the now scattered and aimless Kazakh tribes have once again divided themselves along clan lines. Only time will tell if another Khan of All-Kazakhs will emerge from our disunified peoples, and raise the Kazakh banner across the steppe once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY14;\n\nWith the future of the Kazakh steppe uncertain, where might the winds of fortune for our people blow next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY15;\n\nThe impossible has happened! Even in the face of the overwhealming might of the Russian Empire, even after the death of Kenesary Khan, the great Khan of All-Kazakhs, we have managed to emerge victorious against our enemy. Kenesary's remaining generals managed to stabilize the collapsing horde long enough to push back the Russian army and secure our independence. While we were unable to liberate any of our bretheren directly under the rule of the Russians, we must be content that we were able to save those that we could. Now we must see whether we are able to recover from the death of our Khan, elect a new Khan of All-Kazakhs, and continue the fight against the Russian bear, or if we will once again succumb to infighting amongst ourselves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY16;\n\nWe have emerged victorious! Kenesary Khan has defied the odds and secured our continued independence from the Russian Empire. All of Russia's forces have been push out of our lands even . Kenesary Khan's legitimacy is unquestioned and any remaining tribes of the three Jüz who still held Russian sympathies have either fallen in line or fled to Russia's remaining holdings in the Kazakh steppe. This does not spell the end for future Russian interference in Central Asia, not while they continue to hold onto our lands and oppress our people; we must use this setback in Russia's advance into Central Asia to focus on our enemies to the south and east and plan for the final liberation of our people. The Khanate endures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY17;\n\nWith the death of Kenesary Khan and our victory over Kazakh Khanate assured, the lands of the Middle and Junior Jüz are now properly destroyed and incorporated into our Empire as it should have been since we decreed their dissolution in 1824. While some of the territories Kenesary Khan had conquered from the Kokand Khanate has fallen back into their hands, we are now the sole masters over the Kazakh Steppe proper. Our relation with the Senior Jüz Kazakhs, who did not participate in the rebellion, has also returned to normal §Band we have been hearing talks of their willing annexation into our Empire§W; it remains to be seen if these talks lead to anything greater, though. §BPerhaps some increased presence and influence in the region may tip the scales in our favour§W. /nThe pacification of the Kazakh Steppe has been achieved for the foreseeable future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UCAJY;\n\nWith our conquests in Central Asia reaching its zenith, we are now the undisputed masters of even the most uninhabited portions of the Kara-Kum desert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARYKASIMOV;\n\nKenesary Kasimov has long been a thorn in our side. Son of Kasim Sultan and brother of Sarzhan Kasimov, he ascended to the throne of the Kazakh Khanate in 1841. He became infamous in 1837 after his forces captured and razed the fortress of Akmolinsk to the ground. He has continually raided caravans, besieged forts, and evaded attempts at capturing him. Additionally, he waged war on the Khanate of Kokand to the South of the Khanate, a sort of retreat from our advance in the North. Now, he has finally met is fate - at the hands of Kokand. Despite being whittled down to a force of but 500 men, he insisted on fighting on, never losing hope for an independent Kazakhstan. His death, the result of the betrayal of his forces' location by the Kyrgyz Omron Khan, renders Kazakh Khanate a snake without a head: With the last Khan dead, the Kazakhs are divided and leaderless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARYDEATH;\n\nKenesary Kasimov has been killed! Despite his skill and bravery in the battlefield, Russian forces with their advanced weapons and tactics have reduced our numbers to a meager fraction of what it once was. It had been decided to retreat our remaining forces to the mountainous region near Lake Balkhash to continue the struggle against the Russians in more favourable terrain when our troops were ambushed and captured by a Kyrgyz force who had defected to the Russians, their location having been given away by the Kyrgyz Omron Khan. After their capture, Kenesary Khan, along with Nauryzbai were swiftly executed. With the Khan dead, we are divided and leaderless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENIORZHUZ;\n\nWith the fall of the Middle Jüz, the remaining parts of the Kazakh Khanate, the Senior Jüz fell into decadence and wars with the Kyrgyz of the South, weakening further and increasingly seeking protection from us. While the various tribes of the Senior Jüz have always been more accepting of Russian influence in their lands, their distance from the Siberian frontiers had always made any type of formal annexation of their people unfeasible. Now that we have managed to extend our frontier south with the supprestion and integration of the Middle Jüz, we may now properly incorporate the Senior Jüz into the Russian Empire and end the sovereignty of the remaining Kazakh Jüzes once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENIORZHUZ2;\n\nOur increasing dependence on Russian protection has lead to them suggesting our formal annexation into the Russian Empire. The many tribes of the Senior Jüz have slowly warmed up to Russian influence throughout these past decades and many feel it is now the opportune time to apply for formal Russian citizenship, although this would undoubtably compromise our sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENIORZHUZ3;\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the Senior Jüz have recinded their petition of annexation! How should we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QINGNAYMAN;\n\nTroubles in the west between the Kazakhs and Russians have lead to the Nayman tribe of the Middle Jüz Kazakhs to seek protection from the Russians in our Empire. Who are we to deny sanctuary to those who are willing to bow before the true Son of Heaven?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN;\n\nBanbajan Fortress, built on our northernmost frontier on the left bank of the Syr Darya, has been captured and razed by the Kazakh warlord Zhankozha Nurmukhameduly! The fortress, dating to the past two decades, had been used as a staging point for exerting our influence and collecting tribute from the local Kazakhs as well as acting as a shield preventing incursions into the Syr Darya delta by the Khanate of Kokand. With the loss of this key fortress, our already shakey hold on our northern frontier has been completely shattered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN2;\n\nIn a daring land grab, the Khanate of Khiva has sent an army of 2000 soldiers to the Zhanaqala Fortress on the left bank of the Syr Darya across the river. Part of this detachment crossed to the right bank of the Syr Darya and ravaged the nomadic camps of Zhankozha Nurmukhamedov, plundering about 1000 families, capturing women and killing old people and children. Zhankozha and his detachment of 250 fled and swam across the Syr Darya and now petition S.E. Erofeev and Lieutenant P.S. Mertvago on-board the Schooner "Nikolai", one of the first Russian ships to sail the Aral Sea, to strike back against the Khivan forces who threaten to march and take Raimsk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN3;\n\nVictory has been achieved! Our strike against Zhankozha Nurmukhameduly's camp was not initially successful in capturing him, but luck was on our side as a small Russian have captured and delivered him to us! Apparently, he had approached the Russians and begged them to join him and his forces in attacking Zhanaqala Fortress. Thankfully the Russian garrison were not only reasonable in ignoring and delivering this nuisance to us, but have also evacuated the Raimsk Fortress in turn, showing their acceptance of our lordship over the whole of the Syr Darya delta. Things could not have gone any smoother for us! /nWith our control over the Syr Darya delta all but cemented, we can now look to expanding our horizons across the Aral Sea and up the Syr Darya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABAJAN4;\n\nCurses! While our raid of Zhankozha Nurmukhameduly's camp was successful, we were unable to capture or kill him. A day after his escape he and his host of 250 had returned along with a Russian warship that proceeded to fire on the Zhanaqala Fortress. While most of the garrison was able to flee, the majority of the loot and captives captured were taken back and the Fortress itself was completely destroyed! The destruction of Zhanaqala has emboldened the Russians to expand their influence into the left bank of the Syr Darya, the local Kazakhs fully accepting their rule without much resistance. Unfortunately, with the other troubles currently facing our nation, this loss spells the end of our dreams to dominate the coastal Aral Sea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHANKOZHA;\n\nThe colonization of the Aral Sea region by us had already started by 1845, but mass discontent with our newly established regime has only just recently begun. The Syr Darya Kazakhs have rebelled! The reason for which was the confiscation of some land from the local population. The uprising is led by Zhankozha Nurmukhamedov, who expressed his unwillingness to submit to the protege of the imperial court, Sultan Arslan Dzhantorin. The resistance of the Syr Darya Kazakhs under the leadership of Zhankozha is also joined by the surviving participants of the Kenesary uprising who are still bitter about their defeat a decade prior. The rebels are centered in the Zhanakala fortress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ESET;\n\nThe Alimuly Kazakhs are in open rebellion! High taxation on the local populace used to fund our continued expansion into the Kazakh Steppe has stressed our relations with the Kazakhs of the Junior Jüz to the point of revolt. The uprising is led by Eset Kotibaruli, who as put forward a number of demands: The removal of tax for households, the termination of punitive expeditions to the Kazakh Steppe, the allowing of usage of pastures, and the possibility to move into the banks of Rivers Zhem, Mugadzhar, Elek, Kobda, and Zhayyk. The resistance of the Alimuly Kazakhs under the leadership of Eset comes right at the tailend of the Kenesary rebellion and is sure to spiral out of control if we don't act fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
URALTURGAY;\n\nLarge swathes of the Ural and Turgai Oblasts have risen up in revolt! An implied increase in taxation regarding provisional regulations on the management of the Kazakh Steppe regions along with the restriction of the rights of the Muslim clergy and local Sultans and fundamental changes in the socio-spiritual sphere of society have angered the local populace. The Kazakhs have refused to submit to the tsarist administration, pay taxes, and do not allow commissions to carry out reforms into their villages. The Orenburg Governor-General has been informed that local tribes have elected their leaders - Bergen Kospanov, Seil Turkebaev, Kuspay Aibasov, Mambetali and Kanali Aryslanuly - to lead independent power in the regions. The rebel detachments have concentrated in the area of Lake Chelkar, the Taipak, Ulenti, Shiderty, and Ankaty tracts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADAI;\n\nAfter the hostile reaction and subsequent suppression of the local Kazakh populace in the Ural and Turgai Oblasts, the provisional regulations on the management of the Kazakh Steppe regions have expanded to also encompass the area of the Mangyshlak Peninsula held by the Adai clan of the Junior Jüz. While preventative measures had been taken to ensure an uprising as disruptive as the one in the years prior do not occur, unrest has nevertheless expanded into open revolt as a small rebel group lead by influential members of the Adai clan - Isa Tlenbaev, Dosan Tazhiev, Algi Zhalmambetov, and others - have refused to accept the new regulations and wage war against the central government of the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZCLEANUP;\n\nWe have managed to push back the Kokandi army back to the Ferghana Valley and retain our independence! This calls for celebration! A new Kyrgyz Khanate can now be established!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOKQNGTREATY;\n\nOutnumbered and outplanned, our righteous Holy War against the Chinese was perhaps doomed from the start. Following the barbaric execution of Jahangir Khoja, many of his followers in Kashgaria dispersed, making a prolonged war against the Qing impossible to sustain.\n\nDespite this, our courage and prowess seems to have frightened the Dragon Throne to the core, and they have approached us with the intent of establishing cordial relations between our states. Their offer includes pardoning those who fought alongside us in Kashgaria, and most importantly, the position of being their preferred trade partner in Central Asia. While wary of rubbing shoulders with infidels, Madali Khan graciously accepted the agreement, aware of the riches it would bring to his Khanate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QINGZHETYSU;\n\nAs we have managed to extend our control west over the entirety of the Generalship of Ili, we are in a position to formalize a border with the Kazakhs of the Middle Jüz. In exchange for the far west grazinglands of the lower Shu River, we gain control over our traditional claims over Lebushi and its surrounding territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QINGZHETYSU2;\n\nAfter a period of rapid expansion into the Zhetysu region, an envoy from China has arrived detailing the establishment of a formal border between our two peoples. The resulting border would have us lose control over the grazing lands currently inhabited by the Eastern Nayman tribe, but would also grant us a claim over the tribes of the Senior Jüz not under Chinese rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZRAIDS;The continued existence of the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate has lead to an increase of hostile raids on our borders. Our poor relations with the Kyrgyz may be to blame for their hostility towards us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KYRGYZRAIDS2;Recent raids against our neighbours have brought back a great deal of wealth and prestige for the Khanate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG1;\n\nTrouble brews in the west! The conquest of the Khanate of Kokand at the hands of the recently revived Kazakh Khanate has brought unwelcome disruption to the stability and trade networks of our western frontier. Kokand, a favoured trading partner of ours, served a vital link between the Celestial Empire and the commercce of Central Asia. Now, with Kazakh banners flying over the fertile Ferghana Valley and its cities, our court must consider the new order.\nThe Imperial Diet advises that the Khanate be made to pay tribute to the Empire and formally recognize the supreme authority of the Son of Heaven in compensation for the interruption of trade. In return, the Kazakh Khan may be acknowledged as the rightful ruler of his people and reaffirmed as the Shah of Turan -a title our realm once granted to the last Kazakh Khan, Ablai Khan, many years ago. Such recognition would also be followed by the formalization of our border with the Kazakhs, granting them lands inhabited by Kazakhs in exchange for strategic holdings in the Eastern Pamir mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG2;\n\nThe conquest of Kokand has finally attracted the attention of the Chinese Empire. The arrival of an Imperial envoy has stirred deep debate among our elders and warriors alike. They demand compensation for our disruption of trade in the area as a consequence of our campaign against the Khanate of Kokand in the form of tribute, along with our symbolic acknowledgment of the supreme authority of the Chinese Emperor -a bitter price, for it wounds our pride and places the Steppe beneath the eyes of a new foreign entity. Yet this visit also come to us as an offer of peace and stability: In return for our submission, they offer to recognize our Khan as the rightful ruler of the Kazakhs and the Shah of Turan -a title once bestowed upon the great Ablai Khan himself. This deal would also settle our frontiers with the Chinese, granting them their claims in the Eastern Pamir mountains in exchange for recognizing our sovereignty over all Kazakh lands held by the Empire.\nWhile acceptance may be difficult, to refuse is to invite war with the vast realms of China, a force of immense strength and order. While victory would certainly propel our fledgling nation to heights never before seen in our history, to lose could threaten our people's hard fought survival to its very core.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG3;\n\nThe Kazakh barbarians, blinded by arrogance and emboldened by their recent victories, have spurned the Middle Kingdom's gracious offer. Instead of humility, they chose defiance. Instead of friendship, they embrace insolence. Such betrayal of harmony cannot be tolerated. Our banners now move towards the Kazakh Steppe to restore balance, to discipline the ungrateful, and to remind all who exist between Heaven and Earth that the grace of the Dragon Throne is matched only by its power.\nAs it was with the Dzungars, who once defied the Middle Kingdom and were sweapt away by our righteous fury, so too shall it be with these Kazakh upstarts. Let them know what became of those who mistake leniency for weakness -entire nations erased, their banners burned, and their lands brought under the Son of Heaven's mandated domains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG4;\n\nAgainst all odds and to the astonishment of many, our great Khanate has added a mighty crack to the crumbling facade of Chinese invincibility, Their legions, once thought as endless as the sky and powerful as the heavens, lie broken, scattered across the wind-swept plains of old Dzungaria. Our riders now thunder through the great cities of the western frontier -Tsarkent, Kulja, Kashgar, Urumtsi- where Chinese banners have been torn down and replaced with the proud standards of the Kazakh army. The Eemperor, once distant and untouchable, at the behest of his court now sues for peace, humbled by the fury of the Steppe.\nAnd before the Khan lies a choice heavy with destiny: shall we only claim the lands settled by our kin and solidify the heart of our nation? Shall we press onwards into Altishar, ancient cradle of empires, where jade and blood flow freely, or conquer it entirely? Or shall we seize the full domains of the accursed Dzungar Khanate, not as looters, but as rightful conquerors and carve an imperial legacy from the bones of the old not seen since the days of Chagatai Khan?\nThe wind sings with prophecy, and the steppe waits for the Khan's word to echo across all of Central Asia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAZQNG4;\n\nThe wild Kazakh Steppe, once filled with boastful cries of defiance and delusions of grandeur, now lies broken and humbled beneath the might of the Middle Kingdom. The Khanate, in its arrogance, dared not only to reject the gracious hand of peace extended by the Son of Heaven but to also raise its hand in defiance -and for that insolence, they have paid dearly. Their riders, once so proud, flee before the thunder of Chinese arms and the unyielding advance of Imperial armies. Their primitive strongholds lie in ruin, their Khan brought low. Order has triumphed over disharmony.\nNow, with victory secured, the Emperor must decide the fate of this unruly frontier. Shall we impose once more the original terms between our peoples -peace through submission, tribute, and recognition of Imperial supremacy? Or shall we press farther, extending defacto authority into the fertile Zhetysu Valley, long claimed by right of conquest over the Dzungars, while restoring the Kokand Khanate as a loyal trader partner and overseer of order in the region? Or perhaps the time has come to dissolve the Kazakh Khanate entirely, scattering its clans and placing all the Steppe under Imperial governance, as it was for the Dzungars who came before and as is a fitting fate for those who defy Heaven.\nThe Dragon has stirred -and the world will remember who commands the winds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAZARAAUTONOMY;\n\nDespite fierce resistance, our occupation of the Hazarajat can finally come to an end as the tribes of the area have agreed to acknowledge our suzerainty over the whole of the Hazarajat in exchange for autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But through a string of losses against them in near memory, Kokand faltered under pressure. Rather than continue to resis alongside us, they chose cowardice and betrayal. Their fear turned to treachery when they struck against our people, culminating in the brutal murders of the family of Kenesary Qasymuly - Brothers, wives, and children - This act of cruelty has cannot go unanswered as now, the Kazakh banners gather for war against the traitorous Kokand! Yet we know §Bsuch a campaign will not go unnoticed by the Chinese§W who favour Kokand for their trade. If we do not act in a diplomatic manner in the aftermath of our righteous war, §Rwe may find ourselves facing the might of another great Empire.§W The Kazakh Steppe has not forgotten its pride, nor will it suffer betrayal without vengeance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
