AUSTINFOUNDING;The Founding of Austin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUSTINFOUNDINGDESC;\n\nA small pioneer settlement situated on the Colorado River in central Texas has been chosen as the republic's seventh and final capital. Incorporated under the name Waterloo, the town has been renamed Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NINKODEATH;The Death of Emperor Ninko;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NINKODEATH2;\n\nEmperor Ninko, the 120th Emperor of Japan, has passed away. Ninko's reign has spanned from 1817 to 1846, seeing further deterioration of the power of the ruling Shogun. Disasters, including famine, combined with corruption and increasing Western interference, have helped to erode public trust in the bakufu government. It is hard to say what role, if any, the Emperor had in the turmoil which occurred during his reign, as Japan is ruled by the shogun and an emperor's role is primarily ceremonial. He has been enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, Nochi no Tsukinowa no Higashiyama no misasagi. Prince Osahito, Emperor Ninko's fourth son, has now assumed the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH;The Death of Francis I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH2;\n\nBorn in 1777, Francis I, who ascended to the throne in 1825, has passed away today at the age of 53. He pursued a course of conservatism during his reign. He only rarely took part in the government, which he left in the hands of his favorites and police officials. Thus, the king lived with his mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of assassination. During his reign, the only revolutionary movements to erupt were the Cilento Riots of 1828. After a lengthy period of illness, King Francis entered a period of delirium before finally passing away. In his final moments, plagued by hallucinations of a revolution, he hysterically cried out: "What are these voices? The people want a constitution? Give it to them!" He is succeeded by his son to his second wife, Ferdinand II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH;The Death of Charles Felix;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH2;\n\nBorn in 1765 and crowned King of Sardinia in 1821, Charles Felix has passed away today at the age of 66. He was the last male-line member of the House of Savoy, leaving the throne to his distant cousin Charles Albert of Savoy-Carignano, regent of Sardinia. His rule began with the abdication of his father, Victor Emmanuel I to Liberal Revolutionaries in 1821. He was regarded as a true reactionary, and was rarely present in Turin as king, having no particular affection for the Turinese due to the prior revolution. He tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior, reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterised by Massimo d'Azeglio, a prominent statesman, as "a despotism full of straight and honest intentions but its representatives and arbiters were four old chamberlains, four old maids of honour, with a hive of friars, priests, monks, and jesuits.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH;The Death of Emperor Meiji;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH2;\n\nEmperor Mutsuhito, better known by his regnal name Meiji, has died today after a period of publicized suffering. With the death of the Emperor of Japan, the Meiji Era closes, -- a period which stands out in the long history of Japan as the most illustrious and most enlightened and represents an evolution and progress unequalled in a similar time in the history of any other nation. It has witnessed the transformation of Japan from a hermit island empire, under provincial feudal rule, to a world power of the first class. It has been an era of glorious victories, and, above all, of unparalleled advancement. The death of His Majesty Mutsuhito, in the 60th year of his life and the 44th year of his reign, will doubtless have a very far reaching effect upon the peoples and politics of Asia if not upon those of the entire world. For it was during his august reign that Japan not only opened her gates to the peoples and commerce of the world, but fairly entered into the comity of nations. The late Mutsuhito will be succeeded to the throne by his son Yoshihito, his Majesty the new Emperor, who was married in 1900 to the Princess Sadako and has a son and heir, the Prince Hirohito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELBEFLOOD1845;\n\nA severe winter hitting the country has caused an ice dam to form on the river Elbe, trapping the water behind it. A sudden thaw, which resulted in heavy snow melting in the German low mountain ranges and the rapid break-up of the frozen Elbe, has triggered the flood. When the dam finally gave way to the mass of water, it took a substantial part of the dike flanking the river with it. The water has now flooded into the valley along the river, destroying many homes and farms from northern Bohemia to Anhalt in the process. The city of Dresden has been hit particularly hard by the flooding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
propagandaphi;\n\nA movement has recently sprung up in the Phillipines encompassing the activities of a group of Filipinos who calls for political reforms in their lands that we control, producing books, leaflets, and newspaper articles to educate others about their goals and supposed issues they are trying to solve. The Propagandists aims include representation in the parliment, secularization of the clergy, the guarantee of basic civil freedoms, The abolishment of labor services and the forced sale of local products to the government, and legal equality for the native Filipinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ast_capital_title;The Capital Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ast_capital_desc;\n\nA heated debate has sprung up in parliment regarding potential locations of the capital of Australia. Due to the recent gold rush in Victoria, Melbourne is now Australia's largest city and a suitable place for the capital. However Sydney, rival city to Melbourne, is Australia's oldest, and so also has a justifiable claim to host the new nation's Federal polity. To select one city would certainly anger the populace in the other as the Sydney–Melbourne rivalry is such that neither city would never agree to the other one becoming the capital. As such, a political compromise has also been suggested: A new capital, Canberra, is to be built somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne in the larger state of New South Wales, so long as it was at least 160km from Sydney. This option would help prevent a rise in tensions in either city at the cost of developing a new city from the ground up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alexandropol_title;Nicholas I's visit to Gyumri;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alexandropol_desc;\n\nEver since our nation's victory over the Qajar Empire in The Second Russo-Persian war, Gyumri has become one of the many developing cities in the Transcaucasus, bolstered further by the influx of around 3,000 Armenian families from numerous Ottoman cities on our border in the aftermath of the 1829 Russo-Turkish War. During a recent visit to Gyumri, Tsar Nicholas has passed a decree to rename the city to Alexandropol, in honour of his wife, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, who has changed her name to Alexandra Fyodorovna after converting to Orthodox Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CASPIAN1;\n\nAs our control over the nothern coast solidifies, we are able to project more and more power southwards down the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea. While the land is relatively desolate comparted to the southern and western coast, mainly consisting of dry deserts in the north and mountains in the south populated by nomadic Turkmen and Kazakhs, a small foothold in the region will be useful in our attempt to increase our regional power projection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AKMECHETLOSS;\n\nWith our control over the city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan lost, it has become impossible for us to supply and maintain our line of forts along the Syr-Darya river, including the key fortress of Ak-Mechet. The territory now rests in the hands of the local Kazakh nomads belonging to the Middle Jüz. We can only hope this turn of events is only a temporary set-back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AKMECHETGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Kokand having lost the key city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan, they can no longer defend it. We will therefore take it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUGAIN;\n\nWith the Khan of Kokand busy dealing with a massive Kyrgyz revolt to their north-east, they have become unable to defend their holdings along the Shu and Syr Darya Rivers, including the our former capital of Turkistan. Kenesary, with the help of the his two brother-Khans and their younger cousin, Aziz id-Din Bahadur, son of Nauryzbai Bahadur, has gathered a large troop of well-trained Kazakhs to capture these key fortresses along the Syr Darya in the name of bolstering our forces against the Russian menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUGAIN2;\n\nLike vultures, they have decended on us! As we deal with war to our north and south, a large troop of Kazakhs led by Kenesary Khan and his generals have swiftly taken our lands surrounding the Syr Darya and Shu Rivers up to the important city of Hazrat-i-Turkistan. \n\nThis loss is yet another stain on the young Madali Khan's legacy and failing to meet these Kazakh invaders in battle would further exacerbate this, but perhaps it would be wiser to focus our limited resources on ending our current conflicts instead of starting new ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHIVAMERVINVASION;\n\nThe Turkmen of the Karakum Desert have historically bent the knee to the Khivan Khan, paying taxes in the form of Zakat and tribute. Recently, our grip over the Turkmen has loosed and it falls to Allah Quli Khan to reestablish Khivan authority in the region, focusing on the Merv Oasis in the southeast, and the Sariq Turkmens located there, and the frontier lands of Sarakhs bordering the Persians, along with the Akhal Turkmen who reside there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHIVAMERVINVASIONTKM;\n\nThe Khan of Khiva, Allah Quli Khan, in his infinite greed and foolishness has levied a mighty army and marches it towards Sarakhs, having already taken the Merv Oasis and its neighbouring lands. It falls to us, the Teke Tribe, to resist this mad Khan and his foolhardy attempt to expand his influence in our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS1;\n\nIn an effort to make up for his defeats in the Second Russo-Persians War and bolster his claim to the throne, Abbas Mirza has invaded the areas east and northeast of Mashhad, taking control of the notable settlments of Khabushan, Torbat-e Heydarieh, and Sarakhs, solidifying our control over Khorasan and allowing us to properly push our claims over southern Turkmenia. The latter city of Sarakhs having been recently conquered by the Khanate of Khiva, has been quickly taken from the Khivans before proper control could be established. Abbas Mirza's poor health means this could very well be the final conflict he personally leads as he takes a step back and waits for the eventual passing of this father, Fath-Ali Shah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS2;\n\nFollowing our victory over the Teke Turkmen in the south, a Persian army, led by the Qajar heir-apparent Abbas Mirza, has used the opportunity to swiftly seize the border city of Sarakhs! Shall we launch a counter invasion of the territory and punish the Persians for their transgression? While Sarakhs is a notable settlment in northern Khorasan, it lays at the edge of our southern frontier and may not be worth going to war against the Persians over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS3;\n\nIn retaliation to our seizure of Sarakhs, Allah Quli Khan has launched a large-scale invasion of our northern border. This has escalated what should have been a minor shifting of the border into a larger conflict. We must use this opportunity to push our claims over the Merv Oasis and establish a distant frontier from the Khorasani heartland. May Allah grant us certain victory against the Khivan Horde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ABBASMIRZASARAKHS4;\n\nWe are victorious over the weak Qajar Dynasty. The remaining lands in Northern Khorasan and the Turkmen Sahra are ours for the taking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY1;\n\nThroughout the past century, our northern neighbour has continued their efforts in increasing their influence over our lands. As the Russian Empire penetrate deeper and deeper into Kazakh lands, Kenesary Qasymuly, grandson of Ablai Khan and notable detractor of the Russians, has gathered many local nobles of the Junior, Middle, and Senior Jüz and formalized a mutual pact in opposition to the Russians and their expansion south. Kenesary's rise to power is sure to upset the current Russian-backed status-quo. May this be the beginning of a new Kazakh golden age!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY2;\n\nThe Kazakh people have long since held a position of protectorate of the Russian Empire, yet any actual control over the Kazakh Steppes has proven difficult to come by. A century's worth of fortification construction and pacification has led to only the edges of these lands falling into line as the interior continues to be governed by local clans and tribes. And yet, our accelerating pacification of the Steppes, largely due in part to our superior technology and tactics, have startled the local populace enough for them to rally around the leadership of a Kenesary Kasimov, grandson of the last Kazakh Khan, Ablai Khan. His presence has disrupted our nominal overlordship over the Kazakhs but has yet to escalate into anything larger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY3;\n\nA Kurultay has been convened, Kenesary Khan has been elected as the Khan of all Kazakhs, a title not in use since the death of Ablai Khan, Kenesary's grandfather, 40 years ago. The three Jüz are finally reunited after all this time and a horde of twenty thousand has been levied to resist the Russians to the north and the Uzbeks to the south. The Khanate must not fall, the Khanate will not fall! \n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY4;\n\nThe upstart Kenesary Kasimov has united the disparate Kazakh clans and reunited the thought-to-be-dead Kazakh Khanate. Kenesary Khan's coronation has lit a fire under our Kazakh subjects as he sets his sights on the our lands in Central Asia. It is unknown if he will continue with the small-scale assaults and caravan raids as he has done up until now, but it is in our best interest to mobilize a force on our borders in anticipation of any movement from his horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY5;\n\nThe upstart Kenesary Kasimov has made his first move against us. Kenesary's military operations began in the spring with the siege of Akmolinsk fortress. The garrison commander of the fortress, Ivan Karbyshev, and the Senior Sultan of the Akmolinsk district, Konyrkulzha Kudaymendin barely managed to escape the burned fortress. The rebel army now marches back to Turgay, where Kenesary aims to extend the revolt to the lands of the Junior Jüz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY6;\n\nAkmolinsk Prikaz was well protected. Deep ditches were dug in the district, all nearby approaches were blocked. The Akmolinsk Prikaz was guarded by the troops of the Russian puppet Konurkuldzha Kudaimendin and the garrison of the fortress, led by the Ivan Karbyshev. The offensive of Kenesary's troops began at dawn. Kazakh archers fired at the fortress with bows, attaching flammable tarred rags to the arrowheads. Numerous fires broke out in the fortress. At that moment, when part of the garrison rushed to fight the fire, one of the detachments of Kenesary, despite the heavy fire, broke the enemy resistance and penetrated the fortification. \nThe next day, the ruined fortress was still on fire, its destruction, now clearly visible in the daylight. \nKenesary Khan's attack on the Russian fortress of Akmolinsk has been successful! The liberation of our people is nigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

KENESARY13;\n\nIt was too good to be true... \n\nDespite our miraculous victory over the Russian Empire, without a leader, the now scattered and aimless Kazakh tribes have once again divided themselves along clan lines. Only time will tell if another Khan of All-Kazakhs will emerge from our disunified peoples, and raise the Kazakh banner across the steppe once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARY14;\n\nWith the future of the Kazakh steppe uncertain, from where might the winds of fortune blow next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UCAJY;\n\nWith our conquests in Central Asia reaching its zenith, we are now the undisputed masters of even the most uninhabited portions of the Kara-Kum desert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARYKASIMOV;\n\nKenesary Kasimov has long been a thorn in our side. Son of Kasym Khan and brother of Sarzhan Khan, he ascended to the throne of the Kazakh Khanate in 1841. He became infamous in 1837 after his forces captured and razed the fortress of Akmolinsk to the ground. He has continually raided caravans, besieged forts, and evaded attempts at capturing him. Additionally, he waged war on the Khanate of Kokand to the South of the Khanate, a sort of retreat from our advance in the North. Now, he has finally met is fate - at the hands of Kokand. Despite being whittled down to a force of but 500 men, he insisted on fighting on, never losing hope for an independent Kazakhstan. His death, the result of the betrayal of his forces' location by the Kyrgyz Omron Khan, renders Kazakh Khanate a snake without a head: With the last Khan dead, the Kazakhs are divided and leaderless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARYDEATH;\n\nKenesary Kasimov has been killed! Despite his skill and bravery in the battlefield, Russian forces with their advanced weapons and tactics have reduced our numbers to a meager fraction of what it once was. It had been decided to retreat our remaining forces to the mountainous region near Lake Balkhash to continue the struggle against the Russians in more favourable terrain when our troops were ambushed and captured by a Kyrgyz force who had defected to the Russians, their location having been given away by the Kyrgyz Omron Khan. After their capture, Kenesary Khan, along with Nauryzbai were swiftly executed. With the Khan dead, we are divided and leaderless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENIORZHUZ;\n\nWith the fall of the Middle Jüz, the remaining parts of the Kazakh Khanate, the Senior Jüz fell into decadence and wars with the Kyrgyz of the South, weakening further and becoming a great target for expansion. With this opportunity, we must prepare for a quick war to end the sovereignty of the Kazakh Jüzes once and for all, and while we're at it, we could get some Kyrgyz land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
