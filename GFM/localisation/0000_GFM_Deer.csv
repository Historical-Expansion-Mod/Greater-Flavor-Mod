NINKODEATH;The Death of Emperor Ninko;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NINKODEATH2;Emperor Ninko, the 120th Emperor of Japan, has passed away. Ninko's reign has spanned from 1817 to 1846, seeing further deterioration of the power of the ruling Shogun. Disasters, including famine, combined with corruption and increasing Western interference, have helped to erode public trust in the bakufu government. It is hard to say what role, if any, the Emperor had in the turmoil which occurred during his reign, as Japan is ruled by the shogun and an emperor's role is primarily ceremonial. He has been enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, Nochi no Tsukinowa no Higashiyama no misasagi. Prince Osahito, Emperor Ninko's fourth son, has now assumed the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH;The Death of Francis I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCISIDEATH2;Born in 1777, Francis I, who ascended to the throne in 1825, has passed away today at the age of 53. He pursued a course of conservatism during his reign. He only rarely took part in the government, which he left in the hands of his favorites and police officials. Thus, the king lived with his mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of assassination. During his reign, the only revolutionary movements to erupt were the Cilento Riots of 1828. After a lengthy period of illness, King Francis entered a period of delirium before finally passing away. In his final moments, plagued by hallucinations of a revolution, he hysterically cried out: "What are these voices? The people want a constitution? Give it to them!" He is succeeded by his son to his second wife, Ferdinand II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH;The Death of Charles Felix;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FELIXCHARLESDEATH2;Born in 1765 and crowned King of Sardinia in 1821, Charles Felix has passed away today at the age of 66. He was the last male-line member of the House of Savoy, leaving the throne to his distant cousin Charles Albert of Savoy-Carignano, regent of Sardinia. His rule began with the abdication of his father, Victor Emmanuel I to Liberal Revolutionaries in 1821. He was regarded as a true reactionary, and was rarely present in Turin as king, having no particular affection for the Turinese due to the prior revolution. He tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior, reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterised by Massimo d'Azeglio, a prominent statesman, as "a despotism full of straight and honest intentions but its representatives and arbiters were four old chamberlains, four old maids of honour, with a hive of friars, priests, monks, and jesuits.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH;The Death of Emperor Meiji;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEIJIDEATH2;Emperor Mutsuhito, better known by his regnal name Meiji, has died today after a period of publicized suffering. With the death of the Emperor of Japan, the Meiji Era closes, -- a period which stands out in the long history of Japan as the most illustrious and most enlightened and represents an evolution and progress unequalled in a similar time in the history of any other nation. It has witnessed the transformation of Japan from a hermit island empire, under provincial feudal rule, to a world power of the first class. It has been an era of glorious victories, and, above all, of unparalleled advancement. The death of His Majesty Mutsuhito, in the 60th year of his life and the 44th year of his reign, will doubtless have a very far reaching effect upon the peoples and politics of Asia if not upon those of the entire world. For it was during his august reign that Japan not only opened her gates to the peoples and commerce of the world, but fairly entered into the comity of nations. The late Mutsuhito will be succeeded to the throne by his son Yoshihito, his Majesty the new Emperor, who was married in 1900 to the Princess Sadako and has a son and heir, the Prince Hirohito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELBEFLOOD1845;A severe winter hitting the country has caused an ice dam to form on the river Elbe, trapping the water behind it. A sudden thaw, which resulted in heavy snow melting in the German low mountain ranges and the rapid break-up of the frozen Elbe, has triggered the flood. When the dam finally gave way to the mass of water, it took a substantial part of the dike flanking the river with it. The water has now flooded into the valley along the river, destroying many homes and farms from northern Bohemia to Anhalt in the process. The city of Dresden has been hit particularly hard by the flooding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
propagandaphi;A movement has recently sprung up in the Philippines encompassing the activities of a group of Filipinos who call for political reforms in their lands that we control, producing books, leaflets, and newspaper articles to educate others about their goals and supposed issues they are trying to solve. The Propagandists' aims include representation in the parliment, secularization of the clergy, the guarantee of basic civil freedoms, The abolishment of labor services and the forced sale of local products to the government, and legal equality for the native Filipinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ast_capital_title;The Capital Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ast_capital_desc;A heated debate has sprung up in parliment regarding potential locations of the capital of Australia. Due to the recent gold rush in Victoria, Melbourne is now Australia's largest city and a suitable place for the capital. However Sydney, rival city to Melbourne, is Australia's oldest, and so also has a justifiable claim to host the new nation's Federal polity. To select one city would certainly anger the populace in the other as the Sydneyâ€“Melbourne rivalry is such that neither city would never agree to the other one becoming the capital. As such, a political compromise has also been suggested: A new capital, Canberra, is to be built somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne in the larger state of New South Wales, so long as it was at least 160km from Sydney. This option would help prevent a rise in tensions in either city at the cost of developing a new city from the ground up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alexandropol_title;Nicholas I's visit to Gyumri;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alexandropol_desc;Ever since our nation's victory over the Qajar Empire in The Second Russo-Persian war, Gyumri has become one of the many developing cities in the Transcaucasus, bolstered further by the influx of around 3,000 Armenian families from numerous Ottoman cities on our border in the aftermath of the 1829 Russo-Turkish War. During a recent visit to Gyumri, Tsar Nicholas has passed a decree to rename the city to Alexandropol, in honour of his wife, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, who has changed her name to Alexandra Fyodorovna after converting to Orthodox Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
