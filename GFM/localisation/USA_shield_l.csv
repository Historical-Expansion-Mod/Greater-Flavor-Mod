USA_CAN_Expansion_desc;§RGain 20 infamy§! Congressman Nathaniel Prentice Banks has presented us with an opportunity, a bill that provides the president the authorization to take control of the states of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Canada East, Canada West, the Territories of Selkirk, Saskatchewan, and Columbia. However, a failure to take these territories will result in immense consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_CAN_Expansion_title;The Annexation Bill of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_CAN_denied_title;The Treaty of Ottawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_CAN_denied_desc;British and Canadian troops have successfully defended the 50th Parallel, and the onslaught of American militiamen has been thrown back. With the war over, it is time to clip the Eagle's wings and redraw the borders of North America to ensure lasting peace in the New World. We welcome the American diplomats into Ottawa so they might behold what they will never have. All the Oregon Territory will be returned to British hands, and several northern US territories along with the state of Michigan will be transferred to the Dominion of Canada. Also, the Treaty calls for the formation of a new and independent, under British supervision of course, Republic of New England composed of several north-eastern states. With all these measures in place, British interest in the New World shall never again be threatened by the rabble of uncivilized men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_CAN_achieved_title;The Treaty of Philadelphia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_CAN_achieved_desc;After terrible fighting across the Americas, the virtuous patriots of Liberty have triumphed over the wicked tyrants of the Old World. In cities throughout the country, banners of red, white, and blue are raised to celebrate the induction of Canada into the Union. Patriotism is a fever pitch as delegates in Philadelphia sign a treaty which banishes the United Kingdom from the Americas. Any British colonial possessions are transferred to the United States so that the damages done to them during their time under Royalist oppression might be repaired. A new and beautiful day is dawning, as majestic American Eagle spreads his mighty wings over the American continents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRA_USA_QUE_title;Attempt to Purchase Quebec from the Americans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRA_USA_QUE_desc;Relations between the France and the United States have always been rather cordial ever since the days of Lafayette. With Quebec now in their hands after the so-called Crusader for Canada, the Americans may be more willing to negotiate with France over returning Quebec back to its rightful rulers. Surely the Americans of all people will understand how important it is to undo the damage done by the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_french_title;The Quebec Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_french_desc;After the liberation of Quebec, the issue on what to do with the French speaking population needs to be resolved. Should they be given home rule or should they be integrated into the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_canadian_title;Integrate the Canadians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_canadian_desc;Sadly while the United States achieved independence in 1776, our Canadian brothers to the north remained under subjugation. Finally, the Canadians can be integrated into this great Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72749;There seems to be no end to American aggression. First, they seize Oregon, and now their so called Manifest Destiny calls for all the Great White North to be in their hands. Diplomacy with these fanatics is useless and who knows what else those war hawks in Washington are planning. To secure the Canadian frontier from the American menace, all colonial dominions must come under direct rule from London.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72748;All is quiet on the Northern Frontier as the blood of the fallen stains red the snow of Canada. John Quincy Adam once said the United States does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy, and yet how foolish are we for bringing the beast to our very doorstep. The War Hawks in Washington promised to bring the American people to glory, but instead have brought disaster upon this great nation. Not only does Canada remain under British rule, but now several of the United States northern territories along with our gains from the Oregon Wars have been lost. To make matters worse, the New England states including New York have become another puppet state of the imperial crown. Riots against the statesman in the District Colombia for their ignorance are bound to break out. This will be a day that forever haunts the American spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72740;What an embarrassing day for Empire of Great Britain. Truly we are the laughing stock of Europe for being beaten so badly by our former subjects. Not only has America seized everything north of the 50th Parallel, but they have also taken all British territories in the Caribbean and South America. The Treaty of Philadelphia has also resulted British spheres of influenced in the New World being expelled and replaced with the United States. The British crown has been dented by this defeat and our international reputation is severely stained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72738;After the Crusade for Canada, great swaths of lands came under American control. Both Anglo and French Canadians were liberated thanks the Treaty of Philadelphia. France has recently offered to purchase Quebec from us citing cultural bonds and the need to undo the wrongs of the British Empire done against French Canadians. Some in Washington are in favor of such a deal believing that America is an Anglo nation that French Canadians could never integrate in. There is also the fact the French are currently offering a large sum in exchange for Quebec and America is always in need of more funds. Others argue it would be wrong to transfer Quebec to France without first ensuring French Canadians have a right to home rule even if France would not likely pay the full price currently on the table. Many are adamant that to sell American lands to European powers is an offense to the patriots who died for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC93744;While the French-Canadians share our colonial spirit and history, their culture and language is unique from the rest of Anglo Protestant nation. The question there for arises what is to be done with them? Should we attempt to integrate them, or would it be better off for them to have autonomy in the Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

shield_NW_title;The Shield of the New World;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shield_NW_desc;§RGain 10 infamy§! In 1823, the United States adopted the Monroe Doctrine to safeguard the infant revolutions in the Americas from European aggression. However, we cannot continue to ignore the cries of the oppressed that still suffer under the rule of tyrants. It is time the United States fulfill its divine duty to be a Shield for Democracy in the New World. The Imperialist have been banished from Canada, now let us clean up the rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NW_hegemony_title;Declare American Hegemony Over the New World;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NW_hegemony_desc;Foreign powers have been successfully banished and the New World is now firmly under the protection of the United States. It is time to begin the process of reorganizing the American nations to strengthen themselves against threats from across the oceans so that they might never be oppressed again. As long as the United States maintains the principles of democracy and liberty, then the continents of the New World will remain safe and be able to prosper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
outside_form_FRCA_title;Reunite Central America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
outside_form_FRCA_desc;The states of Central America were once reunited under one flag, but the flag burned as quickly as it was raised. Although Central America was not state under the Federal Republic, it is not any better for it to separated into small and bickering countries. With American supervision and support, the Federal Republic can be reborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_monarch_title;Question of the Mexican Monarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_monarch_desc;Although European powers have been expelled from the New World, the traces of their monarchical ideals still linger. Most concerning of which is the Mexican Empire that sits on our southern borders. A decision must be reached on how the United States should deal with this sensitive issue and whether action should be taken on Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUC_MMwar_title;Incite a Revolt in the Yucatan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUC_MMwar_desc;In order to pull Mexican troops away from our borders, we can incite a revolt among the rebellious Mayans of the Yucatan peninsula. Our troops in the region can arm the local populace to take up arms against their rulers in Mexico City. Although rebellions are expensive things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUA_MMWar_title;Seize Tapachula;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUA_MMWar_desc;§RGain 1 infamy§! The chaos in the Yucatan has separated Tapachula from the rest of Mexico allowing us an opportunity to take land that is rightfully ours. We might be invaded for it, but that is a risk we must take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_CRB_USA_title;Unite the Caribbean States;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_CRB_USA_desc;The small islands of the Caribbean are a diverse collection of varying languages and nationalities with a complicated history of colonization. As different as these peoples are perhaps the United States can unite both the Greater and Lesser Antilles under one flag of common democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LSK_form_title;The Future of Alaska;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LSK_form_desc;The United States has successfully seized Alaska, but arguments have erupted on what to do with the barren land up north. The obvious answer is to continue to hold Alaska and develop the land, but there are some how says that to do so would be imperialistic. A decision must be reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
andean_congress_title;The Andean Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
andean_congress_desc;After centralizing our authority in North America, we can move on to reorganizing and strengthening the states of South America. The forming of two unions along the Andean Mountain range is our boldest plan yet. To the north, Simon Bolivar's dream of Gran Colombia will be brought back to life and to the south the once despotic Peru-Bolivian Confederation will be reformed into a democratic state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHL_andean_title;Join Chile to the Andes Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHL_andean_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§W Although this might be considered a radical idea by some, it is necessary that Chile be joined with the Andes Federation to ensure that the whole mountain range is under our control and supervision. The United States will dispatch our intentions the Chilean government, but we have no way of knowing if they will agree to such a union. It is the hope of everyone that the use of force will not be necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHL_andean_force_title;Force Chile into the Andes Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHL_andean_force_desc;Sadly, democracy had to be defended in Chile through less than peaceful means. Now that peace has come, and the calm restored, we can begin our process of joining Chile to the Andes Federation. By doing so, we can put the War of the Pacific behind us all for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
panama_compromise_title;Issues in the Panama Isthmus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
panama_compromise_desc;Although Panama is technically under the jurisdiction of the Colombians, there are many on the isthmus who would rather join the Federal Republic in Central America. To prevent conflict from erupting, the United States is in a position to peacefully resolve the issue and settle for good who rules Panama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRZ_USA_title;Imperial Questions in Brazil;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRZ_USA_desc;The United States has declared itself the protector of democracy in the New World, and while the foreign powers of Europe may have been completely banished, traces of their reign remain. In Brazil, the European ties of the ruling Braganza family are undeniable. What is the place of monarchies in this New World, and how should the United States act towards the Braganza families in Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LPL_USA_title;Form the United Provinces of La Plata;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LPL_USA_desc;In the United States continuing efforts to strengthen our control and ensure lasting peace South America, we can attempt to unite the people of the Rio de la Plata. The Argentinians have always been pushing for a more centralized state, and we are able to assist them. The United Provinces will live again and greater than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_rename_title;Rename Independence to New England;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEN_rename_desc;The renaming of New England was always a silly idea that was never popular with those living in the region. Now that sensibility has returned, its time for the proper name of New England to return to common usage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7597306;The foreign imperialists are gone, but what about the empires that remain? Are they saboteurs disguised as heads of states? Can democracy ever truly be guaranteed if a unelected man holds the highest office? Questions like these are abound in Washington as the issue what should be done about the Mexican Empire. Can a royal family exist in this New World of liberty the United States is attempting to build?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1726880;Recently our neighbors to the north have been on crusade against Imperialism, but now that all existential threats have been vanquished, the mad revolutionaries have been scouring the continent for problems. While the United States seems to have no issues with our monarchy, they have demanded that we institute some reforms which they believe will serve as safe guards for democracy. Needless to say, this is a huge infringement on Mexican sovereignty and to abide by these demands will ruffle the feathers of the traditionalist. However, to refuse will not only anger the liberals, but might even spur the Americans to invade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2786154;Recently our neighbors to the north have been on crusade against Imperialism, but now that all existential threats have been vanquished, the mad revolutionaries have been scouring the continent for problems. While the United States seems to have no issues with our monarchy, they have demanded that our Emperor abdicate in favor of a more Republican model. Needless to say, this is a huge infringement on Mexican sovereignty and to abide by these demands will ruffle the feathers of the traditionalist. However, to refuse will not only anger the liberals, but might even spur the Americans to invade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8981518;Our demands to the Mexican Empire have been met with a harsh rebuttal. US-Mexican relations are at a low, and the more aggressive Congressmen have been calling for war. Should we respect Mexican sovereignty or guarantee democracy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5578766;We have received reports that American troops have been arming the Mayan population in the Yucatan and now the entire peninsula is in a full blown rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8016634;The Caribbean is a diverse cluster of islands colonized by a wide array of nations and people, some who arrived more willing than others. Never the less, the United States is gifting upon those many islands an opportunity to be something greater. Although now that all the Antilles are under one flag, the question remains where shall the capital be. Should it be in the oldest city in the Caribbean, Havana, or a more central location like Jamaica. The Haitians share our revolutionary spirit, although perhaps to an extreme that not everyone is comfortable with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5853546;When American ships sailed into various ports in Alaska to announce to the local population their liberation into American hands, most were either unaware there was a war or apathetic towards the regime change. Although the most logical action would be to incorporate Alaska as a territory of the United States, some argue this would be imperialistic in nature and infringe upon the rights of population in Alaska. The majority Inuit population shows no interest in state building, and the small European Alaskan population is so small that it would not take long for American settlers to outnumber them. Although as barren as the land is, it would be a harmless yet prestigious display of good will to give it independence, under tight American supervision of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7391609;The recent invasion of the Mexican Empire by the United States has alarmed many here in Brazil. There are rumors in the royal court that it will be only a matter of time before the United States strikes south and attempts to oust Brazilian monarchy. None this is helped by the fact that liberals and other pro-republic factions have been inspired by the United States recent revolutionary fervor. It might be for the best if the Brazilian royal family were to slip away to safety in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9452276;The monarchy of Brazil has fled Rio, allowing pro-democracy forces to seize the capital and transform the country into a republic. It would seem are ideals of liberty our spreading throughout the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3886062;Brazil's transition into a republic has not been as stable as some have hoped. There are frequent clashes in the streets between conservatives and liberals which end in large amount of bloodshed by both sides. Something must be done, and those on the right are demanding the military step in to secure order and centralize the state. This might grant some stability, but it would be a betrayal to the ideas of democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2791898;In attempt to ensure stability, a military strongman in Brazil has taken emergency measures and in doing so severely restricted the democratic rights guaranteed by the previous government. Many in the United States view this recent regime change as something just as tyrannical if not more so than the monarchy that preceded the revolution. There are some the United States that are tired of frequently interfering in the affairs of other American countries. It might be for the best to simply recognize the new government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1595471;When the United States caught wind of the military seizing power, they almost immediately pressured the new government to step down and allow for elections. Although the United States is supposed to protect the New World not invade it, Brazil must be cautious in how it reacts to our Anglo neighbors to the north. It would be foolish to go head to head with the United States, but cowardly to simply bend to their wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2931608;The military government has refused to allow for free and open elections. If we want democracy to prevail in Brazil, we may have to invade. An unpopular idea, but a necessity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4949670;The Brazilian government has agreed to reforms and elections are on course to take place. Another victory for American diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1225875;The United States has demanded that we join the newly formed Andes Republic. The obvious choice is to refuse as Chile is a sovereign state. But then again, we might not want to anger the American eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7859305;Chile has refused to join the Andes Republic on the principle of sovereignty and what not. For the good of the New World and for the stability of South America, the obvious choice is to send a democratic expedition to Chile. Although there are many who would see this as gross violation of Chilean rights, everything the United States does is for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3552310;Although Panama is technically under the jurisdiction of the Colombians, there are many on the isthmus who would rather join the Federal Republic in Central America. The United States is in a position to peacefully resolve the issue to prevent conflict from erupting and settle for good who rules Panama. Panama can either join the FRCA, stay under the control of Gran Colombia, or perhaps dividing the isthmus between the two is a suitable compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC7680756;Due to war, civil unrest, and the overall lost of democratic morals and republican values, the United States of America is no longer the shining light of liberty that it once was. The collapse of American institutions and decline of American power means the United States is no longer able to manage its hegemonic grip over the New World. Uncertainty strikes the Americas and the future of the democratic states we have created remains unstable without American backing. Once again, the New World will be open to exploitation by foreign tyrants. Perhaps one day the United States will be able to recover its dignity, but that day is a long way off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2667604;Due to a wide array of factors, both external and internal, the United States is no longer the hegemony it once claimed to be. The New World is now in disarray as American support to North and South American states is being cut and relations severed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
