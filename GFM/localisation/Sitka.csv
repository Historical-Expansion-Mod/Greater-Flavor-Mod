EVT123599DESC;The problem has been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that empties directly into the Thames, but in this year, exacerbated by hot weather, the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that is present on the banks of the River Thames is becoming unbearable.

Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette has come up with plans to construct a new sewer system complete with pumping stations to end the Stink, though it would be quite expensive. Do we accept?;;;;;;;x;;;;

bon_compagni_law_title;Legge Bon-Compagni;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bon_compagni_law_desc;The Bon-Compagni Law, named after the Minister of Education Carlo Boncompagni of Mombello, establishes national boarding schools, which constitute the backbone of the new Piedmontese school system. The law provides for governmental control of schools of all levels, both state and free, through the Superior Council of Education, which is responsible for the organization of studies, teaching plans, the approval of course programs and books and treaties adopted. The law also eliminates the bishop's authorization for the appointment of professors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

legge_del_giugno_desc;The 22nd of June Law, introduced by the Minister of Education Giovanni Lanza reorganizes the administrative sector of public education, despite the contrary pressures of the Church which claim the monopoly of education, which confirms the secular and liberal direction of the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
casati_law_title;Legge Casati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
casati_law_desc;The Casati Law, which takes its name from the Minister of Education Gabrio Francesco Casati and follows the Bon Compagni laws of 1848 and Lanza of 1857, organically reforms the entire school system, from the administration to the articulation by orders and degrees and to teaching subjects, confirming the will of the State to take charge of the right and duty to intervene in school matters alongside and in place of the Catholic Church which for centuries was the only one to deal with education, introducing compulsory schooling in the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
