The miasma from the effluent is thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera before the Great Stink are blamed on the ongoing problems with the river. Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette has come up with plans to construct a new sewer system complete with pumping stations to end the Stink, though it would be quite expensive. Do we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bon_compagni_law_desc;The Bon-Compagni Law, named after the Minister of Education Carlo Boncompagni of Mombello, establishes national boarding schools, which constitute the backbone of the new Piedmontese school system. The law provides for governmental control of schools of all levels, both state and free, through the Superior Council of Education, which is responsible for the organization of studies, teaching plans, the approval of course programs and books and treaties adopted. The law also eliminates the bishop's authorization for the appointment of professors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC124618;The borders between French Guiana and Brazil are not clear. Past attempts at negotiations have failed, and in 1862 it was decided that the area between the Amazon and the Oyapock was a neutral territory. Paul Quartier who had previously visited the territory in 1883, returned in 1885 and had a meeting with the village chiefs of Counani and Carsewenne who are hostile to the Brazilians. The gentlemen signed a treaty on 23 July 1886 creating the buffer state of the Republic of Independent Guyana in the disputed area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
