DIM_flores_offer_title;The Portuguese East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flores_offer_desc;The Portuguese still hold sway over a small part of the East Indies: Timor and Flores. Many wars were fought over these territories, and Lisbon's presence there remains a thorn in our side. While these territories had previously been important outposts of Lisbon, by now very impoverished backwaters with little connection with to the motherland. We could approach the Portuguese to see if they are willing to sell their possessions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95252;Tensions in Malacca;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95252;Our mutual colonial ambitions in the East Indies are bringing us into increasing conflict with the Dutch. Tensions are particularly high surrounding the Straits of Malacca, a key channel for mercantile navigation in the East. Something must be done to resolve the growing conflict between our merchants.\n\nOur diplomats recommend defining clear "spheres of influence" in the region and exchanging territories: we would control trade and colonies in the Malay Peninsula to the north, while the Dutch would control Sumatra and the islands south of the Straits. Alternatively, if we don't mind throwing our weight around a bit, we could press the Dutch to unilaterally withdraw from the north side of the Strait, though it would damage our relations and they might refuse. What should our course be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95253;Malacca Exchange Proposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95253;Our mutual colonial ambitions in the East Indies are bringing us into increasing conflict with the British. Tensions are particularly high surrounding the Straits of Malacca, a key channel for mercantile navigation in the East. Something must be done to resolve the growing conflict between our merchants.\n\nNow the British propose to define clear "spheres of influence" in the region and exchange territories: they would control trade and colonies in the Malay Peninsula to the north, while we would control Sumatra and the islands south of the Straits. Should we accept their proposal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211202;The Sultanate of Palembang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211202;Relations with Palembang have always been troublesome, and things have not gotten better since the English left the region. During their brief tenure over the East Indies [1811-1814] they had the opportunity to install a new sultan, one which has proven less than friendly to our interest, but very much so to theirs. However, his rule was not ment to last: Through 'interventions' we've managed to install a sultan more favourable to our interests, but his authority outside of the city of Palembang is limited. Brigands and robbers roam the countryside, and the local Heads appear unable or unwilling to control them. Our commissionaire in the sultanate has expressed his desire to take a more direct role in ruling the state, and has asked us to enter into a new contract with the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211203;Unrest in Palembang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211203;The recent treaty with the sultanate of Palembang installed a sultan more amiable to our wishes, and was intended to provide a solid basis for stable relations. But alas our hopes were in vain: the sultan has proven too weak and extremely unreliable. Due taxes are no longer being paid, and it would seem he is behind the recent assassination of our commissionaire to the sultanate.\n\nBut all this is all rather irrelevant: Our post in Palembang is under siege by inlanders, and it would appear the sultan is behind this! To restore order, and maintain our authority, something has to be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211204;Dutch Military Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211204;In responds to our recent aggressive moves against them, the Dutch have decided to outfit a military expedition to 'restore [their] order' on our lands. We can hardly defend against the Dutch might, it is time to flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211205;Palembang Sultan flees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211205;Fearing our great military might, the Sultan of Palembang has decided to flee his realm, but was captured by one of our patrols and exiled to Bangka. His father has met our forces outside of the Kraton and has surrender himself to our forces. With both possible claimants to the throne under our sway, the Sultanate of Palembang de facto ceases to exist. We can abolish the sultanate and institute direct rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211300;The Future of the Portuguese East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211300;The Dutch have sent an embassy intend on settling some territorial issues in the East Indies. Throughout history we've fought many wars for control over Flores and Timor, and have now more or less settled on the Dutch controlling western Flores and Timor and us controlling eastern Flores and Timor. The Dutch have since greatly expanded their control over the archipelago, and are extracting vast wealth from the region. Our territories on the other hand are greatly impoverished, and our control over them is limited. Selling them would not be a great loss to us, were it not for the fact that we would lose all influence in the region. Perhaps we can find a different settlement beneficial to both countries?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211301;Portuguese reject our offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211301;After long negotiations, the Portuguese have decided to decline our generous offer. Although intrigued by the offer, the influence provided by their possessions outweigh our offer. Though not all is lost, our diplomatic correspondence indicate Lisbon is willing to better delineate our sphere's of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211302;Portuguese accept our offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211302;After long negotiations, the Portuguese have decided to propose a more limited sale: They are willing to part with their territories on Flores and Alor [Larantoeka], but insist on keeping Dili and eastern Timor. Our diplomats indicate there is nothing we can realisticly offer to change their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211303;Portuguese Counteroffer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211303;Intrigued by our interest in Timor and Flores, the Portuguese have made a counter proposal. They propose to transfer their possessions on Flores and the Alor archipelago [Larantoeka] in exchange for Koepang and our influence on Timor. This would, they argue, provide a clear division of power in the region. With us on Flores, and them on Timor, there would be no future conflict in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211304;Portuguese Counteroffer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211304;Intrigued by our interest in Timor and Flores, the Portuguese have made a counter proposal: They agree the East Indies are peripheral to their interests, and have indicated they are willing to sell their posts there. Their price is our forts along the Goldcoast. They argue these forts are as peripheral to our interests as Timor is to theirs, and it would make sense to swap these territories: a mutually beneficial exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211305;Dutch accept our counteroffer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211305;The Dutch were intrigued by our counteroffer, and have accepted after not so long deliberations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211306;Dutch reject our counteroffer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211306;The Dutch, while intrigued by our counteroffer, the Dutch have, after long deliberation, decided to decline our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211310;The Sandalwood trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211310;Sandalwood is a heavy, yellow, fine-grained hardwood, which -unlike other aromatic woods- maintains its fragrance for decades: A highly priced wood which had formed the basis of the $PROVINCENAME$ economy for centuries. Had, as this slow growing wood is now starting to run out, potentially ruining the local economy. The local climate and terrain is suitable for the cultivation of coffee, and it might offer a way out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211311;Backroom Politics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211311;Economic power waxes and wanes, and nowhere is this more true than the East Indies. Once the Portuguese reigned supreme in the region, but over the centuries we have surpassed them in every regard in the region. And now, with the depletion of Sandalwood -the pillar of the economy- on their islands, even their last outposts have fallen on hard times. So much so that the Portuguese governor of Dilli has approached us with an offer to sell the Portuguese possessions on Flores [Larantoeka] to us. It is clear that his offer is not sanctioned by Lisbon, but that does not have to matter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211312;The Sale of Flores;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211312;Our governor at Dilli has, on his own initiative, sold our possessions of Larantoeka on Flores and the Alor islands to the Dutch! Faced with limited means at his disposal to govern the islands, confounded by the decline in the sandalwood trade, his administration had fallen on hard times. Faced with severe financial problems, he apparently felt the Dutch were his best chance of salvation. The Dutch have by now taken possession of the islands, and the whole affair is a fait accompli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211313;Colonial Disobedience;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211313;Our governor at Dili has, on his own initiative, tried to sell our possessions on Flores and the Alor islands to the Dutch. Faced with limited means at his disposal to govern the islands, confounded by the decline in the sandalwood trade on the islands, his administration had fallen on hard times. Faced with severe financial problems, he apparently felt the Dutch were his best chance of salvation. The Dutch, apparently unwilling to jeopardize our relationship, have declared that they will only deal with our national government and declined the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
