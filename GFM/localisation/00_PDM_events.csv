EVTDESC2000_NEW;Foreign immigrants arriving in new countries often find themselves living together concentrated in relatively small areas, living in close proximity to, and seeking mutual support from, their national brethren, often forming little 'ethnic enclaves', such as New York's 'Little Italy'. One of our provinces is no exception, as the immigrant community there has formed a just such a thing, complete with all the cultural," linguistic and culinary flavors of the immigrants' homeland;Les immigrants étrangers en provenance de nouveaux pays avaient tendance a se concentrer dans des quartiers relativement restreints et a vivre a proximité les uns des autres pour se soutenir"," créant ainsi de petites """"enclaves ethniques"""" comme """"Little Italy"""" a New York. $PROVINCENAME$ n'y fait pas exception et cette communauté d'immigrants y a réinstauré les notes culturelles"," linguistiques et culinaire de sa terre natale."";Ausländische Einwanderer finden sich in ihren neuen Ländern häufig stark konzentriert in relativ kleinen Gebieten wieder", wo sie in enger Nachbarschaft zu ihren Landsleuten leben und sich mit diesen gegenseitige Unterstützung bieten.

EVTNAME4436;Immigration Quotas Questioned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4436;The plight of an immigrant family that has spent three years trying to get permission for relatives to join them in $COUNTRY$ has recently come to the attention of the government. The family meets all criteria for immigration except for one: the quotas have reached their limit, and officials have no recourse but to sometimes deny those who would otherwise be welcome. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ expatriates in other countries have held demonstrations against the policy, claiming it is based in racism and old-fashioned thinking. Conservatives say it is the only way to prevent immigrants from overrunning the system and causing chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16511;While debate has been raging in $CAPITAL$ regarding whether to negotiate with the Free States, loyal American troops within Free State territory have been on the move and preparing for the worst. One battalion relocated to Fort Mifflin and proceeded to ignore Free State demands for their immediate withdrawal.

This might lead to their refusal, but the alternative would be a setback to the years of friendly relations we have built up with the Maori peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC43806;The New Zealand government has approached us about the possibility of becoming part of the Australian Commonwealth. Their one stipulation is that equal rights be given to the Maori people-- out of concern, no doubt, for our historical treatment of the aborigines. Many Australians would be upset if we gave in to their demands, but agreeing would indeed make us a stronger nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC60010;Concerned by the growing chaos in $COUNTRY$, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leadership has stepped in to declare martial law and assume full control over the government.

EVTNAME97106;Control of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ India;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97106;One of the Indian Princely States has declared itself free of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

The Young Ottomans say that the Albanians have been loyal servants to the Empire and their millets deserve equal treatment to those of the Turks. This would also indicate a willingness to embrace European ideals. Reactionaries have rejected this notion, suggesting the Empire embrace the Bedouin population instead. This would indicate a commitment by the Empire towards traditional values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98622;A Question of Equality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98622;The Young Ottomans have begun campaigning for equality to be granted to Bosnian citizens-- a European culture which is also Muslim, and the embracing of which would further indicate an alignment towards Europe. Reactionaries have been quick to suggest that if equality is going to be granted to any distant group, it should be the Maghrebi. Doing so would indicate an alignment towards reclaiming the Empire's former expanse and away from Europe and its dangerous ideas. Appeasing both groups appears to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140101_sub;Saber Rattling in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140101;A decorated and high-ranking officer in $STATENAME$ has started to complain in public regarding his perceived lack of proper arms and supplies allocated to the military. He mingles his complaints with reminiscences of national glory and personal valor on far away battlefields. His voice carries great weight in both the military and general public. If we let him continue the state will undoubtedly become more jingoistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140201_sub;Barfight Turned Bloody;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140201;A group of young officers in the state of $STATENAME$ have started a barfight over a prostitute in a local tavern and proceeded to kill three lower class workers. A sham trial in a military court has found all the officers innocent and the lower classes are infuriated. If we put them up for re-trial in a civil court the lower classes will be appeased but the image of the military will be hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA140201;There is no need for a second trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140301;The Barracks from Hell;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME140301_sub;Wretched Conditions for our Soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140301;The deplorable conditions of a barracks in $STATENAME$ has become the subject of a widely read local newspaper. Maggot infested and rotten food along with faulty arms and ammunition has led to numerous injuries and outbreaks of disease. The barracks is supplied by a highly connected group of aristocrats and capitalists who are pressuring the government to ignore the matter, doing so will greatly upset the local soldiers. If we launch an official investigation the public will surely demand greater spending and oversight for military supply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA140301;We cannot allow this to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC140401;A major mine in $STATENAME$ has been running at a deficit for some time now and the owners are on the verge of bankruptcy. The laborers at the mine are unable to find alternative work and fear for their livelihoods. We could step in and subsidize or nationalize the mine but doing so will create greater expectations among the lower classes for intervention in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA140401;The government has no role to play here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140501_sub;Laissez-faire Sentiments;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140501;A highly respected university professor has written an increasingly influential theory supporting a laissez-faire economic policy. His theory has gained many supporters from the artisans of the state who feel threatened by government ties to factory owners. Through our contacts we have learned that this man is a secret homosexual. We could use this against him publically but doing so will anger the artisans and atheists of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140601_sub;Workers in Woe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140601;Many of the factory workers in $STATENAME$ live a tragic life. Miserable and dejected," these poor souls are unable to fulfill even the most basic life needs. Among their flimsy shanties and squalid alleys a champion has risen among them. He preaches a new system to the hopeless masses in which every willing man and woman has a job and is provided for. A system in which the rich do not prey upon the weak. Factory workers across the state are heeding his words and the capitalists are fearful of the consequences. We could arrange an ""accident"" during his shift but that will cause great unrest among the workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA140601;His next shift will be his last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140701;Evil at the Altar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME140701_sub;There's Something Rotten in the Choir;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140701;A dark and terrible secret has been brooding among the clergy in $STATENAME$. Whispers in dark corners speak of a deranged priest molesting young children. This pedophile has gone unchecked for quite some time while the rest of the clergy maintained disbelief. Now he is being shuffled about, moved from one parish to another, in order to cover up the story and secure the church's reputation. Rumors of his existence are spreading throughout the populace and the church is begging us to let them handle the matter. They claim that a public hearing would cause their flock to lose faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA140701;If the church will not provide justice, the state gallows will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB140701;This is a great evil, but the faithful must not fall into unholy disbelief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140801_sub;Corpses Recourses;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140801;One of the larger places of worship for our predominant faith in $STATENAME$ has started construction on an expansion. The construction workers have discovered a previously unknown graveyard on the expansion's land that houses the dead of a religious minority. The minority's leaders have insisted that the government halt the expansion. Doing so will appease the minority, but the clergy and moralists will be upset that a chance to put our faith forcefully above all others was missed, especially since the ground has already been consecrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA140801;Corpses make excellent foundations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME140901_sub;Engravings Causing Ravings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC140901;In order to emphasize the multi-religious makeup of $STATENAME$ and the law's relationship with the divine, a courthouse in $STATENAME$ has taken upon itself to install a series of reliefs along its walls detailing great lawbringers from various faiths. The placement of such large and overtly religious carvings has caused a fiery debate to break out between those advocating a separation of religion and state and those who applaud the addition of pluralistic religious ideals to the courthouse. With whom shall we side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME141001_sub;Minorities Under Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC141001;A teenage girl was found beaten and raped in a cultural minority's section of a city in $STATENAME$. Since the authorities have no leads, members of our primary culture have taken it upon themselves to seek retribution on the minority and anti-minority sentiments are becoming widespread. The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation. Bringing the retribution-seeking attackers to justice probably will not abate the anti-minority sentiments. However, we could falsify an investigation into the rape and claim it was in fact not committed by a minority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME141101_sub;My Four Walls and Nobody Else's;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC141101;Minorities in $STATENAME$ are starting to gather and protest over the right to own property. Dishonest landowners in the state have repeatedly abused the minorities by collecting rent and then evicting them on false charges. The minorities have little legal recourse as their rights are almost non-existent. Recently, a family of immigrants who were wrongfully evicted from their residence died from exposure during an extremely cold night. Newspapers have picked up the story and are inflaming public opinion against our residency laws. We could let the anti-residency sentiments grow," or we could pay off some newspapers to run an opposing story detailing the ""uncouth and devious"" nature of the minority's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA141101;These people are humans and they deserve rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME141201_sub;The Minority Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC141201;Minorities in $STATENAME$ have gradually lifted themselves out of poverty and into the middle class. They have started their own sports organizations, newspapers, and religious centers. A particularly racist and sharply divided town in $STATENAME$ has voted in a series of laws that effectively bans a large minority's most important cultural festival. The laws probably would not have garnered enough votes if cultural minorities were allowed to vote. The debate about spreading full citizenship to minorities is raging among the state's newspapers and those in favor of full citizenship seem to be gaining the most sympathy. To stop this movement we could stage an arson attack on the racist town's city hall and make it look like the minority was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA141201;Framing an arson attack on minorities? Brilliant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB141201;Let the debate take its course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC141301;Artisans in $STATENAME$ fear for their livelihoods. In every stall in every market there seems to be more and more goods stocked from abroad. The artisans have started a public campaign to sway the rest of the population towards protectionism. Their rallying cry is simple and blunt: 'our nation, our markets, and our goods'. We could launch a public relations campaign detailing the importance of free trade to our export industry but such a move will disgruntle our artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA141301;Launch the counter-campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME141401_sub;Factories Push for Free Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC141401;An association of capitalists in $STATENAME$ have begun a public relations campaign educating their workers on the value of free trade. They have quite successfully persuaded the clerks and craftsmen of the state that free trade is in their and the factories' best interest. The free trade campaign has begun to make an impact on the population as a whole. We could launch a counter campaign emphasizing the necessity of protectionism to many facets of our economy but that would greatly upset the capitalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC142601;A debate being held in $STATENAME$ prompted a riot when arguments being made about slavery prompted anger by abolitionists in the crowd.

EVTNAME800099;Nationalist Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800099;Nationalist rebels have successfully seceded from $COUNTRY$. Their young nation, however, is still very much in chaos and vulnerable to attack.

EVTNAME800116;Underground Newspaper;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800116;Those opposed to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have started printing an underground newspaper in one of our provinces, spreading revolutionary ideas with headlines like 'The Monarchy Must End!'.

EVTNAME8001160;Newspaper Articles Criticize Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001160;It seems our policy of allowing the newspapers to speak as they wish is now coming to haunt us. Recently, a prominent newspaper in one of our provinces has published a high-profile article criticising the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy. If we do nothing, this talk will spread. Yet our only other option is to restrict the freedom of the press entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800117;Demonstration in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
