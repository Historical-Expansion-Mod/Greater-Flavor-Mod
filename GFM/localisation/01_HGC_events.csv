EVTNAME600050;Polish Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600050;When a Polish insurrection broke out in Galicia (Austrian Poland) and Krakow early in 1846 many Austrians held that Krakow's independent status provided the stimulus as well as a forum for the planning of Polish revolts. However, we are still bound by the Treaty of Vienna and our administration of Krakow with Prussia and Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600051;The Krakow Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600051;Polish nobles and scholars in our great city are starting a great revolution to restore Poland and end serfdom in our lands. This democratic movement is gathering momentum and might erupt at any time through Polish occupied lands. We can support it, incurring the anger of our neighbors and possibly invasion, or we can suppress it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT600051OPTA;Let the revolutionaries take the city. Unite Poland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT600051OPTB;Suppress the revolutionaries or the Austrians might retaliate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600052;The Polish Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600052;A revolution has begun in Krakow and it threatens to spread like wildfire in our great nation. Austria is asking our consent to suppress Krakow, arguing the free city is the focus of the Polish nationality and insurgency and that suppressing the city can end future Polish rebellions. Our diplomats are worried that this rebellion may grow if we don't support the Austrians. What do we tell the Austrian envoy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT600052OPTA;Let the Austrians know that they have our support on this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600057;Colorado Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600057;Colorado Rebels took the government and forced president Oribe to step down. Fructuoso Rivera, once exiled in Brazil, returned and now assumes the country as interim president until the next election. Manuel Oribe, the former Blanco President, was forced to flee the country in exile to Buenos Aires. Rivera dissolved the parliament, called for an election and installed pro-Colorado politicians in the upper house while the Colorado Caudillos are laying down their arms and donating what they can to help the Colorado government. France and the United Kingdom, seeking the downfall of Rosas, are also sending help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600057A;Long Live Fructuoso Rivera!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600058;Oribe's Exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600058;President Manuel Oribe from Uruguay was deposed by the Colorado Party and fled the country to Buenos Aires. Governor of Buenos Aires and president of the Argentine Confederation, Juan Manuel de Rosas, received him as the constitutional president and soon offered him the command of the armies of the Argentine Confederation. Rivera, the interim president of Uruguay and leader of the Colorados, is extremely hostile to Rosas and to the Confederation thanks to the fact that Rosas and other Federalist Argentines backed Oribe in the past as well due to ideological differences. Rivera now harbour Argentine exiles that might cause problems in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600058A;Argentina will never recognize Rivera as President.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600058B;It's better to not risk a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600059;The Rise of the Colorados;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600059;The political scene in Uruguay during the 1830s became split between two parties, the conservative Blancos ("Whites") and the liberal Colorados (literally "coloureds", more usually "Reds"). The Colorados were led by Fructuoso Rivera and represented the business interests of Montevideo. The Blancos were headed by Manuel Oribe, who looked after the agricultural interests of the countryside and promoted protectionism. The two groups took their names from the color of the armbands that they wore. Initially, the Colorados wore blue, but when it faded in the sun, they replaced it with red. \n \n The Uruguayan Constitution of 1830 didn't anticipate the sharing of political power between parties, which forced the minorities to resort to revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600059A;Troublemakers, the lot of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600060;Oribe's Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600060;With the destruction of our army, Oribe took the opportunity to seize the countryside. Now, they are moving in to take the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600060A;That can't end well for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6000061;The Argentine Unitarianists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6000061;For a long time, two projects of country divided Argentina. Unitarianists or Unitarians were the proponents of the concept of a Unitary state (centralized government) in Buenos Aires and they were led by  Juan Lavalle. They were opposed to the Argentine Federalists, who wanted a federation of independent provinces, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Unitarians, sympathetic to our government, fled Argentina in exile after being defeated in 1831. Rosas, the so called Restorer of the Laws, controlled the Argentina Confederation for too long under his despotic rule. They harbour Oribe, who claims is still president, and their government is hostile to ours. Our most trusted Caudillos argue that it is time to prepare for war and for that end we can weaken the Confederation by using our Unitarianist friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT6000061A;Contact Genaro Berón de Astrada, Governor of Corrientes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600063;The Big War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600063;Genaro Berón de Astrada, governor of Corrientes, pledged to support us in our struggle against Rosas. The moment has arrived to rid the world of the tyrant. If we back down now, our government might look weak. France and the United Kingdom, that long had an attrition with Rosas, will surely help us in our struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPT600063B;This is a dangerous move. Let the Blancos and Rosas in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600064;Rivera backs down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600064;The Uruguayan President backed down from the war with Rosas, but Rosas knows of the plan. This, combined with previous attrition with him, will surely lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600064A;Fight to the last man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600064B;It's time to step down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600065;The Uruguayan Aggression;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600065;Rivera, the Uruguayan president, convinced governor Genaro Berón de Astrada to support him and Corrientes in a rebellion against Buenos Aires. Uruguay is preparing for war against us and they seek to depose Rosas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600065A;The fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600066;The Italian Legion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600066;Giuseppe Garibaldi moved in with his wife and has been living in Montevideo for a time already. A sworn fighter against tyranny, he now has offered his help in setting up the defences of Montevideo against Oribe and Rosas and has offered to lead an Italian Legion made of foreign soldiers that will help us in the struggle against the tyranny of Rosas. Furthermore, it has been recommended that we do as the Blancos are planning to do and abolish slavery in Uruguay so we can have more soldiers for the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600066A;We welcome him and his soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600066B;We don't need any help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600067;The Defences of Montevideo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600067;The Italian Legion of Garibaldi has finished the construction of a fort and barricades throughout the city. This will, without a doubt, help us in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600067A;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600068;Garibaldi seizes a province;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600068;The Italian Legion has defeated the enemy in a province and seized it back, returning it for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME600069;The Fall of the Blancos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600069;After years of struggle, the Blancos are losing their strength. Our country, once torn by civil war, is beginning to unite and the flames of revolutions are dying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600069A;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600070;Brazilian Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600070;The war with Argentina and the Blancos costed too much already and our people want peace, internally and externally. The Brazilians are showing some interest in the conflict, and our country, and they would help us much in the struggle against Rosas and Oribe. Our diplomats began the talks and the conditions the Brazilians are asking are the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of our claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil's right to interfere with our internal affairs. \n \n Getting Brazilian help would undoubtedly tip the war in our favour and it is better than to risk another Blanco government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600070A;I'm sure there will be no problems. Ask for their help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600070B;We can take care of this war by ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600071;Uruguay asks for our help;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600071;For a long time, Uruguay has been plunged into turmoil. It fights the Blancos, which aren't too fond of us, and the Argentine, which aren't too fond of us either. But the war isn't going very well for them, and they are asking for our help. In exchange for our help, they  are proposing several benefits for our country, such as treaties for the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of their claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil's right to interfere with Uruguay internal affairs. This would undoubtedly bring our countries close together and can serve as a the start of Brazilian hegemony in the south of the continent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600071A;Agree to these terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600071B;We can't afford to help them right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600072;Spheres of Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600072;After years of struggle for power, both the Colorados and the Blancos were weary of the chaos. In $YEAR$, they came to an agreement to define spheres of influence: the Colorados would control Montevideo and the coastal region, the Blancos would rule the hinterland with its agricultural estates. In addition, the Blancos were paid a lump sum of money to compensate them for the loss of their stake in Montevideo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600072A;Finally we can have some peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600072B;Unnecessary. Our current government will always have power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600073;Spheres of Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600073;Blancos and Colorados finally learned to share political power. This will severely reduce rebellion and aggressions between the parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT600073A;Uruguay can rest;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME700000;Death of Francia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700000;Paraguayan supreme dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, took several precautions against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure there was no poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide. All shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed. Sensing his mortality, he destroyed all his papers and refused medical aid, even lashing out at a physician with his sabre. In this day, Francia breathed his last and passed away. Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years' pay. His daughter later burnt all his furniture after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT700000A;The end of an era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME700001;The Rise of Carlos Lopéz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700001;Carlos Antonio López Ynsfrán, nephew of Francia, attracted the hostility of the dictator and uncle and he was forced to keep in hiding for several years. He was briefly secretary of the military junta that ruled the country after Francia's death and today, after years of confusion and chaos since Francia's death, he was chosen as the country's first consul--a post equivalent to that of president -- ruling alongside Mariano Roque Alonso.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME700003;Foreign Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700003;López lead an extremely aggressive foreign policy which frequently caused attrition with other governments. In 1853, he refused to ratify a commercial and navigational treaty with the United States and began confiscating the property of American citizens residing in Paraguay. Because of a dispute with Britain, López closed Paraguayan waters to foreign warships. Today, Paraguayan soldiers fired upon an American ship engaged in a scientific survey of the Parana River, killing one American crew member.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME700004;The Paraguay Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700004;Some years ago, the American ship USS Water Witch was doing a scientific expedition on the Paraná River when Paraguayan troops fired against it. This act of aggression wasn't met by an official apology by Paraguayan dictator Carlos López. This insult went unanswered for too long. Now, the US Congress authorized for a Naval Squadron to be sent to Paraguay to seek redress from Paraguay for the shelling of the Water Witch, which had resulted in the death of the an American citizen, the ship's helmsman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC700005;Tensions between the United States of America and Paraguay reached a critical point this year as the USA plans to seek an apology for the shelling of one of its ships on the Parana river.

Although he strived for equality of the people, Francia ruthlessly destroyed any opposition and created a Police state, imprisoning all those he deemed seditious. \n Francia lived a spartan lifestyle, and apart from some books and furniture, his only possessions were a tobacco case and a pewter confectionery box.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Statute was pronounced in occupied Warsaw on March 1832 by Marshal Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich, who named himself a namestnik. The Statute, signed by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, replaced the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Empire with the "eternal incorporation" of Poland into Russia.

EVTDESC50000;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of "now or never". Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d'etat and tried to institute a republic on $YEAR$. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome.

vargastitle;The Rise of Getulio Vargas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vargasdesc;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50009;The course of Venezuelan history changed markedly at the turn of the 20th century. In 1899 General Cipriano Castro, a caudillo from the Andean state of Táchira, descended on Caracas with his provincial army and seized the presidency. As a result, five successive military strongmen from Táchira, known as Andinos, controlled the nation for the next 59 years, except for an interlude in 194548. The longest rule being the one of General Juan Vicente Gómez. Gómez was an effective, if ruthless, dictator. By manipulating elections, abolishing all organized political activity, and monopolizing appointive powers, he established a completely subservient legislative and judicial structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
