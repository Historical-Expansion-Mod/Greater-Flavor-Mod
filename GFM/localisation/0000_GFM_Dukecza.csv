lanzas_desc;Two years ago, the caudillo Timoteo Aparicio, leader of the Partido Nacional, commonly known as the "Blancos," jump-started a revolution known as "Revolúcion de las Lanzas" (Revolution of the Lances). Timoteo's desires with said revolution were to increase the representation of minority parties within the Uruguayan government. Timoteo has been successful, forcing us to ratify a power-sharing treaty, giving the Partido Nacional political control over the departments of Cerro Largo, Florida, Canelones, and San José.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA46400;Those damn Blancos!;;;;;;;;;
itatiaia_desc;For the first time, the "Pico das Agulhas Negras" (Black needles peak) localised in the Itatiaia massif, part of the Mantiqueira mountains, has been hiked by Carlos Spierling and Osvaldo Leal. Franklin Massena and André Rebouças attempted to climb the Itatiaia in 1878 and 1898, respectively.;;;;;;;;;

BRZ_42_lib_desc;Liberal supporters in the provinces of Minas Gerais and São Paulo are furious with the current government and its pro-conservative agenda. Several disgruntled liberals have now taken up arms and removed conservative governors, replacing them with liberal allies. We must not let them get to Rio!;;;;;;;;;

cemiterada_desc;Today is a grim day for São Salvador, as four thousand citizens led by religious leaders are protesting against the private cemetery of "Campo Santo," the reasoning behind such senseless violence is that, before the government of Bahia passed these cemetery laws. Religious leaders were responsible for the funerary process in Bahia and, therefore, benefited from a sizable amount of money paid by those who desired a burial in churches, capital that would now be in the hands of somebody else.;;;;;;;;;
brz_metric_desc;The government of Brazil has passed a law that swaps the Imperial system for the new Metric system. Intellectuals in Brazil have asserted to us that this change will be beneficial. However, this might upset some merchants as they believe the Metric system will cause a decline in profit.;;;;;;;;;
brz_kilo_desc;Some of our subjects in the northeast are discontent with our change to Metric, even resorting to violence. In the village of Fagundes, Paraiba, the water tanks, now measured in Metric, were attacked by these peasants as the first sparkle of revolt. More than 60 different areas in the Nordeste have reported attacks from these so-called "Kilogram breakers".;;;;;;;;;
praieira_desc;Disgruntled Liberals in the Northeast have organised a Revolt against the government of Brazil, claiming they are underrepresented in the government. The rebels demand a Free press, currently censored to protect the integrity of Brazil's Monarchy, and some of these rebels demand a Republic. We must not let this happen.;;;;;;;;;
praieira_lib_desc;We're victorious! After arduous fighting, we have finally captured the capital city of Rio de Janeiro. Now it's time for the government of Brazil to accept our demands! Viva o Partido Liberal! Viva o Povo Brasileiro!;;;;;;;;;
seca_desc;The Great Drought has hit us, leaving thousands dead in the Northeast's Sertão, with thousands more immigrating out of the area to both the amazon and south. The people in the area were unprepared for such drought, caused by the poor management of the region and its irregular agriculture, worsened by how poor and neglected the Northeast is relative to the rest of the country.;;;;;;;;;
muckers_desc;The Muckers were a group of German immigrants that followed a "miraculous healer" known as Jacobina Mentz Maurer, who has now led an angry death mob that has caused the death of hundreds, alongside many cases of arson. Fortunately, the army has done its duty and has put down these insane religious extremists, Jacobina included. We shall never have to deal with this again.;;;;;;;;;
BRZ_democracy;United States of Brazil;;;;;;;;;
queiros_desc;The government of Brazil has signed the law known as "Eusébio de Queirós," named after an Angola-born abolitionist senator, as an attempt to halt the rampant illegal slave trade. Because of this law, many slave owners have begun mass-importing slaves.;;;;;;;;;
comarca_desc;The Comarca do Rio São Francisco used to belong to the province of Pernambuco. However, its government seceded from the Empire of Brazil in 1824 as the Confederação do Equador, causing Emperor Pedro I to punish Pernambuco by stripping them of said Comarca and transferring its ownership to the province of Minas Geraes. But after three years of Mineiro rule, the area has been temporarily given to Bahia. It is time to decide whether or not to maintain the Bahiano control over the region or hand it back to Minas Gerais or Pernambuco.;;;;;;;;;
angola_purchase_title;The Angola Purchase;;;;;;;;;
angola_purchase_desc;Angola is a long-established Portuguese colony in eastern Africa on the other side of the Atlantic. Our rising position on the global stage makes it tempting to expand our borders beyond South America. Perhaps we can negotiate to buy Angola, giving us an advantage over Portugal, our former colonial master.;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME47074;Brazil Offers to Purchase Angola;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47074;With Brazil's rising status in the world, they have sought to expand its borders beyond South America. They have offered to purchase Angola from us for 100,000 dollars. Losing Angola will cripple our efforts to conquer more of Africa, but should Angola be considered a nuisance, 100,00 dollars doesn't sound bad.;;;;;;;;;
EVT47074PTA;That price is tempting.;;;;;;;;;
EVT47074PTB;Angola is ours. Its status is non-negotiable.;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME47075;Portugal Accepts the Angola Purchase;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47075;Angola is now Brazilian, allowing us to conquer more of the continent if we so desire. The possibilities for expansion are endless!;;;;;;;;;
EVT47075PTA;The world will know Brazil's might!;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME47076;Portugal Rejects the Angola Purchase;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47076;Portugal insists Angola is rightfully theirs, no matter what price we name, meaning we cannot annex the lands of Angola peacefully anymore. However, if Portugal doesn't want to hand over Angola, we can always take it by force.;;;;;;;;;
EVT47076PTA;We take it back. Portugal won't get a say in Angola's fate.;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME47077;Nina Rodrigues;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47077;Nina Rodrigues (1862-1906) was a Brazilian legist, psychiatrist, professor, writer, anthropologist and ethnologist. Notable eugenicist, he is considered the founder of Brazilian criminal anthropology. Nino is credited with pioneering studies on black culture and people, even though he adopted a racist point of view.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA47077;Interesting indeed;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47078;Rio de Janeiro, our nation's capital, suffers from a chronic lack of urban planning. Besides being inefficient, it also contributes to diseases like smallpox, bubonic plague, and yellow fever spreading like wildfire in the city. A series of urban reforms is needed to modernize the city and eradicate endemic diseases.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA47078;I'm sure this won't backfire.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47079;The population of Rio de Janeiro is rioting. The mayor has used the great powers we gave him to destroy slums, displacing people out of their houses whilst modernizing the City. The mayor has also begun enforcing mandatory vaccination by invading homes with citizens that hadn't yet accepted vaccines. These measures brought the population to protest against forced vaccination, and the protests sparked a riot.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA47079;It did backfire...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47080;Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, or Machado de Assis, is considered by many to be the biggest name in Brazilian literature. Born in an impoverished family descendant of emancipated slaves, having hardly ever studied and never gone to university, he wrote ten romances and 205 tales and introduced realism to Brazil. Joaquim was one of the first writers to write about the social problems in Brazil and influenced other authors for years to come.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47081;Antonio Frederico de Castro Alves, or Castro Alves, was a famous Brazilian poet known as "the slave's poet". He is considered the greatest romantic poet of Brazil. His poetry showed the horrific reality of slavery and made the abolitionist movement stronger.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA47081;A great man indeed.;;;;;;;;;
araucania_ptg_desc;Since the arrival of the French lawyer Orelie-Antoine the region known as "Araucania" has been in turmoil as more and more Amerindian chiefs side with Antoine. This madman continues to spit poisonous words of Independence for the Mapuche tribes under his self-proclaimed Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia. We, of course, know this is nothing more than a case of somebody that might need to "take the train" and stop annoying us with such delusions. But the French and (especially) the Mapuche might not be too happy with such an outcome.;;;;;;;;;
ptg_revolt_early_desc;Ignoring the situation might not have been the smartest of decisions by the Chilean government. This loathsome delusional maniac has gathered enough supporters for an outright revolt, declaring himself Roi d'Araucanie et de Patagonie. We will not tolerate this. We must quelch these rebellious scum as fast as possible! Santiago won't fall!;;;;;;;;;

antoine_begs_FRA_desc;Chile has deported the self-proclaimed King Orélie-Antoine de Tounens after declaring the Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia, returning him to his home nation of France. Antoine has begged the Emperor of France for help freeing his beloved Araucanie nation. Should we accept this humble request for Freedom in the name of an oppressed people? Or shall we put this madman where he belongs? That being an insane asylum.;;;;;;;;;

sao_francisco_transfer_title;The Transposing of the São Francisco River;;;;;;;;;
sao_francisco_transfer_desc;The São Francisco river, born in the province of Minas Gerais, travels north into the semi-arid Northeast of the country. Some have proposed we transpose the waters of this river to help citizens living in the dry Caatinga and other areas alike, as it could very well save the population of the Northeast in the future.;;;;;;;;;

GUK_desc;Recently a wave of Ukrainians from Odessa settled in the region once known as Greater Manchuria. Ukrainian immigration towards the Primorskaya Oblast has been ongoing since 1882, as free transport and land got promised to the Ukrainian citizens. However, it wasn't until the construction of railroads in the region that the number of settlers increased to 14 thousand a year. The Ukrainian share of Primorskaya's population was 15%~ in 1897.;;;;;;;;;

pedro_americo;The artwork "Independência ou Morte" by Brazilian artist Pedro Américo represents the most well-known moment of Brazil's independence as the then Prince Pedro de Alcântara loudly exclaims: "Independence or Death!" near the shores of Ypiranga. Pedro's painting got first revealed in Firenza, Italy. It received many positive reviews, such as the publication in the newspaper Corriere Italiano: "Américo's new painting is a colossal piece of art, the exact locations flora and topography were studied and masterfully represented with all of its historical glamour." Later on, during the inauguration of the Museu Paulista, Américo brought it to Brazil, where it received Innumerous positive reviews and exploded in popularity. And to this day, it is the most recognizable piece of media surrounding Brazil's War of Independence.;;;;;;;;;
sp_rgs_railway_title;The São Paulo - Rio Grande Railway;;;;;;;;;
sp_rgs_railway_desc;Engineer João Teixeira Soares has made projects for a railroad linking the Province of São Paulo to the Province of Rio Grande do Sul. The railroad would be 1.403km long and run via the interior of São Paulo towards Rio Grande do Sul alongside the provinces of Santa Catharina and Paraná. The railroad, if constructed, would connect the city of Rio de Janeiro with Argentina and Uruguay, allowing for better communication and transportation of goods from Rio to the rest of the Platine Basin.;;;;;;;;;
contestado_desc;Peasants from the contested region between the Federative units of Paraná and Santa Catharina have begun an armed conflict with Percival Farquhar's workers in the São Paulo - Rio Grande Railroad, peasants who believe their lands are being "stolen" by Percival. Alongside these "jagunços," the Monk José Maria has declared an independent "Celestial Monarchy" after proclaiming our righteous Republic "The Devil's law" and crowned an alphabet as the Emperor of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;

lei_de_terras_desc;A reorganization of private land ownership has been proposed to our government, something that, until this moment, has not been regulated by any specific legal document. In the Senate, a majority comprised mostly of ruralists wants to make government-owned land only available by purchase. A minority of senators wants to create colonization programs to give away land to settlers and increase our control of the interior. Which side will prevail in this discussion?;;;;;;;;;
1834_additional_act_title;The 1834 Additional Act;;;;;;;;;
1834_additional_act_desc;Law n° 16, also known as the "Additional act," reformed the Imperial Constitution of 1824. After Pedro's abdication, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies rapidly filed itself with "Liberais" three years after the then Emperor's abdication: Increase the autonomy of provinces and abolish the "Regencia Trina" in favour of a more unitary Regencia Unica.;;;;;;;;;

andrew_jackson_attack_desc;Today, President Andrew Jackson exited via the East Portico of the American Capitol after witnessing the Funeral of Warren D. Davis (A representative of the State of South Carolina.) Richard Lawrence ambushed Andrew by aiming a firearm at Jackson and proceeded to fire - most likely to the humid weather, the pistol misfired and did not kill Jackson. Lawrence drew a second pistol out of his jacket and attempted to assassinate the President for the second time, which too failed. Infuriated, President Andrew Jackson repeatedly hit the to-be-murderer with a cane, to where the people at the event had to hold Jackson fearing he would beat Richard to a pulp. The exact reasoning behind Richard's attempt is unknown. Jackson did not seem to be sane, without providing any logical reason behind his actions during interrogations: Lawrence is in the Government Hospital for the Insane.;;;;;;;;;
garrafada_desc;Pedro was on a journey to the province of Minas Gerais to quench local federalist support before being forced to retreat to the Imperial capital. He found immense resistance from the nativist population caused by rumours implying he'd close the Congress and declare an absolutist Coup d'etat. Several Pedro-allied Portuguese merchants in Rio got together to plan a welcome-back party that backfired as the Liberal Brazilians perceived it as an "insult to the nation and all she stood for." All this indignation fuming out of the Nativist populous exploded into physical violence in the so-called "Night of Bottles.";;;;;;;;;
pedro_i_abdication_desc;Many Brazilians question the authoritarian tendencies of Dom Pedro I and his "Poder Moderador." Newspapers such as "Aurora Fluminense" in Rio protested against the Emperor and his peculiar political decisions. The tension escalated between the Liberals and Pro-Pedro politicians when forces allied to the Emperor murdered Badaró (an Italian journalist) in an ambush causing great distress amongst the Liberal population. Dom Pedro attempted to quench the Liberal equivocacies like the ones in Minas Gerais caused by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos. Pedro failed to reduce the Liberal tensions in Minas and other provinces. Today: Pedro dissolved the old ministry and installed one allied to him with two Portuguese Ministers, decisions that triggered a protest in the Campo de Aclamação demanding the return of previous Ministers. Pedro's luck strikes once again as the Imperial troops join the protests leaving the then-Emperor without any support from the Imperial Army. Pedro's only choice was to abdicate.;;;;;;;;;
pnb_cabanada_desc;The Cabanada was a Conservative revolt in the regions of Agreste and Zona da Mata Nordestina that desired the return of Emperor Pedro I to the Brazilian throne, being against the Regencia Trina and Infante Dom Pedro II. The political and social fragility caused by the Emperor's abdication culminated in a Revolution headed by local landlords allied to the "Coluna do Trono do Altar" society in Portugal that sought the return of the now resigned Portuguese Emperor. Landlords have also cut relations with the Engenhos giving the revolt an anti-slavery flavour.;;;;;;;;;
rusga_desc;Since Brazil's independence, the nation's politics has had two political sects, a Liberal sect that sought higher autonomy for the various Provinces and the leftover Portuguese that defended a more centralised government alongside keeping their privileges. After Pedro's abdication, the country plummeted into turmoil as tensions between these two sects exponentially increased, leading to acts of violence against each other, such as the event known as "Rusga" in Mato Grosso. Fueled by Liberal societies such as "Sociedade dos Zelosos da Independência" and the "Sociedade Filantrópica," the Liberal mob attacked any Portuguese citizen they came across, raiding their homes.;;;;;;;;;
fumaca_desc;The Revolta do Ano da Fumaça (Year of Fog) acquired this name due to a thick fog that settled in the province of Minas Gerais during the revolt. A group of Caramurus (Portuguese reactionaries) marched onto the capital (Ouro Preto,) utilising the fact that the Province president wasn't present. The Caraumurus were in their majority: Portuguese merchants who'd complain about "despotic" actions by the current government. Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos organised a legitimate government in the city of São João D'el Rey as a response and sent 6.000 men toward Ouro Preto to quench the Restauradores.;;;;;;;;;
great_bsn_uprising_desc;After the Russo-Ottoman war, the Ottoman Empire gave Serbia suzerainty angering the nearby Bosnian populous and landlords. Furthermore, the recent reforms by Mahmud II entailing the expansion of the centralised Nizam, taxes and Ottoman bureaucracy, which weakened the power of Bosniak governors, have all culminated in an uprising led by Gradacevic: being declared Vizier of Bosnia in front of the Emperor's mosque.;;;;;;;;;
pedro_i;Emperor Dom Pedro I;;;;;;;;;
pedro_i_desc;Pedro I finds himself at odds with the Brazilian people. Many believe he cares more about Portugal than Brazil due to his involvement in the current Portuguese Civil War. His many controversies have caused relentless unrest in the lands of Brazil. Perhaps his only option is to abdicate and sail through the shores of Rio and never return.;;;;;;;;;

no_more_janissaries_desc;With the recent elimination of the janissary forces, our army is in disarray. We have almost no professional forces and few remaining commanders. While our armed forces will recover in time, for now they are significantly weakened.;;;;;;;;;
build_brasilia_desc;Since the governance of Marquês do Pombal in Portugal, there have been talks about a new Brazilian capital. The Father of Brazilian Independence: José Bonifacio was the first to refer to this city as "Brasilia." Such a name comes from the formal demonym for those born in Brazil: "Brasiliense." The Portuguese term "Brasileiro" only defined those who traded or trafficked Brazil-Wood in the 1500s.;;;;;;;;;
brasilia_name_desc;Now that we have finished building the new capital in the interior, we need to choose a proper name for such a magnificent city. Some suggest we should name it after a well-known figure in our history. While others mention the nation itself as an option, the name "Brasilia" is already in the popular consciousness being a reference to the people themselves.;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_1851_URU_title;The Brazil-Uruguay Border treaty of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_1851_URU_desc;Since the "Convênio Preliminar de Paz" in 1838, when the United Kingdom forcefully dismembered the province of Cisplatina from the Brazilian nation, there hasn't been a consensus on where the Brazil-Uruguay border should start and end. Some claim the region between the Quaraí and Arapeí rivers as Brazilian and part of the Riograndense province, harkening back to the convention of 1819. Others in Uruguay reclaim the old border of the Banda Oriental, pushing Uruguay's boundary to the Ibicuí river. And there are those within the infant oriental republic who claim the entirety of the old Misiones territory. And, of course, who could forget the region of "Campos Neutrais," East of the Mirim Lake. As a showcase of Friendship, we shall send a proposal to the Oriental Republic of Uruguay to sort out our differences and settle the inconclusive boundary between the two countries.;;;;;;;;;
uru_brz_treaty_desc;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed a border treaty to end all the senseless bickering between $FROMCOUNTRY$'s and Uruguay's people. Ratifying this treaty would greatly benefit our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$. But, doing so means giving up on our so-called "ludicrous" claims on the lands of Misiones and recognise the old "Campos Neutrais" as $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, therefore giving all of the Mirim Lake to $FROMCOUNTRY$. Not ratifying this treaty might not result in an immediate invasion, but it is most probable.;;;;;;;;;
uru_brz_accept_desc;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has agreed to our border treaty. They have already begun demarcating a new border along the Quaraí and Jaguarão rivers.;;;;;;;;;
uru_brz_refuse_desc;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our border treaty! A response to H.M's proposal has arrived at $CAPITAL$ today and had all ministers of government shocked with the immense disrespect coming from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Such cockiness is unacceptable, and we shall deal with according. Push the border to Castilhos!;;;;;;;;;
tratado_lleras_lisboa_title;The Lleras-Lisboa Treaty;;;;;;;;;
tratado_lleras_lisboa_desc;Portugal and Spain failed to define a proper border in the Amazon, and we've inherited these century-old boundary disputes. So many countries claim the harsh soils of the Green Hell, and many haven't recognised our superiority and relinquished their petty boundary claims. One such territory dispute lies around the Japurá river, known in Hispanic nations as the "Yapurá" or "Caqueta" (specifically inside the old territory of Nueva Granada.) As many as four different countries claim these lands, including us. We reached a compromise with two of these nations in the last decade. However, one of them refuses to cooperate with our government. We might convince them to recognise our ownership of the Japurá by sending the Baron of Japurá, Miguel Maria Lisboa, and negotiate a compromise. If they still refuse to cooperate, there shall be consequences they might not enjoy.;;;;;;;;;
lleras_lisboa_desc;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed a boundary treaty with us to resolve the dispute between our countries in the Amazon. Accepting this treaty would result in recognising $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ownership over the Rio Negro and parts of the Caqueta river. In return, $FROMCOUNTRY$ would recognise our rightful claims east of the Apaporis.;;;;;;;;;
lleras_lisboa_refuse_desc;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our generous treaty. The Amazon shall stay contested between our two nations.;;;;;;;;;

green_hell_explain_desc;In GFM, any Amazonian and Matto Grossense land you (Brazil) own has a negative modifier named "The Green Hell." This modifier has three different tiers:\n§BFirst tier:§! Already present when you load a new game as Brazil. It contains a heavy penalty for immigration attraction (-500%) alongside smaller debuffs for assimilation (-30%) and RGO efficiency (-20%). However, it boosts RGO output and throughput by 30%.\n§BSecond tier:§! Unlocked with Organic Chemistry and Prophylaxis against Malaria. It has weaker debuffs for Immigration attraction, assimilation, and RGO efficiency. It does not increase the RGO output and throughput buff.\n§BThird tier:§! The last level is unlocked with the decision "Integrate the Amazon", It removes the immigration, assimilation, and efficiency maluses, turning them into buffs (20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively) while also increasing the output/throughput bonuses to 50%.;;;;;;;;;

green_hell_expand_desc;We have recently expanded our borders in the Amazon. They shall receive the organization necessary to, in the future, be incorporated into Brazil proper. Military colonies are currently being set up in the newly acquired land to maintain Brazilian control and pacify the feral Indians that still spread across the vast Rainforest. Before long, these lands shall be annexed to the nearby administrations of Matto Grosso, Grão-Pará, and Amazonas.;;;;;;;;;

green_hell_mid_event_desc;With the recent advancements in medicinal technology, such as Malaria prophylaxis, the Amazon rainforest and its surrounding regions are becoming less inhospitable. Though tropical diseases still run throughout all of Septentrional Brazil, it won't be long until we turn the barren riverside villages and towns develop into booming hubs of commerce for the untapped potential of the Amazon and its many natural riches.\nIn other news, recent droughts and hardships in the Northeast have also caused a boom in immigration to the now more friendly Amazon. Whilst this might be bad news for the provincial administrations of Pernambuco, Ceara, and other Northeastern provinces, it is a great boom for the regions of Amazonas and Grão-Pará.;;;;;;;;;
integrate_amazon_title;Integrate the Amazon;;;;;;;;;
integrate_amazon_desc;After hundreds of years of colonisation, our brave and just people have finally tamed the Amazon. No more do the tropical diseases, unruly Indians, and tropical floods pose a threat to settlement and exploitation of her resources. We have turned the barren and hostile Green Hell into a commercially booming Tropical paradise.;;;;;;;;;
integrate_amz_core_extra_desc;After expanding our territory in the Amazon, the local governments of Matto Grosso, Amazonas, and Grão-Pará have petitioned to annex the newly acquired territories. Doing so will make the administration and colonisation of these lands easier for Brazil's government.;;;;;;;;;
core_fuerte_olimpo_title;Claim the Fuerte Olimpo;;;;;;;;;
core_fuerte_olimpo_desc;§RGain 0.5 infamy§! Fuerte Olimpo is a fort on the Paraguayan river founded by the Spaniards in 1792 (then known as Fuerte Borbón). The Spanish designed it to keep Brazilian Bandeirantes and explorers out, protecting the Virreinato de Río del La Plata from further Brazilian excursions. Nowadays, the fort exists as a Brazilian free port controlled by the government of Paraguay.\n\nHowever, Paraguay's government is volatile at best. Their protectionist and isolationist policies make it difficult to protect Brazilian interests in the country, especially in the still unruly Gran Chaco. It might be best to assume direct control over the port, protecting Brazilian commerce in the region at all costs and expanding our influence in the Chaco.;;;;;;;;;
core_prg_chaco_brz_title;Advance into Bahía Negra;;;;;;;;;
core_prg_chaco_brz_desc;§RGain 4.5 infamy§! While we have assumed direct control over Forte Olímpo, other nations were faster at colonising the Chaco, which is unacceptable. We shall make known to these nations and the entire world that the lands of the Chaco are Brazilian.;;;;;;;;;

core_chaco_all_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! We're one step away from controlling the entirety of the Chaco region. Unfortunately, the Argentinian scum has gotten to Chaco Austral before we have. The Brazilian nation will not accept such arrogance from the government in Buenos Aires, and the entirety of the Chaco shall soon be ours.;;;;;;;;;
create_prn_title;The political emancipation of Paraná;;;;;;;;;
create_prn_desc;The autonomy of the Comarca de Curityba e Paranaguá, currently part of the province of São Paulo, has been brought up many times since its annexation into the Capitania de São Vincente. Politicians from the cities of Curityba and Paranaguá have questioned the central government since 1811, demanding autonomy from the government in São Paulo. \n\nRecently, the province of São Paulo, discontent with the conservative bias in the government, launched an armed revolt alongside the province of Minas Geraes against the government in Rio de Janeiro, causing some deputies to demand the emancipation of Curityba and Paranaguá as punishment for the 1840s Liberal revolts. Doing so, however, would make political leaders from São Paulo and Santa Catharina (the latter of which the Comarca has disputed lands with) quite angry at us.;;;;;;;;;
fra_border_suriname_title;The French-Surinam Dispute;;;;;;;;;
fra_border_suriname_desc;The boundary between the two colonies was mainly ignored throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The Dutch had loose claims to the regions west of the Sinnamary river until the Maroni river was decided as the boundary between the two colonies. \n\nRecently, colonists in the New World Settlement of Guyane have begun questioning what tributary of the Maroni should constitute the border between it and Surinam. The question is wheater the Tapanahony or Lawa rivers should be considered Maroni's headwater and, therefore, serve as the border between our two colonies. We should contact the Dutch government to form a mixed French-Dutch commission to settle this dispute peacefully.;;;;;;;;;
fra_dispute_suriname_title;Dispute the lands of Tapanahony;;;;;;;;;
fra_dispute_suriname_desc;A gold rush has struck the lands West of the Tapanahony tributary in Surinam. With it, the government in Cayanne has contacted us, urging the French Government to lay claim on the Tapanahony once again, recognising it as the righteous border between Surinam and Guyane. Doing so would upset the Netherlands and go against the previously agreed boundary between our colonies, the Lawa tributary, decided with a mixed French-Dutch commission not long ago.;;;;;;;;;
