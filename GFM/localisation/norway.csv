greater_norway_title;Norgesveldet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
greater_norway_desc;After the rise of romantic nationalism in Norway spanning from 1840 to 1865, the term "Norgesveldet" swept through the country reminding people of how great Norway used to be on the map! We colonized Iceland, we colonized Greenland and legend even has it that we even colonized Newfoundland before anyone else! Sweden robbed us of our past territories and our old deal with Novgorod to split the northern Nordics is invalid as Novgorod no longer exists. It's time to step away from the sidelines and once again become the great power our beautiful country deserves to be! The time has come to re-establish Norgesveldet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jemtland_rename_nor_title;Welcome back the people of Jämtland and Bohuslän;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jemtland_rename_nor_desc;The Swedes have been tricking Norwegians living in Jemtland and Båhuslen for too long. Heck, they don't even speak any Swedish, but rather Norwegian! It's time to welcome home our lost brothers in western Sweden who didn't even get Swedish citizenship before 1699 We tried to conquer the province back in 1677 and we were hailed as liberators by all of Jemtland, but the people need not fear anymore, because they're home now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iceland_rename_title;Welcome back the North Atlantic islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iceland_rename_desc;We've finally taken back what were robbed from us during the "Treaty of Kiel". The Icelanders have been gone from us for too long to keep the Norwegian identity at its fullest but there's still hope for the Faroese who arguably still speak a variant of the "Landsmål Norwegian" ("Nynorsk" today).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hebrides_rename_nor_title;Welcome back the Isles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hebrides_rename_nor_desc;These are territory we've lost during the middle ages. We even colonized them and the Brits have forcefully assimilated OUR people. The people living there may speak English, but they still got our blood and heritage in them! Now let's once again claim the cities in Ireland which WE established and governed in the first place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hebrides_rename_eng_title;Welcome back the Isles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hebrides_rename_eng_desc;We have finally thrown out the Scandinavian invaders off OUR islands which were honestly conquered through war and purchase!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jemtland_rename_swe_title;Reconquer Jemtland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jemtland_rename_swe_desc;We conquered these provinces thus we have the right to keep them since Denmark-Norway failed to protect their own people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
newfoundland_rename_title;Welcome back Newfoundland and centralize Labrador;;;;;;;;;;;;;
newfoundland_rename_desc;Technically, we never owned neither Newfoundland nor Labrador but WE discovered it. We discovered the whole continent for damn's sake! We traded and mingled with the natives before England even was a thing! It's about time we reconquered it. Markland is filled with native americans and would never feel Norwegian no matter what we do. We need to banish them and invite Norwegian fishers already living in Canada and promise Norwegians free land and quality of life in Markland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kola_rename_nor_title;Welcome back the Kola peninsula;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kola_rename_nor_desc;The Kola peninsula used to be a part of our tax domain but 1326, we signed a treaty with Novgorod splitting the area in 2. We got Finnmark, and they got Kola. Novgorod doesn't exist anymore making the treaty invalid! It's time to finally take back what's ours and improve the fishing industry in the area!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kola_rename_rus_title;Kola Reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kola_rename_rus_desc;We have retaken Kola from the Scandinavians, it is time to reintegrate it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAUTOKEINO;The Kautokeino Uprising of 1852!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAUTOKEINODESC;On the 8th of november 1852, 67 Samis lead by Aslak Hætta had rebelled in Kautokeino killing 2 Norwegians and burning down buildings! This was apparently because their family was imprisoned for not meeting up for the obligatory religious service we have kindly provided to them to make them civilized, instead they'd rather listen to the teachings of the controversial heretic, Lars Levi Læstadius who's trying to stop honest Norwegian merchants from selling alcohol to the Sami population. Oh and also, they feel "badly treated" because we're trying to civilize them by giving them our beautiful language and religion. How ungrateful people! Statsminister, what is your stance on this matter? We can implement Sami as a co-language to gain further support, should we ever for some reason conquer Finnish, Swedish or Russian territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ACCEPTSAMI;We need to share the nation with the Kvens and the Samis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fornorskningspolitikk;We are actively repressing Sami culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sapmi_rename_title;Reclaim the heartland of the Sami people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sapmi_rename_desc;After our acceptance of the Sami people, we honor them by naming our 2 new provinces after the Sami language. Afer-all, having Sami has a recognized language would never work if we don't promote them aswell, though if we ever own the Kola peninsula, it would be assigned for the Norwegian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_INDEPENDENCE; The Norwegian monarchy referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_INDEPENDENCE_DESC;Unionsoppløsningen (the dissolving of the union) is finally here! After hundreds of years of oppression, we're finally ready to show the world what we're worthy of, but to do that, we need to establish a government. 74% of our people have voted for a monarchy, the rest voted for republic. Whatever we choose, I think the people will be happy nevertheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_REPUBLIC;Establish a republic for the people! Monarchies have toyed with us for long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_MONARCHY;A constitutional monarchy to protect both tradition and democracy! (historical);;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_ABSOLUTE_MONARCHY;We need a king with firm control to maintain Norway's independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_provoke_swe_title;Strengthen the Norwegian military!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_provoke_swe_desc;Karl Johan is already pretty mad the we established 3 brigades of guards but this is not our problem! He began with beginning to break the Moss Convention by giving us less autonomy. This is just our way to defend the Moss Convention. We know that Karl Johan is a fanaticist when it comes to trying to annex us. Denmark's current king was our previous king in 1814 who unfortunately lost the war with us against Sweden. If we contact him, he'd surely help us and if we provoke Sweden to declare war, we could finally get our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_lang_decision_title;Time to take a stance in the language debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_lang_decision_desc;At the time, we have 3 written languages our people use. The upper class and the politicians uses Danish, the easterners uses Bokmål and the westerners and northerners uses Nynorsk. Our huge dialectal and sociolectal differences makes this hopeless. Our people can barely understand eachother and some can't!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_LANG;Time has come to decide the main language for Norway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_LANG_DESC;Ivar Aasen (left) is the spokesperson for his so-called "real Norwegian" being based on the language people in the countryside speak but he especially represents western Norway. Knud Knudsen (right) is the spokesperson for the Danish-influenced Norwegian often spoken by the upper class, the urban population and generally in eastern Norway. Aasen's variant is known as Landsmål/Nynorsk and Knudsen's variant is known as Riksmål/Bokmål. Aasen released his first dictionary in 1848 and Knudsen released his first dictionary in 1862. This is not just a language debate, this is a debate about choosing our identity! By choosing Riksmål, we will express our gratitude over our earlier Danish protectors but still praise our own sovereignity. By choosing Landsmål and moving our capital to our historical capital and most populated city, Bergen where they speak one of the closest dialects to Landsmål, we promote a patriotic and nostalgic style of government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RIKSMAAL;Knud Knudsen's Riksmål with Danish influence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LANDSMAAL;Ivar Aasen's Landsmål with Norse inspiration! (Enables assimilation of the Faroe Islands);;;;;;;;;;;;;

istanbul_rename_sca_title;Reshape the destiny of Miklagard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
istanbul_rename_sca_desc;Our ancestors traded so much in this city during the Viking age that we even gave the city a special name! "Miklagard" meaning "The Big City". Our people would love to make this romantiziced city ours and teach them our ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
northern_norway_fin_title;We have conquered northern Norway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
northern_norway_fin_desc;Even though we've never owned the area, we must free the Kven Finnish minority living in the north of Norway! (They were made into Samis for game balance purposes).;;;;;;;;;;;;;

grytviken_title;Lay claim to the south atlantic islands and offer to buy South Georgia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
grytviken_desc;No one ever lived properly on the South Georgia islands before thousands of brave Norwegian fishers went down there to live the whaling life. They even built a cinema and their own church, but due to British imperialism, the island unfortunately never became ours, but now we have the power to change history but not without diplomatic consequences from the Brits! To counter this, we're gonna send a request to purchase South Georgia and the Falklands for 30000 pounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
norwegian_whaling;Norwegian Whale Hype!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique_modifier;Profitable Textile Manufacturing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique;Norway's first factory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabriquedesc;"Haldens Bomuldsspinderi & Væveri" established in 1813 is said to be the first modern factory in Norwegian history. It all started with the ambitious 21 year old Mads Truelsen Wiel who went to Copenhagen in then Denmark-Norway as a student and got to hear about the abolishment of the textile import tax. This made him quite impulsively buy a weavery and modernise it to meet the time's standard. This had been his dream since he was 16 to establish a modern factory after he'd already inherited a huge business from his father! After Sweden formed a union over Norway in 1814, he got special permission from the Swedish king in 1815 to properly establish the factory in the city of Fredrikshald (Now "Halden"). After Mads died in 1835, he'd had a big impact on the Norwegian industry. The year is now 1836 and the business is owned by his son, Truels Wiel. Let's hope he knows what he's doing! (The next 10 years would prove to be very prosperous!);;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique_option;(Dye factory and coal is because it won't survive through 1836 if textile and fish);;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique2;The downfall of Norway's first factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabriquedesc2;Although "Haldens Bomuldsspinderi & Væveri" lasted until 1971, this would be one of its many downfalls. The new owners that took over the factory in 1845, Boesen and Leegaard had ambitious intentions and hired many new skilled workers and remodernised the factory, but this would unfortunately be their downfall as the investment turned out to be too much and the new production wasn't enough to pay it back. Historically, the factory survived this period but it's all up to you and the game now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique_option2;Bye textile mill that was definitely not a dye factory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfire;The entire city of Ålesund is in ruins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfiredesc;Only 1 person died in the fire but 80% of the city is destroyed. The most likely cause of the fire was a factory worker who commited arson but the wind got it out of hand even spreading the fire to other islands! The German emperor Wilhelm II has shown great interest in this fire and has offered to rebuild the entire city in 3 years! This will of course promote Norwegian-Prussian friendship but will overall strenghten their influence over our nation. If we choose to rebuild it ourself, it will certainly romanticize Norway's architectural ambitions. Either way, Ålesund will grow to become a beautiful city built on the premises of the very popular Jugend style of architecture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfire_option1;We will do without German help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfire_option2;We are eternally grateful for German help! (Historical);;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfire_destroyed;Ålesund in ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;

alesundrebuiltdesc;After 3 years of hard work, we can finally declare that Ålesund is rebuilt as one of the most modern cities in all of Scandinavia using the fabulous Jugend architectural style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundrebuilt_option1;Beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thranename;Marcus Thrane delivers a socialist petition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thranedesc;Marcus Thrane, inspired by the revolutionary sentiments of 1848 and his "Thranite movement" is the biggest political movement Norway has ever seen. He amassed a petition of 12833 signatures and a union of 30000 members. Him and his union's petition are stating: "universal voting, the extension of mandatory military service to those with property, equality before the law, better schools, low or no border taxes on necessary goods, such as grains, and special support for poor farmers in the form of arable land on reasonable terms". What do we want to do about this? | Marcus Thrane from Drammen would always be remembered in Norway and is mentioned by the popular Arbeiderpartiet (Labour party) as one of their founding fathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

gaelic_education_nor;The Gaelic Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gaelic_education_nor_desc;We now own a big chunk of the Gaelic world, thus we need to assess the situation about languages and cultures. We can develop a variant of Norwegian mutually intelligeble to our own but with slight Gaelic influences to try to appeal to the population. We could establish a Semi-autonomous entity in Scotland and Ireland based in Dublin and several language schools teaching slightly Norwegian-influenced versions of Scottish and Irish. We could also have central governance from our capital and language schools teaching a slightly Gaelic-influenced version of Norwegian, that would anger them a bit though because of the harsh treatment they'd just been through by the British. Whichever we choose, the Norwegian people will be really hyped to move to the beautiful farmlands of Ireland especially with its better climate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RISE_OF_STAVANGER_TITLE;The rise of Stavanger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RISE_OF_STAVANGER_DESC;During the early/middle part of the 19th century, Stavanger grew at unnaturally high rates. The reasons of this were a mix of rapid falling rates of infant mortality, the vast availablity of food because of the area having the biggest concentrated fertile farmlands in Norway and a sprawling fishing industry! The last 2 reasons would bring lots of immigrants to the city. Stavanger went from having 4800 inhabitants in 1835 to having a whooping 16100 inhabitants in 1855!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ASSIMILATE_FAROE_DESC;Faroese didn't begin to split from Norwegian before around 1400, but the linguistic choice we made for Norway chooses a Norwegian variant and path that longs back to the time before Norway became a part of any other nation, that being around 1400. Even though Landsmål still takes on a rather modernized version of old Norwegian, both Faroese and Landsmaal would be just as mutually intelligeble as Faroese and Icelandic. After months of the Faroe islands being under Norwegian control, the inhabitants have finally begun to understand this fact and are beginning once again embrace their Norwegian identity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
