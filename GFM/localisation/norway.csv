greater_norway_title;Norgesveldet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
greater_norway_desc;After the rise of romantic nationalism in Norway spanning from 1840 to 1865, the term "Norgesveldet" swept through the country reminding people of how great Norway used to be on the map! We colonized Iceland, we colonized Greenland, and legend even has it that we colonized Newfoundland before anyone else! Sweden robbed us of our past territories and our old deal with Novgorod to split the northern Nordics is invalid as Novgorod no longer exists. It's time to step away from the sidelines and once again become the great power our beautiful country deserves to be! The time has come to re-establish Norgesveldet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

sapmi_rename_desc;Having declared the Sami people a protected minority, we shall honor them by naming our 2 new provinces in the Sami language. After all, having Sami as a recognized language would be meaningless if we didn't promote its usage. However, if we ever own the Kola peninsula, we shall promote Norwegian immigration there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_INDEPENDENCE; The Norwegian Monarchy Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_INDEPENDENCE_DESC;The Unionsoppløsningen (the dissolving of the union) is finally here! After hundreds of years of oppression, we're finally ready to show the world what we're worthy of--but to do that, we need to establish a new government. 74% of our people favor a monarchy. The rest call for a republic to be established. Whichever we choose, the people will be happy regardless;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_REPUBLIC;Establish a republic for the people! Monarchies have toyed with us for long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_MONARCHY;A constitutional monarchy to protect both tradition and democracy! (historical);;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_ABSOLUTE_MONARCHY;We need a king with firm control to maintain Norway's independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_provoke_swe_title;Strengthen the Norwegian Military;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_provoke_swe_desc;Karl Johan is quite angry that we have deployed 3 brigades of guards--but his feelings mean nothing to us. He is at fault for violating the Convention of Moss, which established the personal union of Sweden and Norway, by cracking down on our autonomy. This is just our way to enforce the union's terms. We know that Karl Johan is a fanatic who dreams of annexing us, and it was only thanks to our defense in 1814 that our autonomy currently survives. Denmark's current king, Christian Frederik, ruled as our own king briefly during the war with Sweden in 1814 and abdicated after we lost. If we contact him and request his backing, he'd surely help--and if we provoke Sweden into declaring war, we could finally gain our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_lang_decision_title;Settle the Written Language Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nor_lang_decision_desc;At this time, we have three written languages our people use. The upper class and government use Danish, while easterners use Bokmål, and westerners and northerners use Nynorsk. The huge dialectical differences between regions is impeding our growth as a nation. We must decide which written variant of Norwegian we shall promote as the official one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_LANG;Time has come to decide the main language for Norway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOR_LANG_DESC;Ivar Aasen (left) is the spokesperson for his so-called "real Norwegian," based on the language people in the western Norwegian countryside speak. Knud Knudsen (right) is the spokesperson for the Danish-influenced Norwegian often spoken by the upper class--the urban population generally in eastern Norway. Aasen's variant is known as Landsmål/Nynorsk and Knudsen's variant is known as Riksmål/Bokmål. Aasen released his first dictionary in 1848 and Knudsen released his first dictionary in 1862. This is not just a language debate. This is a debate of identity. By choosing Riksmål as our language's standard, we will express our gratitude over our earlier Danish protectors while still proclaiming our sovereignty. By choosing Landsmål, however, we will promote a patriotic and nostalgic direction for our country. Naturally, choosing a standard variant of our language less influenced by Danish would arouse nationalism, which we could embrace by moving our capital back to its historical location, the city of Bergen. Bergen also happens to be where the dialect closest to Landsmål is still spoken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

grytviken_desc;No one ever lived properly on the South Georgia islands before thousands of brave Norwegian fishers went down there to pursue whaling. They even built a cinema and their own church, but due to British imperialism, the island unfortunately never became ours. Now we have the power to change history We will send a request to purchase South Georgia and the Falklands for 30000 pounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bomuldsfabrique;Norway's First Factory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabriquedesc;"Haldens Bomuldsspinderi & Væveri," established in 1813, is said to be the first modern factory in Norwegian history. It all started with the ambitious 21 year old Mads Truelsen Wiel, who went to Copenhagen in then Denmark-Norway as a student and got to hear about the abolition of the textile import tax. This made him impulsively buy a weavery and modernize it. He thus fulfilled his dream since age 16 to found a modern factory, using money inherited from his father's business. After Sweden formed a union over Norway in 1814, he got special permission from the Swedish king in 1815 to properly establish the factory in the city of Fredrikshald (now "Halden"). After Mads died in 1835, he created a big impact on Norwegian industry. His son, Truels Wiel, now runs the business after inheriting it. Let's hope he knows what he's doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique_option;May the profits abound!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique2;Norway's First Factory Faces Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabriquedesc2;Although "Haldens Bomuldsspinderi & Væveri" lasted until 1971, this would be one of its many periods of loss and stagnation. The new owners that took over the factory in 1845, Boesen and Leegaard, hired many new skilled workers and remodernized the factory. But this would, unfortunately, be their downfall, as they spent more money on the factory than they had, and they failed to pay it back through their income. Historically, the factory survived this period of decline--but will you continue to maintain it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bomuldsfabrique_option2;Bye textile mill that was definitely not a dye factory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfire;The Ålesund Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alesundfiredesc;Only one person has died in the fire, but 80% of the city is now destroyed. The most likely cause of the fire was a factory worker who committed arson. The German emperor, Wilhelm II, has offered to help us by paying to rebuild the entire city--ideally having it complete in 3 years! This will, of course, promote Norwegian-German friendship, but will overall strengthen their influence over our nation. It would be immensely praiseworthy Either way, Ålesund will grow to become a beautiful city built on the premises of the very popular Jugend style of architecture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

thranename;Marcus Thrane Publishes a Socialist Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thranedesc;Marcus Thrane, inspired by the revolutionary sentiments of 1848, has launched the "Thranite movement," the biggest political movement Norway has ever seen. He has amassed a petition of 12833 signatures and formed a trade union boasting 30000 members. His petition demands: "universal voting, the extension of mandatory military service to those with property, equality before the law, better schools, low or no border taxes on necessary goods, such as grains, and special support for poor farmers in the form of arable land on reasonable terms." \n\nHow should we respond to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

gaelic_education_nor;The Gaelic Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gaelic_education_nor_desc;We now own a large chunk of the Gaelic world. We thus need to assess our language policy in the Gaelic territories under our domain. We can develop and promote a variant of Norwegian mutually intelligible to our own, but with slight Gaelic influences to appeal to the population. We could also establish a semi-autonomous entity in Scotland and Ireland based in Dublin and several language schools teaching slightly Norwegian-influenced versions of Scottish and Irish. Finally, as a third option, we could establish central governance from our capital and language schools teaching a slightly Gaelic-influenced version of Norwegian. Whichever we choose, Ireland will prove highly attractive to Norwegian settlers, especially due to its climate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RISE_OF_STAVANGER_TITLE;The Stavanger Population Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RISE_OF_STAVANGER_DESC;During the early and middle portions of the 19th century, Stavanger's population grew at an extraordinarily high rate. The reasons of this were a mix of rapid falling rates of infant mortality, the vast availablity of food because of the area having the biggest farmlands in Norway, and a sprawling fishing industry. The last 2 reasons would bring lots of immigrants to the city. Stavanger went from having 4800 inhabitants in 1835 to having a whopping 16100 inhabitants in 1855.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ASSIMILATE_FAROE_TITLE;Faroese Assimilation Proves Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSIMILATE_FAROE_DESC;Faroese didn't begin to split from Norwegian before around 1400, but the linguistic choice we made for Norway chooses a Norwegian variant and path that longs back to the time before Norway became a part of any other nation, that being around 1400. Even though Landsmål still takes on a rather modernized version of old Norwegian, both Faroese and Landsmaal would be just as mutually intelligeble as Faroese and Icelandic. After months of the Faroe islands being under Norwegian control, the inhabitants have finally begun to understand this fact and are beginning once again embrace their Norwegian identity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

conquer_ireland_nor_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! During the Viking Ages, Ireland was largely populated with Norwegians, and the 5 main cities of Ireland at the time were founded by Norwegians, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Dublin. We are now on the position to reconquer Ireland, and regain our historical lands. (An event will pop up after the war giving you all of Ireland since scripting several casus bellis at once is impossible);;;;;;;;;
SCA_CONQUERED_IRELAND_EVENT_TITLE;Ireland is Under Our control!;;;;;;;;;
SCA_CONQUERED_IRELAND_EVENT_DESC;We have beat the greatest empire the world has ever seen, and now the Irish people will enjoy new leadership. From the 9th century to 1266 and in a lesser way up until the black death, Norwegians had huge influence on Irish and Scottish trade. Because of this, western Norway has arguably the highest concentration of redheads in Europe outside of Udmurtia, Russia and the British Isles.;;;;;;;;;
