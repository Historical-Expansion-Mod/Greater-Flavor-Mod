GCO_Claims_PBC_title;A stronger Hispanic America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCO_Claims_PBC_desc;Originally led by Venezuelan military Libertador SimÚn BolÏvar, Gran Colombia had fought to unite the New Grenadan territories with the Viceroyalty of Peru. JosÈ de San MartÏn, considered the Libertador for all of Peru, Chile, and Argentina, had his own plans for a united Hispanic America. Unable to put aside their ideological differences, both leaders went their separate ways. We are now in a position to invite the Peruvians and Bolivians into a political union and realize Bolivar's dream. After all, they named it "Bolivia" for a reason, didn't they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PBC_Claims_GCO_desc;JosÈ de San MartÏn fought alongside Libertador SimÚn BolÏvar to free and unite both the New Grenadan and Peruvian territories. However, while SimÚn Bol	Ïvar sought democracy, JosÈ de San MartÏn, a monarchist, had believed that an independent kingdom was necessary to govern the Andeans. Unable to put aside their ideological differences, both leaders went their separate ways. We are now in a position to invite the Colombians, Venezuelans and the Ecuadorian remnants into a political union and realize the dream of a united Hispanic America.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
Peru_rejects_GCO_desc;The Peruvian ambassador not only rejected our ultimatum to join Colombia, but stormed out of the conference room. We've heard word that the Bolivian government is in talks for a secret alliance with the Peruvians, perhaps even to reform the Confederation as an emergency coalition. It appears we are either forced to back down or escalate this to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

South_Andean_submission_desc; The war for control of the Andes is over! We have conquered both Peru and Bolivia and forced Chile to the negotiating table. Simon Bolivar's dream of uniting South America is close to completion. There is no denying that we will soon be the masters of Latin America. If the Platineans or Brazilians plan to take action, we must be prepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GCO_rejects_PBC_desc; The Colombian ambassador not only rejected our ultimatum to join the Federation, but so did the Venezuelans and what was left of the Ecuadorian assembly. Our intelligence department suggests this move may have undesired consequences, as there are now worries a resurgent Gran Colombia could be formed to stop our attempt at uniting the Andes. We have to either back down or destroy this threat before it can happen.;;;;;;;;;;

North_Andean_submission_desc;The war for control of the Andes is over, and while we can now project our influence throughout South America, our legimacy is not yet cemented. The Platineans and Brazilians have openly declared an alliance. If they plan to do retaliate against us, we must be ready for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

61008_desc;Despite the southern attackers and our own internal strife, the Confederation has prevailed. Nobody can deny the Peru-Bolivian Confederation its right to exist. Many in our administration believe the time is now to pursue our goals of a united Andean empire! Others fear we are not yet ready and need more time to stabilize. What path shall we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61009_title; DÏa del Mar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61009_desc;DÏa del Mar, which means "Day of the Sea", became an annual celebration in Bolivia that observed the loss of Litoral Department during the 1879‚Äì1883 War of the Pacific with Chile. The day is celebrated on the 23 of March, at the conclusion of the week-long Semana del Mar, with a ceremony at La Paz's Plaza Abaroa in honor of the war hero Eduardo Abaroa and in parallel ceremonies nationwide. Bolivia considers the D√≠a del Mar an opportunity to reiterate its claims for access to the Pacific Ocean that was lost when the country became landlocked following the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62003_desc;With threats like Brazil at our back door, we must decide the role our military will play in Gran Colimbia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62004_desc;It would be dishonest to suggest that the Catholic Church plays no role in our citizen's daily lives. It may be necessary to secularize in order to progress as a nation, but it could also help keep our people united to maintain religion in politics. This would be against Bolivar's wishes along with the goals of Andean liberals, but it might increase our support with the lower classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62005_desc;It began with an abrupt cut to diplomatic ties with Rio de Janeiro, and then a similar incident in Argentina. Our intelligence reports both nations are not only mobilizing their militaries, but the Argentines have seized Uruguay and Paraguay to "restore order" and "eliminate Andean influence" from their borders. Our worst fears have been realized, as the Argentine-Brazilian coalition has been formed to destroy us. If we don't hold them off, the Andean people may never recover from this dismantlement! To arms against our enemies, for The Andes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62006_desc;We have beaten back both the Brazilians and the Argentines in a miraculous upset! Forcing both nations into a treaty to settle our borders once and for all will not only cement the Andes as a powerful country, but also enforce our legitimacy as a Great Power, who will leave her own mark on this planet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

62009_desc;In 1833, General Santa Anna was elected to his first term as president and was, at the time of his election, in support of the federal republic. However, after some members of government angered Santa Anna's political allies, Santa Anna decided to start a centralized government. Santa Anna suspended the constitution, disbanded Congress and made himself the center of power in Mexico. States were converted into departments without political or fiscal autonomy by replacing elected governors with appointed ones and substituting for state assemblies with juntas under Santa Anna's policies. Dismayed by these policies and the perception that the government was deaf to the complaints and plight of the villagers in the North, Republic leaders aimed to expel the government-appointed centralist officials and restore the Constitution of 1824. On November 3, 1838, one of the republic leaders, Antonio Canales Rosillo, issued a pronunciamiento against the government and in favor of federalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62010_desc;On the 17 January 1840 a meeting was held at the Oreve√±a Ranch near Laredo. A group of notables from the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas advocated for a rebellion seeking secession from Mexico and formation of their own federal republic with Laredo as the capital. However, those states' own congresses and governments never took any action to support the insurgents, and requested the help of the Central government in Mexico City to aid the local state armies. Despite the lack of support from the state governments, the Republic of the Rio Grande was formed. The new Republic had an official newspaper: ‚ÄúCorreo del Rio Bravo del Norte‚Äù and their state motto was Dios, Libertad y Convenci√≥n(God, Liberty, and Convention).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62011_desc;In January 1839, Antonio Canales summoned a convention at the office of the Justice of the Peace in Laredo where the Constitution of 1824 was unanimously approved. Canales immediately began building an army and scoured the countryside looking for recruits, among those recruits were Texan Colonels Reuben Ross and Samuel Jordan. Intending to use the property of the church and convents to pay volunteers, In 1839 and 1840 Canales was able to freely travel both sides of the Rio Grande, and recruited a small army of both Tejano and Mexican vaqueros and Caddo Indians, as well as receiving the assistance of the Texian Auxiliary Corps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62013_desc;From the beginning, President Cardenas realized that the success of the Republic of the Rio Grande depended on Texan support. Texas also had conflicting interests on whether to support the new Republic or not. On one hand, the formation of the Republic of the Rio Grande would create a buffer state between Mexico and Texas, postponing any possible intentions Mexico had for the reinvasion of Texas. On the other hand, Texas needed Mexico to recognize its independence and supporting the new Republic would certainly anger them. Texas's official stance on the issue was neutral, but president Mirabeau Lamar secretly encouraged Texans to volunteer in Canales's army and gave Canales access to Texan arms and ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62015_desc;After the defeat at Saltillo, General Canales secretly entered negotiations with General Arista and on November 6, 1840, Antonio Canales surrendered at Camargo. Canales soon accepted a position as an officer in Santa Anna's army. As part of conditions of surrender, no harm would come to the property or safety of former members of the republic. The Republic's debts would be assumed as well. A few days after Canales's surrender, President Cardenas and other officials entered Laredo to officially surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62016_desc;Despite impossible odds, The Republic of the Rio Grande beat back the Mexican Centralists. President Cardenas held a speech today in Laredo, declaring the Constitutional draft submitted by congress approved. Essentially recreating the Mexican Constitution of 1824, the Federal Republic of Mexico would live on in spirit through our nation. During his speech, President Cardenas also extended amnesty for any Centralist supporters; they could leave Rio Grande and return to Mexico or they could live free, protected by the Federalist government. The United States has extended the hand of friendship, thus angering our Centralist oppressors. The Texans, no longer feeling like their hands are tied, officially recognize the Republic of the Rio Grande. It is a good day for our small Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62017_desc;It has been some time since our independence, and although we remain staunch allies with the Texas Republic, our borders in Laredo are not clearly defined. With the possibility of Texas joining the United States, many in both bodies of government suggest it is time to decide once and for all what is to become of the Laredo territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62018_desc;A few years have passed since the revolution, giving time for the Riograndese identity to flourish. Cities, banks, roads and customs have developed that, while still strongly hispanic and Catholic in nature, are distinct from Mexico's overt influences. Proposals have passed in local governments to rename formerly Mexican cities after some founding members of the Revolution. Ciudad Victoria, named after the first Mexican President, was proudly left alone as a reminder of what we fought for. The Republic of the Rio Grande's own cultural renaissance has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62019_desc;The question of reunifying with Mexico has been a controversial topic, both in our country and neighboring Mexico. When our country sought independence, it was against the oppressive Santa Anna and the Centralist regime which had sundered the 1824 Constitution. Now that some time has passed, many are wondering if the course of the country now steers us towards rejoining a Mexican Republic. Many others scoff at the idea, wishing to keep our young identity intact. This debate will linger for some time, leaving The people of the Rio Grande in a culture war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62020_desc;Amidst the debate between returning to Mexico and maintaining our independence emerges a third option, joining our Texan brothers and getting admitted as a U.S. state. There are very clear problems with this proposal, such as the distinct Hispanic and Catholic majority that goes in direct contrast to the American Protestants. Even more glaringly obvious is our opposition to slavery, which is a powder keg ready to set off in the American south. If we were to be admitted to the union, surely we would be turned into a slave state against our will. Even if that doesn't happen, our annexation would become a battle between the Republican and Democratic politicians. Of course, the benefits of US statehood include a guarantee of protection from Mexico, representation, and resources we can't access on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6202011_desc;The Republic of the Rio Grande wants to apply for US Statehood. While it would be more strategically valuable land, it would likely anger Mexico as well as the South. The state is already heavily populated with hispanics, meaning emmigration to Rio Grande will not be as ideal as the rest of the new states. Clashes between Mexicans and southerners could prove even worse than they already are, and with the union heading towards a very fragile state thanks to the Slavery Debate, we must consider this proposition carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62021_desc;The chaos in the Mexican states coupled with the American Civil War has left our people scared for the future. Could France come for us next? Can we rely on our U.S. allies during their tumultous time? It is crucial that we finally address the debate of unification versus independence:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62022_desc;The Republic of the Rio Grande, once a jewel of our country before its own revolution, has sworn off returning to Mexico forever. If we don't act now, our legitimacy on traditional Mexican lands will vanish forever. However, by taking them back we will surely suffer the wrath of the United States and any other sympathetic states. Can we afford to lose this battle forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62023_desc;The war is over. Mexico has once again been defeated. This was not just a victory by a single country, nor a single idea, nor even a single culture. Rio Grande has shown the world that we will not be silenced by aggression! Now that we've won, imagine what else we can accomplish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62024_desc;In a defeat worse in scale than that of the Texan revolution, Mexico is faced with international embarassment. Rio Grande not only secured total independence, but brought the United States and others down upon us. During negotiations, many concessions were given to both nations, and Mexico had to once again bend the knee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62025_desc; The Yankees have laid claim to Laredo despite our treaty with the Texans. This was cause for alarm until the U.S. ambassador called the situation a "misunderstanding" which would be corrected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
