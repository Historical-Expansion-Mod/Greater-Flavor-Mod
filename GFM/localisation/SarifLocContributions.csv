GCO_Claims_PBC_desc;\n\nOriginally led by Venezuelan military Libertador SimÚn BolÏvar, Gran Colombia had fought to unite the New Grenadan territories with the Viceroyalty of Peru. JosÈ de San MartÏn, considered the Libertador for all of Peru, Chile, and Argentina, had his own plans for a united Hispanic America. Unable to put aside their ideological differences, both leaders went their separate ways.

61009_title; DÌa del Mar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61009_desc;\n\nDÌa del Mar, which means "Day of the Sea", became an annual celebration in Bolivia that observed the loss of Litoral Department during the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific with Chile. The day is celebrated on the 23 of March, at the conclusion of the week-long Semana del Mar, with a ceremony at La Paz's Plaza Abaroa in honor of the war hero Eduardo Abaroa and in parallel ceremonies nationwide. Bolivia considers the D√≠a del Mar an opportunity to reiterate its claims for access to the Pacific Ocean that was lost when the country became landlocked following the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62003_desc;\n\nWith threats like Brazil at our back door, we must decide the role our military will play in Gran Colimbia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62004_desc;\n\nIt would be dishonest to suggest that the Catholic Church plays no role in our citizen's daily lives. It may be necessary to secularize in order to progress as a nation, but it could also help keep our people united to maintain religion in politics. This would be against Bolivar's wishes along with the goals of Andean liberals, but it might increase our support with the lower classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62005_desc;\n\nIt began with an abrupt cut to diplomatic ties with Rio de Janeiro, and then a similar incident in Argentina. Our intelligence reports both nations are not only mobilizing their militaries, but the Argentines have seized Uruguay and Paraguay to "restore order" and "eliminate Andean influence" from their borders. Our worst fears have been realized, as the Argentine-Brazilian coalition has been formed to destroy us. If we don't hold them off, the Andean people may never recover from this dismantlement! To arms against our enemies, for The Andes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62006_desc;\n\nWe have beaten back both the Brazilians and the Argentines in a miraculous upset! Forcing both nations into a treaty to settle our borders once and for all will not only cement the Andes as a powerful country, but also enforce our legitimacy as a Great Power, who will leave her own mark on this planet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

62026_desc;\n\nMany delegates across Colombia convened to decide on the future of the location of our capital city. While a fringe group argues in favor of keeping the capital in Bogota, many disagree with them. This would strengthen the hand of the centralists, which the rest of the groups donít like in the slightest. The second option is to move it to Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela. This is also not favored by other parties; they point out how Caracas would be unable to deal with internal problems since itís located in the far east of the country. These federalists could also cause problems themselves, instigating instability in the country. The third option is to move it to Quito, they argue that Ecuadorians were underrepresented throughout the existence of the nation, and from there, it would be easier to take control of Peru and Bolivia which Bolivar sought to do before his untimely death. The fourth option has a different point. They argue about moving the capital to Medellin, which is a small settlement, and renovating it with European-style buildings. This would give us a great opportunity to show others that we are willing to take a different step to ensure the survival of our nation. The fifth option is to take this even further and build a new city on the northern coast of Colombia, named after the founder of our nation. No expense will be spared to build this great city, and it will attract many foreigners to settle down. This would be the most expensive one, but the cultural and economic outcome of this option would pay off in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62027_desc;\n\nThe perfect opportunity reared its head. The mad general Santa Cruz forcibly united Peru and Bolivia into a chaotic union, and is now at war with the Chileans and Argentines. As it appears, the Andean front looks so grim that the situation has been worsened the political cohesion of the so-called ìConfederationî. Bolivar and Sucre may have failed to unite Peru into our country, but we may be able to destroy the Peruvian identity once and for all if we intervene right now! Still, we can refuse to intervene, but lose our chance at erasing the southern ambitions once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62028_desc;\n\nSupreme Protector Andres de Santa Cruz announced an end of the war in the Confederation, a cessation of hostilities between all powers and the complete and utter defeat of his ìenemiesî both in the North and the South. We have failed to destroy the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, and as a result our legitimacy to uniting South America has been tarnished. We now sit defeated and humiliated while those in the Andes and the world shift their focus away from Bogot· to Cusco, which is now viewed by the international community as the center of political experimentation in Latin America. Our country may enter a dark time, and we must now weather the storm that comes with defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62029_desc;\n\nAs expected, the ìSupreme Protectorî could not handle a three-front war and the Peru-Bolivian military forces have surrendered. Santa Cruz himself, whois suspected of fleeing to British or French lands, is nowhere to be seen. Due to this lapse in governance, the nations of Colombia, Chile and the Argentines have agreed to a total partition of the Southern Andes. Chile will take Boliviaís coastline, while the Argentines take control of the former Alto Peru territories. As for the rest of Peru, Colombia will absorb directly as should have been done a few decades ago. However, not all participants of the partition have been satisfied. The Empire of Brazil, despite having been given considerable concessions for a nation uninvolved in the conflict, seems uncomfortable with the annexations, particularly the Colombian spoils. As the Brazilian government eyes the border in the Amazonas, Acre becomes a region of rising tension. We must monitor this area with keen eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62030_desc;\n\nDespite the claims of the global press, the Chilean army took the brunt of the conflict and fought hard and valiantly. Meeting in Cusco with the Argentine, Colombian, and Brazilian representatives, Chile and the others officially partitioned the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. Chile was given the Bolivian coastline of Antofagasta and the region of Tacna as part of the treaty. Already, Chilean settlers and mining companies enter the new region in search of gold and homesteads. These gains have secured the northern border and ensured complete access to rich resources and made our economic advantage unchallenged. It is unlikely that Argentina will take any moves against Chile while Colombia now dominates the Northern Andes, however Chilean spies suggest discontent in the Brazilian government over Colombian gains. However, it is not a fight that Chile will have to worry about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62031_desc;\n\nThe Confederation in the Southern Andes was shattered, although a conference between all powers involved had been called, it seemed that Brazil's interests were an afterthought; It was true that they were given several border regions as well as a division of Acre and the Amazonas, but both Colombian and Argentine ambassadors seemed to chafe at the thought of the entirety of the Amazon falling into Brazilian hands. Further, the results of the partition haven't dissuased migrants and carpetbaggers from illegally crossing the new borders. One day soon, a permanent solution would have to be enacted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62032_desc;\n\nDespite the logistical problems plaguing the Argentine military and the weakened economy, Argentina, alongside Chile and Colombia, have succeeded at destroying Santa Cruz and the anti-government dissidents he was housing. Meeting in Cuszco with the Chilean, Colombian, and Brazilian representatives, Argentina and the others officially partitioned the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. We were granted our historical claim on Alto Peru, although the local populace is unlikely to welcome Argentine annexation. It will take time to secure the new northern frontier, while also keeping tabs on the developing discontent brewing between the Brazilian and Colombian governments. However, that is not a fight that Argentina will need to concern itself with!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62033_desc;\n\nSeveral years have passed since the Treaty of Cuzco and tensions have only escalated between the Empire of Brazil and the Colombians. First, it had begun with unauthorized trade from Brazilian merchants and hostile tribes. Then there were attempts to establish sovereign mining towns in Acre. With the unfettered influx of migrants speaking Portuguese into border regions as well as a general lack of respect for Colombian merchants in the region, the border was ordered closed by the Office of the Amazonas department of the Colombian government. It wasn't just Brazilian merchants and surveyors who were outraged at this, but the Brazilian border security officials who suddenly had to deal with a crisis of their own creation. Both governments are now tasked with a daunting task. Neither side appears poised to do anything about it, but sooner or later, it will have to come to blowsÖ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62034_desc;\n\nAfter years of border conflicts between rivaling settlers and tensions due to the Treaty of Cuzco, the Empire of Brazil has staged a local coup and seized our territory in Acre! They now announce that the entirety of the Amazon is Brazilian clay, promising to secure further lands near the heartlands of Colombia! If our military does not utterly decimate the Brazilian Empire, they will appear legitimate and our relevance will be forever challenged in Latin America! In order to insure a future led by Colombia, we must win the War for the Amazon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62035_desc;\n\nA group of filibusters hailing from Rio de Janeiro have massacred a platoon of Colombian soldiers and declared the îRepublic of Acreî in an attempt to seek annexation by the Empire of Brazil! In truth, the military had been secretly funding expeditions and dissidents across the border for years, although no one in both the military and the gendarmerie had expected them to succeed! This ìGran Colombiaî has now declared they will not concede Acre and are looking to take the entirety of the Amazon from us! If we do not utterly destroy the ambitions of these Bolivarists, our future dominance on the continent will vanish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62036_desc;\n\nWhat was once thought the pipe dreams of men too close to the sun has become a reality as Andean troops marched across Manaus and the eastern settlements of Para! The Brazilian army has been routed in embarrassing defeat after defeat until the Emperor himself called for an end of hostilities, much to the chagrin of his own military leadership who wanted to keep fighting until Colombian forces had reached the outskirts of the coast. With a new treaty signed, dubbed the Treaty of Manaus, what was done was done; ìGran Colombiaî took possession of all lands west of the Amazon river and reorganized the territory under the ìDepartment of Acre & the Amazonasî. The future of Colombia shines bright and now rivals even the likes of their Yankee allies to the North!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62037_desc;\n\nOur frontlines have collapsed and Colombian forces are entrenched in Manaus. We have completely lost control of the Amazonas, and as Colombian forces marched along Para and across the river, the Emperor himself stepped up and called for an end to the war. Dom Pedro II, seeking reconciliation and an end to the needless death of the nationís young men, signed the Treaty of Manaus with the Andeans to the north. The Colombians now own all lands West of the Amazon river, in the largest loss of land in the Empire of Brazilís history. Although a permanent peace has hopefully been established through this treaty, Brazil will never be the same as it once was. Many in government have started questioning the legitimacy of Pedro IIís rule because of this, and only time will tell how they will handle the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62038_desc;\n\nWhen the war began, both sides were unsure who would come out on top. The Brazilians and Colombians were, as European and American analysts stated, ìevenly matchedî. However, as the Brazilian army surrounded Bogota and besieged Caracas, the government of ìGran Colombiaî folded and surrendered. We have taken all of Acre as well as our claims on the Amazonas, drastically reducing the amount of rich lands and territory the Andeans have in their possession. Once again, The Empire of Brazil has established its dominance over the continent and the Colombians wouldnít dare threaten them again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62039_desc;\n\nWhen the battle for Caracas resulted in a total collapse of the military, most in command saw it as the final straw to push back the Brazilian Counteroffensive. It was said that some Generals began acting of their own accord, which the Brazilains took advantage of and seized the capital. Supply lines, having been sabotaged before the war by filibusters and the tribes funded by Brazilian money, were stretched beyond capacity. Federalistas and Centralistas in the military have already begun blaming one another as the President arrived to sign away what little portions of the Amazonas we possessed and all of Acre to the Empire of Brazil. The spirit of Colombia has been crushed today, as those looking gleefully to the unification of Latin America must now look away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62040_desc;\n\nThe Haitians, despite ejecting the French yoke from the island of Hispaniola, have become Imperialists themselves! The Dominican revolution has called for our help and we must answer with all the help we can provide. They were once promised a position in the Republic of Colombia and that promise will be fulfilled! Once we secure our rightful Hispaniola lands, we can turn our eyes on the rest of the Caribbean, specifically those who need our help in Cuba!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62041_desc;\n\nHaiti has been repulsed from eastern Hispanola, in large part due to North Andean blood and steel. Once, our government was forced to decline their request of annexation due to the haunting spector of colonial legacies and internal chaos. Today, however, as Pro-Colombian moderates oust their disloyal Monarchist rebels, the Dominican Republic cements its destiny as a member of the Colombian Republic! Just like Libertadors Antonio Valero de BernabÈ and SimÛn BolÌvar intended, Colombia and Dominicans will soon be one and the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
610062_desc\n\n;With the formation of the Peru-Boliva confederation, we have made many of our neighbors upset as they see us as a big threat for them. Now, rumours have been circling around that our northern neighbor, Gran Colombia, who recently fought in a civil war to keep their nations united, are planning along with the Chileans to invade us and then partition our union between them. Of course these are simply rumors but the threat that represent Chile and Gran Colombia are far too big to ignore. Now one politician suggest we should organize an emergency draft and prepare for the inevitable, but this will cause too much uproar on not only the rest of the nations in South America but also on our own citizens, what should we do?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62042_desc;\n\nIn a passionate speech at the US State of the Union Address, President Andrew Jackson expressed support for the Federal union of Colombia. Dispatching Senator Robert B. McAffee to oversee affairs in New Grenada, the ultimate goal of President Jackson involved plans for all participants in the conflict to meet in Bogota to perhaps iron out their differences. Jackson gave instructions to McAffee to maintain friendship and commercial ties to New Grenada throughout the process. Until then, America would remain without diplomatic relations with Venezuela and Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62043_desc;\n\nThe Platineans are in violation of our arrangements from the Treaty of Cuzco and Alto Peru is now fighting for it's life! Now is the time for Colombia to decide whether Bolivia is forgotten forever or joins our glorious union!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62044_desc;\n\nWe have managed to successfully defeat the Argentinians and defend Bolivia from being part of Argentina, now that the conflict has been settled, it is now time that Bolivia, a nation which has the name of our liberator, become close to the nation that gave them independence in the first place, the new President of Bolivia has complied and agreed to be part of $COUNTRY$ on the condition that they get a separate congress, monetary system and that he gets to keep control over Bolivia as a local governor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62045_desc;\n\nAfter years of Bolivia being part of Argentina as an autonomous province, it now has come to be part of Colombia as our autonomous province, however, as every year has passed, Bolivia has kept pushing for more autonomy from ours, now the Bolivian congress has reached a point in which they now are now pushing for full independence from ours, with the Bolivian local governor as their new president, claiming that Bolivia has spent too long being controlled by "foreigners" and now they want to choose their own path as a full independent country. When the news about this spread through the country, people in the streets, mainly the northeners are demanding for the direct annexation of the Bolivian state, while some of our politicians and southern indigenous people pushes for Bolivia to be left alone, with claims that Bolivia would be too much problem to control and that the indigenous people might suffer from oppresion and discrimination like the peruvian indigenous people has suffered for years, it is time to make a choice regarding the Bolivian question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62047_desc;\n\nA tragedy occured in the Guantanamo Bay, after the Colombian government had annouced their desire to finally liberate Cuba from Spanish control, a small group of militia with 1,000 men led by Fernando Gomez led an expedition on Guantanamo Bay, on the idea to convince the local people to join their campaign and liberate them from Spanish rule. But as it turns out, the expedition failed when a small spanish army who were already expecting a surprise invasion to Cuba, arrived to Guantanamo and attacked the expedition, resulting in 38 men killed and more than 300 captured along Fernando himself and a couple of civilians who joined their cause. Outrage spread out through the country, with the Colombian foreign minister on Spain demanding the liberation of the captured colombians, which ended up in the foreign minister being expelled from Spain, the assembly now has given the permission to the Colombian government to declare war on Spain. Is it now the time to finally expell the Spanish from the Americas and liberate our fellow soldiers who fought for what was right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62048_desc;\n\nAfter the Guantanamo Incident and the expulsion of the Colombian foreign minister, The Colombians did't found themselves happy for it, and now the Colombian government has now send an official declaration of War with the intent of taking away our islands from ours, though, many aren't sure if we can win against a strong Colombia, we must fight for our nation if it means to protect our national sovereign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

62009_desc;\n\nIn 1833, General Santa Anna was elected to his first term as president and was, at the time of his election, in support of the federal republic. However, after some members of government angered Santa Anna's political allies, Santa Anna decided to start a centralized government. Santa Anna suspended the constitution, disbanded Congress and made himself the center of power in Mexico. States were converted into departments without political or fiscal autonomy by replacing elected governors with appointed ones and substituting for state assemblies with juntas under Santa Anna's policies. Dismayed by these policies and the perception that the government was deaf to the complaints and plight of the villagers in the North, Republic leaders aimed to expel the government-appointed centralist officials and restore the Constitution of 1824. On November 3, 1838, one of the republic leaders, Antonio Canales Rosillo, issued a pronunciamiento against the government and in favor of federalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62010_desc;\n\nOn the 17 January 1840 a meeting was held at the Oreve√±a Ranch near Laredo. A group of notables from the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas advocated for a rebellion seeking secession from Mexico and formation of their own federal republic with Laredo as the capital. However, those states' own congresses and governments never took any action to support the insurgents, and requested the help of the Central government in Mexico City to aid the local state armies. Despite the lack of support from the state governments, the Republic of the Rio Grande was formed. The new Republic had an official newspaper: "Correo del Rio Bravo del Norte" and their state motto was Dios, Libertad y ConvenciÛn (God, Liberty, and Convention).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62011_desc;\n\nIn January 1839, Antonio Canales summoned a convention at the office of the Justice of the Peace in Laredo where the Constitution of 1824 was unanimously approved. Canales immediately began building an army and scoured the countryside looking for recruits, among those recruits were Texan Colonels Reuben Ross and Samuel Jordan. Intending to use the property of the church and convents to pay volunteers, In 1839 and 1840 Canales was able to freely travel both sides of the Rio Grande, and recruited a small army of both Tejano and Mexican vaqueros and Caddo Indians, as well as receiving the assistance of the Texian Auxiliary Corps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

62013_desc;\n\nFrom the beginning, President Cardenas realized that the success of the Republic of the Rio Grande depended on Texan support. Texas also had conflicting interests on whether to support the new Republic or not. On one hand, the formation of the Republic of the Rio Grande would create a buffer state between Mexico and Texas, postponing any possible intentions Mexico had for the reinvasion of Texas. On the other hand, Texas needed Mexico to recognize its independence and supporting the new Republic would certainly anger them. Texas's official stance on the issue was neutral, but president Mirabeau Lamar secretly encouraged Texans to volunteer in Canales's army and gave Canales access to Texan arms and ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

62015_desc;\n\nAfter the defeat at Saltillo, General Canales secretly entered negotiations with General Arista and on November 6, 1840, Antonio Canales surrendered at Camargo. Canales soon accepted a position as an officer in Santa Anna's army. As part of conditions of surrender, no harm would come to the property or safety of former members of the republic. The Republic's debts would be assumed as well. A few days after Canales's surrender, President Cardenas and other officials entered Laredo to officially surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62016_desc;\n\nDespite impossible odds, The Republic of the Rio Grande beat back the Mexican Centralists. President Cardenas held a speech today in Laredo, declaring the Constitutional draft submitted by congress approved. Essentially recreating the Mexican Constitution of 1824, the Federal Republic of Mexico would live on in spirit through our nation. During his speech, President Cardenas also extended amnesty for any Centralist supporters; they could leave Rio Grande and return to Mexico or they could live free, protected by the Federalist government. The United States has extended the hand of friendship, thus angering our Centralist oppressors. The Texans, no longer feeling like their hands are tied, officially recognize the Republic of the Rio Grande. It is a good day for our small Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62017_desc;\n\nIt has been some time since our independence, and although we remain staunch allies with the Texas Republic, our borders in Laredo are not clearly defined. With the possibility of Texas joining the United States, many in both bodies of government suggest it is time to decide once and for all what is to become of the Laredo territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62018_desc\n\n;A few years have passed since the revolution, giving time for the Riograndese identity to flourish. Cities, banks, roads and customs have developed that, while still strongly hispanic and Catholic in nature, are distinct from Mexico's overt influences. Proposals have passed in local governments to rename formerly Mexican cities after some founding members of the Revolution. Ciudad Victoria, named after the first Mexican President, was proudly left alone as a reminder of what we fought for. The Republic of the Rio Grande's own cultural renaissance has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62019_desc;\n\nThe question of reunifying with Mexico has been a controversial topic, both in our country and neighboring Mexico. When our country sought independence, it was against the oppressive Santa Anna and the Centralist regime which had sundered the 1824 Constitution. Now that some time has passed, many are wondering if the course of the country now steers us towards rejoining a Mexican Republic. Many others scoff at the idea, wishing to keep our young identity intact. This debate will linger for some time, leaving The people of the Rio Grande in a culture war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62020_desc;\n\nAmidst the debate between returning to Mexico and maintaining our independence emerges a third option, joining our Texan brothers and getting admitted as a U.S. state. There are very clear problems with this proposal, such as the distinct Hispanic and Catholic majority that goes in direct contrast to the American Protestants. Even more glaringly obvious is our opposition to slavery, which is a powder keg ready to set off in the American south. If we were to be admitted to the union, surely we would be turned into a slave state against our will. Even if that doesn't happen, our annexation would become a battle between the Republican and Democratic politicians. Of course, the benefits of US statehood include a guarantee of protection from Mexico, representation, and resources we can't access on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6202011_desc;\n\nThe Republic of the Rio Grande wants to apply for US Statehood. While it would be more strategically valuable land, it would likely anger Mexico as well as the South. The state is already heavily populated with hispanics, meaning emmigration to Rio Grande will not be as ideal as the rest of the new states. Clashes between Mexicans and southerners could prove even worse than they already are, and with the union heading towards a very fragile state thanks to the Slavery Debate, we must consider this proposition carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62021_desc;\n\nThe chaos in the Mexican states coupled with the American Civil War has left our people scared for the future. Could France come for us next? Can we rely on our U.S. allies during their tumultous time? It is crucial that we finally address the debate of unification versus independence:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62022_desc;\n\nThe Republic of the Rio Grande, once a jewel of our country before its own revolution, has sworn off returning to Mexico forever. If we don't act now, our legitimacy on traditional Mexican lands will vanish forever. However, by taking them back we will surely suffer the wrath of the United States and any other sympathetic states. Can we afford to lose this battle forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62023_desc;\n\nThe war is over. Mexico has once again been defeated. This was not just a victory by a single country, nor a single idea, nor even a single culture. Rio Grande has shown the world that we will not be silenced by aggression! Now that we've won, imagine what else we can accomplish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62024_desc;\n\nIn a defeat worse in scale than that of the Texan revolution, Mexico is faced with international embarassment. Rio Grande not only secured total independence, but brought the United States and others down upon us. During negotiations, many concessions were given to both nations, and Mexico had to once again bend the knee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
620255_desc;\n\nIn the late 1910s to the 1930s, American farmers began reporting the emergence of a new and destructive insect, the Black and Red Imported Fire Ant (BIFA & RIFA). Hailing from South America, these ants became notorious for their venomous stings as well as destruction to farmland, housing and machinery due to their nesting habits and rapid expansion. Likely introduced via global sea trade, both Solenopsis Richteri and Invicta represent one of the earliest contemporary accounts of invasive species that were accidentally introduced by human activity. The United States government would slowly attempt to eradicate these ants, dumping millions of dollars into operations and pesticides across the lands. With no natural predators and extreme adaptability, fire ants would go on to spread across North America and the Caribbean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
