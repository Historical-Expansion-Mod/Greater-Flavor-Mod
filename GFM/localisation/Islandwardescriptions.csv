ALANDISLANDS;\n\nThe Åland Islands are an archipelago located at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia. It comprises Fasta Åland, the largest island, on which 90% of the population resides, and about 6,500 skerries and islands to its east, of which less than a hundred are inhabited. The islands occupy a position of strategic importance, as they command one of the entrances to the port of Stockholm, as well as the approaches to the Gulf of Bothnia, in addition to being situated near the Gulf of Finland. The islands were part of the Kingdom of Sweden until they were transferred to the Tsardom of Russia in the 1807 Treaty of Fredrikshamn alongside all of Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTLANDISLAND;\n\nThe island of Gotland lies east of Sweden and is fully encompassed by the Baltic Sea. With a length of 125km, a width of 52km and a size of nearly three thousand square kilometers, its mainstay is not fishing but agriculture. The island was once covered in many marshes and bogs, but after Sweden took control over the island in the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, these were gradually drained to make way for farmland and pastures. Gotland commands a strategic position in the center of the Baltic Sea, and its largest city, Visby, possesses a large natural harbor that serves as an ideal naval base. The island also shows promise as a tourist destination: Socialites are increasingly visiting the island on holiday to go bathing at its many calm beaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OLANDISLAND;\n\nSeparated from the Swedish mainland by the Kalmar Strait, which is only 6km wide at its narrowest point, Öland is Sweden's second largest island with an area of 1342 square kilometers, though it is remarkably sparsely populated. While not enjoying the central position that Gotland has, Öland's location may be even more valuable than that of the former, as it still offers us a strong position in the Baltic Sea, while also allowing us to easily threaten Sweden. The island itself has historically always been a part of Sweden, being used as a royal hunting ground until very recently. When the its status changed, the administration of the isle's forests underwent a series of reforms to the dismay of the locals that relied on them to make a living. If we were to appease the local inhabitants, governing the island may prove easy, lest we risk turning the already disgruntled population against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BORNHOLMISLAND;\n\nStrategically located in the southern Baltic Sea, Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. It has usually been ruled by Denmark, but also by Sweden and by Lübeck. The ruin of Hammershus, at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest medieval fortress in northern Europe, testament to the importance of its location. The island is just under six hundred square kilometers in size, and its geology consists of granite, which is mined in numerous quarries. Bornholm's largest town, Rønne, is located at a natural harbor on its southeastern shore. It was fairly important during the Middle Ages, but has lost significance due to the general decline in Baltic trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUGENISLAND;\n\nLocated just off the coast of Hither Pomerania, Rügen is an island 52km wide and 41 km long, measuring nearly one thousand square kilometers in size. The 2km-wide Strelasund, a sound of the Baltic Sea, separates it from the mainland. It had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until its transfer to Sweden in the Peace of Westphalia after the 30 Years' War, returning to German hands with the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The island's beaches have been home to resorts since the 18th century, attracting increasing numbers of tourists. Rügen's many narrow peninsulas and seaside cliffs make it quite defensible. Its highest point, the 161m Piekberg, is crowned by the old Granitz hunting lodge, a residence of the local nobles, that has a tower from which the entire island and its surrounding waters can be observed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HELIGOLANDISLAND;\n\nHeligoland is a small archipelago in the North Sea located 46km off the coast of Germany.It consists of the namesake main island of Heligoland itself, where all of the inhabitants live, and the Düne, a small, desolate and uninhabited island to the east. Naturally, Heligoland's location offers a strategic but slightly exposed position in the North Sea, allowing it to be used as a launching point of hypothetical invasions of Germany, Scandinavia or even the Lowlands. Of course, some investments in infrastructure would need to be made. Heligoland was part of Denmark or Schleswig for most of its history, and was annexed by Great Britain during the Napoleonic Wars to prevent further French naval aggression in the region. With Napoleon permanently subdued, the island became nothing more than a tourist destination and refuge for revolutionaries from Germany and Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WESTFRISIANISLANDS;\n\nThe West Frisian Islands, also known as the Dutch Wadden Islands, are a series of 14 small stable barrier islands off the Dutch coast. Of the 14, only 5 are currently inhabited, with some of the uninhabited ones disappearing from time to time. The archipelago would grant us total control over half of the Dutch coast, while also being a useful naval base for any operation in the North Sea. As with the rest of the Wadden Archipelago, the West Frisian Islands will need quite a lot of investment if we want to make the most out of them. Considering the importance of the Dutch in European trade, effectively taking control of their coast could prove very worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EASTFRISIANISLANDS;\n\nA part of the Wadden Archipelago, the East Frisian Islands are an island chain located about 3.5km to 10km off the coast of Germany. They are 12 islands in total, of which more than half are currently inhabited. It must be noted, however, that they are not entirely stable, with locals affirming that some of the islands are still subject to movement and change caused by the ever-present tides and frequent storms. By acquiring the East Frisian Islands we would not only gain a strong position controlling the western German coast, but also a useful port in the North Sea, which we could use as a base of operations for our navy. The islands have historically been somewhat insignificant, never catching the attention of the great powers. Some of them only became inhabited by the 13th century, with many being used as havens for smugglers and pirates from the Middle Ages all the way to the Napoleonic Wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NORTHFRISIANISLANDS;\n\nLocated to the west of the North Sea coast of Schleswig, the North Frisian Islands are a small archipelago in the Wadden Sea made up of somewhere between thirteen and twenty isles depending on who you ask. The largest islands, Sylt, Föhr and Amrum, have non-marine sediments that make them less vulnerable to erosion, while Pellworm and Nordstrand are reclaimed marshlands protected by dikes. The other dozen or so islets are the so-called Halligen, which are unprotected from the elements and frequently flooded. The North Frisian Islands differ from the other Wadden Islands in that they aren't barrier islands, making them less susceptible to storms and high tides. Due to these more favorable conditions, the North Frisian Island could be easily used as a safe harbor and base of operations for our navy in the North Sea. The islands were first settled by Frisians and Danes around the 8th century, remaining under Copenhagen's control for over a millennia, albeit with more autonomy after being incorporated into the Duchy of Schleswig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MALTAISLAND;\n\nThe Maltese islands are strategically located between Sicily and North Africa in the central Mediterranean Sea. They consist of an archipelago made up of 3 large inhabited islands, namely Malta, Gozo and Comino, and numerous smaller outlying islets and skerries. Malta's strategic importance is immediately apparent, and controlling it would grant us an excellent naval base in the middle of the Mediterranean. Its central location paired with its size and defensibility would make it a valuable asset, especially considering the extensive port infrastructure and fortifications already built by the British, who took control of the islands in 1800. The archipelago's tumultuous history speaks to its significance and value: Over the centuries, Malta was controlled intermittently by the Byzantines, the Arabs, the Normans, Sicily, Spain, the Knights Hospitaller and Napoleonic France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELBAISLAND;\n\nElba is the largest island of the Tuscan Archipelago, which also includes six smaller inhabited islands and a number of rocks and skerries. Seizing Elba, located just 10km from the coast of Tuscany and about 50km from the coast of Corsica, would grant us great influence over the Tyrrhenian Sea. The island also possesses significant iron ore deposits that were already exploited in the pre-Roman era. Taking control of one of Italy's only domestic sources of iron would create greater reliance on foreign imports for steel production. Due to its strategic position and its inexhaustible mineral wealth, Elba has for millennia been coveted by the greatest powers of the Mediterranean. Control over the island was once disputed between the merchant republics of Italy, passing between Genoa, Pisa, Pombino and Tuscany, with Naples and Spain also staking claims of their own. In 1814, Elba became seat of Napoleon's first exile, before finally being given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany after the Congress of Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FERNANDOPOISLAND;\n\nThe island of Fernando Po, also known as Bioko, is located approximately 32km from the coast of Africa in the Bight of Benin. At just over two thousand square kilometers, it is of relatively reasonable size, having a length of 70km and a width of 32km. While Bioko may not have a central position in the Atlantic like Saint Helena or Ascension, the island is nonetheless well positioned in the middle of the Bight of Benin, thus allowing our navy to exert influence over valuable areas of the West African coast. Navigator Fernão do Pó first spotted the island in 1472 and named it after himself, claiming it for Portugal, which lead to the creation of sugar plantations with an output so massive that they briefly dominated European markets. Portugal ceded the island to Spain under the 1778 Treaty of El Pardo, whereupon Spain leased the island to Britain in 1827 as an outpost for combating the slave trade, proving the its utility as a naval base.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAOTOMEISLAND;\n\nThe islands of São Tomé and Príncipe are part of a volcano chain, the Cameroon Line, featuring striking rock and coral formations, rainforests and beaches. Both islands are surrounded by a total of six uninhabited islets too small to support economically gainful development. São Tomé, which is home to the most population, is located about 150km southwest of Principé. Their location at the Gulf of Guinea would provide a strong position on the coast of Africa, although conditions on the islands may prove a challenge to the construction of proper naval infrastructure. Under our control, they could become a pivotal naval asset to our growing empire. After being discovered by the Portuguese in 1470, the islands were first settled in 1493, leading to the establishment of numerous sugarcane plantations, forming the lucrative backbone of their economies to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FERNANDOISLAND;\n\nFernando de Noronha is the name of an archipelago consisting of 21 islands located 350km from the coast of Brazil. The islands were first discovered by Portuguese merchant Fernão de Loronha in 1503. In the centuries thereafter, brief occupations by the Germans, English, Dutch and French occurred, before the archipelago was finally retaken by the Portuguese in 1739. In recent times, Fernando de Noronha has been visited by a number of British scientific expeditions. It has also begun to be used as a penal colony. After the explusion of the convicts, the archipelago could be converted into a useful naval base to expand our influence in South America, thus extending the range of our navy in the South Atlantic and enabling us to definitively assert our position in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRINDADEISLAND;\n\nThe Trindade and Martim Vaz Archipelago is known as the most remote part of Brazil. It is located around 1025km from the mainland in the southern Atlantic Ocean and is only ten square kilometers in size. Consisting of five islands, as well as several rocks and stacks, the archipelago is extremely desolate and of volcanic origin. First discovered by Portuguese explorer Estêvão da Gama in 1502, the islands remained at least nominally Portuguese until Brazilian independence in 1822. There were attempts by Britain to take the islands in 1700 and 1781, demonstrating their strategic value. Significant investment would certainly be required to construct a naval base of significant capacity. As the archipelago is located far from the Brazilian coast, it would grant us the ability to interdict naval traffic in the South Atlantic and along the Brazilian coastline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHILOEISLAND;\n\nChiloé is the largest island of the eponymous Chiloé Archipelago. It is 190km long, 65km wide and more than eight thousand square kilometers in size. Most of the island's settlements are located on the less remote eastern and northern shores, where the minimum distance from the Chilean mainland is only 2.5km at the Chacao Channel. Although Chiloé has been inhabited by the Chono and Huilliche peoples for millenia, Spain established its first settlement in 1567 with the founding of the city of Castro. Although Chile declared independence in 1813, Chiloé remained a royalist holdout until it was finally wrested from Madrid's control in 1826. In recent years, the island has gained importance as a port of call for whaling vessels. Chiloé would make for an excellent naval base, as its separation from the mainland and its remote location make it easy to hold, while also giving our navy a powerful position in the South Pacific, the Strait of Magellan and the western coast of South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EASTERISLAND;\n\nThought to be one of the most isolated places in the world, Easter Island, also known by its native Polynesian name of Rapa Nui, is located about 2000km away from the closest European settlement, in the Pitcairn Islands. Easter Island was named by Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen who came across it on Easter Sunday 1722. Beginning in the late 18th century, it was visited by Europeans many times, with some unfortunate raids by Peruvian slavers that let loose a smallpox epidemic on the island. The arrival of missionaries on the island lead to an outbreak of tuberculosis, leaving less than a thousand natives remaining. Since then, Rapa Nui has become an object of interest to the British, the French and even the Germans, though the Chilean government was able to take possession of the island before any other claims could be staked. Despite its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, Easter Island could empower us to expand our influence in the Polynesian region if we were to invest in constructing a large naval base from which to project power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GALAPAGOSISLANDS;\n\nThe Galapagos Islands are a volcanic archipelago separated from the mainland of South America by 900km of the Eastern Pacific. In total, the group consists of 127 islands, rocks and islets that have a total area of just over eight thousand square kilometers. They were first discovered in 1535, when the bishop of Panama, Fray Tomás de Berlanga, was blown off course on the way to Peru. In the centuries thereafter, the arid and barren archipelago was left uninhabited, though pirates and whalers made use of it from time to time. With permanent settlement establishing itself in the 1830s, the islands have garnered increasing attention from naval powers, as they make for an excellent naval base that projects power both towards the isthmus of Panama and to the western coast of South America as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAVASSAISLAND;\n\nLocated 55km away from the westernmost point of Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, Navassa Island is a small limestone islet little more than five square kilometers in size. Though it was discovered by Colombus' fourth voyage in 1504, Navassa was not settled until this century, as is it is too small and desolate to support a population. In recent years, however, the island has garnered increased attention, as it is known to be inhabited by large seabird colonies, which have produced large deposits of valuable guano, a highly effective fertilizer. The island is not of any strategic value, as it offers no ports or harbors, meaning that all ships must anchor offshore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MASSAWAISLAND;\n\nThe island of Massawa is located just off the Eritrean Coast and about 50 kilometers from the Dahlak Archipelago, which we would seize alongside it. Its location in the middle of Red Sea paired with the increasing importance of said waterway means that the islands would be of immense value, allowing us to easily interdict euroasiatic trade and prevent the passage of enemy vessels trying to pass through the region. Taking possession of the islands would even allow our ships to operate along the Arabian Coast and Horn of Africa, enabling us to further expand our influence in the region. Massawa and the Dahlak Archipelago have long been a bridge between Arabia and the Horn of Africa, with Muslim sultans and Christian rulers from the Ethiopian Highlands having fought over their control time and again. The islands were conquered by the Ottomans after their conquest of Mamluk Egypt. An attempt was made at using them to take control of the Eritrean coast, but the hostile local tribes repelled any forays made, leaving the Ottoman garrison afraid to set foot on the shore at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BAYISLANDS;\n\nThe Bay Islands are an archipelago off the Caribbean coast of Honduras in Central America. It consists of eight islands and 53 minor cays lying 15 to 60 kilometers away from the mainland, close enough to be seen with the naked eye. Although aquiring the Bay Islands would probably put us at odds with Honduras and the other Central American nations, they would grant us a powerful position in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. The first European to spot the archipelago was Christopher Columbus on his last voyage in 1502. In the following years, it became the target of slave raides, causing the native population to rapidly decline. The English attempted to settle the islands in 1638, the beginning of English interest that continues to the present. In the following century, freebooters that targeted Spanish colonial settlements and shipping used the islands as a refuge for their ships and as a base of operations, demonstrating their strategic value and their potential to project power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANANDRESISLAND;\n\nThe archipelago of San Andrés and Providencia consists of two island groups and eight outlying banks and reefs in the Caribbean Sea about 190km east of the Mosquito Coast. Spain first claimed the islands in 1540, though it would take several centuries for them to be settled. They were initially administered by the Captaincy General of Guatemala, then transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1803, leading to a long-standing dispute that continues to this day. The islanders' main occupations are fishing and agriculture, which is surprisingly diverse. Crops include coconuts, cotton, corn, avocados, sugarcane, mangos, oranges, yams, noni, cassava, papayas, sweet potatoes, pineapples, beans and tobacco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARGARITAISLAND;\n\nMargarita Island is situated off the northeastern coast of Venezuela. It is just over one thousand square kilometers in size, and of volcanic geology. In the 21km strait separating it from the South American continent, there lie another two smaller isles, Cubagua and Coche. The local economy consists of fishing, agriculture and the keeping of livestock. It is blessed with generous fresh water, bountiful soils and plentiful shoals. Columbus came across Margarita Island in 1498, and the first Spanish settlement was established in 1529. Besides brief occupations by rogue conquistadors and pirates, the island remained Spanish until the collapse of the Spanish colonial empire in 1810.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAINTPIERREISLAND;\n\nThe archipelago of Saint Pierre and Miquelon is made up of 8 islands, of which the the two largest give it its name. The islands, amounting to just under two hundred and fifty square kilometers in size, are bare and rocky, with steep coasts, and only a thin layer of peat to soften the hard landscape. Portuguese explorer João Fagundes was the first European to land on the archipelago in 1520. Permanent settlement on the largest islands, St Pierre and Miquelon, was established by French fishermen in the mid-17th century. France retained the islands as their only North American possession at the end of the 7 Years' War. The British expelled all settlers during the American and French Revolutions as well as the Napoleonic Wars, leaving the islands desolate, though they have since been resettled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QUEENCHARLOTTEISLANDS;\n\nThe Queen Charlotte Islands are located 55-125km west of British Columbia, separated from it by the shallow Hecate Strait. To the north and south, the Dixon Entrance and Queen Charlotte Sound respectively lie between the islands and the Alexander Archipelago as well as Vancouver Island. The Queen Charlotte Islands consist of two main isles: Graham Island in the north and Moresby Island in the south, along with approximately 400 smaller islands with a total landmass of over ten thousand square kilometers. At present, the main economic activities are fishing and logging, but output remains meager due to low population density and the near-total lack of infrastructure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANTACATALINAISLANDS;\n\nThe Channel Islands Archipelago, located off the southern coast of California, is made up of 8 islands. The four northern islands, which are San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Anacapa, form a chain and are located close together, while the four southern islands, named San Nicolas, Santa Barbara, San Clemente and Santa Catalina, are scattered further apart from one another. In sum, they are about 900 square kilometers in size. Santa Catalina, the third largest island, was the first to be mapped by Europeans when a Portuguese explorer named it San Salvador in 1542. It was later renamed in honor of Saint Catherine by the Spanish in 1602. With the Spanish colonization of California, many of the archipelago's native inhabitants either died of disease or were forced on the mainland, leaving very few survivors. The Channel Islands possess several natural harbors that could easily be used as naval bases, giving us the ability to strengthen our influence in the region and allowing us to blockade some of the largest ports on the Pacific coast of the Americas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCILLYISLANDS;\n\nForty kilometers to the west of Land's End, the westernmost point of Cornwall, there is a small archipelago named the Isles of Scilly. Made up of 145 islands and rocky islets, they only measure sixteen square kilometers in size. The majority of inhabitants live on one island, St Mary's, of which close to half live in the largest settlement, Hugh Town. The remainder live on the four inhabited 'off-islands', namely Tresco, St Martin's, St Agnes, and Bryher. The locals rely on trade with the mainland to sustain themselves, working variously in kelp harvesting, pilotage, smuggling, fishing and shipbuilding. The islands have served as a place of exile many times throughout history, from the Roman period to the English Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHANNELISLANDS;\n\nLocated around 10km west of the Norman Cotentin Peninsula, the Channel Islands are an archipelago of 7 inhabited islands and 14 uninhabited islets in the eponymous English Channel. The archipelago's proximity to the coast of France puts it in a somewhat precarious position, but it is easy enough to control with adequate naval protection. A traditional a part of Normandy, the islands have been under the English crown ever since the Norman Conquest in 1066, with brief French occupations in 1338 and 1461 during the War of the Roses. The islands have remained under British control in the centuries since, even during the Napoleonic Wars. France finally dropped its claim to the archipelago at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Despite close to 800 years of English control, the inhabitants of the Channel Islands still speak Jèrriais and Guernésiais, dialects of Norman French used on the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISLEOFMAN;\n\nBetween Great Britain and Ireland, in the center of the Irish Sea, there lies an island known as the Isle of Man. It is almost six hundred square kilometers in size, measuring 53km in length and 21km in width. It has experienced many centuries of English rule, having been taken from the Scottish in 1346. The isle's economic mainstays are fishing and agriculture, though it is also home to a small mining industry. The Foxdale Mines, opened in 1724, are the most productive zinc mines in the entirety of the British Isles. The Manx people speak their own language, which is mutually intelligible with Irish and Scots Gaelic, though it has been on the decline for centuries in favor of English.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHETLANDISLANDS;\n\nAbout 170km northeast of Scotland there is an archipelago called the Shetland Islands. It has an oceanic climate, complex geology, rugged coastline, and many low, rolling hills. In all, the Shetlands are made up of about 300 islands and skerries, amounting to an area of nearly one thousand five hundred square kilometers, a thousand of which belong to the largest island, ironically named 'the Mainland'. The archipelago fell under Scottish rule in 1469, when it was ceded by the Kingdom of Norway. Shetlanders are known to have impressive nautical skill, as they have centuries of experience in fishing. Many have made a name for themselves by putting their expertise to use in the Royal Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISLEOFWIGHT;\n\nSeparated from Hampshire by the Solent, a strait 4-8km in width, the Isle of Wight is England's largest island at nearly four hundred square kilometers. It has played an essential part in the defense of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth and has been near the front line of conflicts through the ages, having faced the Spanish Armada. Though the island was last invaded by the French in 1545, the British government has built many fortifications on it over the centuries, hoping to defend against any possible future landings. The Isle of Wight is mostly rural, with most people employed in farming, fishing, or boat-building, although a small tourist sector has formed of late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONGISLAND;\n\nWith a land area of a little over three thousand six hundred square kilometers, Long Island is the largest island in the contiguous United States. It extends 190km eastward into the ocean from New York Harbor with a maximum north–south width 37 km. It also possesses a ring of barrier islands that extend for 75km along its south shore, known as the Outer Barrier. Long Island was first settled by Europeans in 1640, when the town of Southold was established by the Rev. John Youngs from Connecticut. Most of the population is currently concentrated on its western end, close to the island of Manhattan. The rest of the island is rural and primarily devoted to agriculture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COMMANDERISLANDS;\n\nThe Commander Islands, called Komandorskiye Ostrova in Russian, are a series of islands in the Russian Far East, a part of the Aleutian Islands, located about 175 km east of the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Bering Sea. Treeless and sparsely populated, the islands consist of Bering Island, Medny Island, and fifteen islets and rocks. There is only one permanently inhabited settlement, Nikolskoye, a miserable hamlet with a population of a couple hundred. Though the island group is part of the Aleutian volcanic arc, the next island in the chain, Attu, is located over 300km further east. The Commander Islands received their name from Commander Vitus Bering, whose ship wrecked on the then uninhabited Bering Island on his return voyage from Alaska in 1741. He died on there along with much of the crew. Though the islands are desolate and destitute, they could still serve as a naval base of some utility, giving us the ability to extend our influence in the Bering Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PESCADORESISLANDS;\n\nThe Pescadores Islands are an archipelago of 90 islands situated in the Strait of Fokien roughly 50 kilometers away from Formosa's western coast. The largest island of Magong is home to a temple to the goddess Mazu, as well as the settlement of Makeng. Numerous smaller islands, such as Baisha and Xiyu make up the rest of the archipelago. The islands were already settled by Chinese fishermen in 1171, however they were only formally incorporated into China in 1281 during the Yuan dynasty. They have remained under Imperial Chinese control in the centuries since, with the exception of a brief occupation by the Dutch East India Company in the seventeenth century. The main economic activity is fishing, as there is not much arable land available. In truth, the archipelago's value is not in its economy or its people, but in its strategically vital position. It controls the sea between Formosa and the mainland, being able to interdict shipping between the two, and importantly also that which goes between the East and the South China Seas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OKIISLANDS;\n\nThe Oki Islands, a small archipelago about 43 nautical miles north of Honshu in the Sea of Japan, are made up of the remains of two stratovolcanoes that have eroded over millions of years. The largest island, Dogo, with the highest point, Mount Daimanji, at 608 meters, makes up one of the volcanoes, while the three smaller islands of Nishinoshima, Nakanoshima and Chiburijima are the remains of the other volcano, which collapsed and split in three. Additionally, there are over 180 smaller outlying islets, rocks and skerries surrounding the four main islands. In total, the Oni Islands have an area of just under 350 square kilometers. Historically, the remote archipelago, which has been a part of Japan since at least the seventh century, has served as a place of exile for multiple deposed emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHURIYAMURIYA;\n\nThe Khuriya Muriya Archipelago is a group of five islands located forty kilometers south of the Arabian Peninsula's Dhofar region. The islands are sparsely populated, with the local inhabitants subsisting off of herding goats, catching birds and fishing. Due to the granite geology and the dry climate, the archipelago is barren apart from some tufts of grass and moss, allowing no agricultural usage. Due to the hostile environment, establishing a naval base would not be a simple matter. It has been noted, however, that the islands possess significant deposits of guano, a valuable fertilizer, of which there are estimated to be hundreds of thousands of tons. The guano could potentially be mined, shipped to Europe and sold at a hefty profit. It has also been proposed that the islands could serve as a base for a telegraph connection between Yemen and India, which could link up the European telegraph network to the Indian subcontinent. In addition to these potential uses, the archipelago would most certainly grant us greater influence over the Arabian Peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SADOISLAND;\n\nLocated 32km from the Japanese coast, the island of Sado is one of Japan's largest if one excludes the four main islands of the Japanese Archipelago. The island, which has been inhabited for at least ten thousand years, has been a part of Japan since at least the seventh century AD. The island remained a backwater for a millennium, being used at times as a place of exile for influential figures and even an emperor. This came to an end when the island was conquered by the Uesugi clan in 1589, which led to the discovery of gold in 1601. The island's bountiful mines produce gold to this day, and there have been no signs of depletion, especially now that more modern excavation techniques have made previously inaccessible deposits available. By virtue of its mineral resources, Sado has been an important source of income for the Japanese government for many centuries. Annexing Sado would not only allow us to deprive Japan of a significant source of income, it would additionally grant us a naval base in the Sea of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TSUSHIMAISLAND;\n\nThe Tsushima Archipelago, which lies halfway between Japan and Korea in the center of the Korea Strait, is made up the main island of Tsushima, which is divided in half by a canal, and over 100 small islets. The island has historically always been considered a part of Japan, becoming an official province in the early sixth century AD. Due to its fortuitous position inbetween Japan and Korea, Tsushima has always been a major center of trade. This linchpin of the Japanese Archipelago's defense was invaded by the Mongols and the Koreans during the Middle Ages, both of whom seized the island but failed to reach Japan itself. This demonstrates Tsushima's vital role both in defending and threatening Japan. If we were to take control of it, we would obtain a powerful strategic position in the region, thus depriving Japan of one of its most important defensive lines and granting our navy navy massive influence in the East China Sea, the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHEJUISLAND;\n\nWith a length of 73km and a width of 31km, Cheju is Korea's largest island, measuring in at a total of nearly two thousand square kilometers. It lies in the Korea Strait, about 80km south of the nearest point on the Korean Peninsula. Until the year 938, the island was an independent kingdom called Tamna when it became a vassal state of Korea under the Goryeo dynasty. The kingdom was finally brought to an end when the island was placed under firm central control in 1404 by Taejong of Joseon, leaving it under Korean control for over 400 years. Cheju is of volcanic origin, dominated by Hallasan: a volcano almost 2000m high and the tallest mountain in southern Korea. Its size as well as its strategic position somewhat removed from the mainland but simultaneously close enough to threaten the nearby coasts make it a valuable base of operations in the East China Sea and the Korea Strait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOCOTRAISLAND;\n\nSocotra, locally know as Saqatri, is an island in the Indian Ocean located almost 400 kilometers east of the Horn of Africa. It is the main island of an archipelago of the same name. With an area of almost four thousand square kilometers, Socotra comprises 95% of the landmass of the eponymous archipelago, which consists of the four larger islands of Socotra, Darsa, Samha and Abd al-Kuri, as well as three small islets to the north. The archipelago is home to some of the most unique and unusual species in the world, with a third of its plant life being unique to the islands. Socotra's geography is also noteworthy, being divided into narrow coastal plains, a limestone plateau and the Hajhir Mountains. The islands, which are traditionally a part of Yemen, were occupied by the Portugese for four years at the start of the 16th century, after which they reverted to the control of the Mahra Sultanate. Socotra's position at the tip of the Horn of Africa would be perfect for a naval base, interdicting the passage from the Read Sea to the Indian Ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QESHMISLAND;\n\nQeshm is an arrow-shaped island in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, measuring roughly 1,500 square kilometers in surface area. Separated from the Iranian mainland by the Clarence Strait, Qeshm is the largest island in the Persian Gulf. The city of Qeshm, located at the easternmost point of the island, is 22 kilometers from the mainland port of Bandar Abbas, while the closest point of the island is but two kilometers from the mainland. On account of its strategic geopolitical situation near the mouth of the Persian Gulf, it has been frequently attacked by invaders, including the Ilamids, Umayyads and Abbasids, as well as the Portuguese, English and Dutch. The inhabitants' leading occupation is fishing, as there is little cultivated land, though some dates and melons are grown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHUSANISLANDS;\n\nThe Chusan Islands are a group of some 400 islands in the East China Sea, located at the entrance of the Hangchow Bay. The islands have steep and rugged geography with elevations of up to 250 meters. This is due to them being the submerged continuation of the mountain ranges in Fukien and Chekiang. Due to the amount of silt discharged from the mouth of the Yangtze River many of the islands are surrounded by mud banks. The archipelago was brought under Chinese administration in the 8th century, with one of the smaller islands becoming an important Buddhist center. It became a place of pilgrimage during the Song Dynasty due to the belief that it had a connection to Avalokitesvara, the goddess of mercy. Some of the monasteries were looted in a Dutch raid in 1661. Currently, the islands have become an important part of the trade in the area. Their position on the eastern Chinese coast would allow us to strengthen our influence on Shanghai and the Yangtze Delta, as well as eastern China as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CORSICAISLAND;\n\nLocated around 90km from Tuscany, the island of Corsica is the Mediterranean's 4th largest island, with a sizeable population to match. Naturally, the island's position in the middle of the Tyrrhenian Sea and its proximity to the Italian and French coasts, paired with its size would prove it a useful port from which we could project our naval influence across the western Mediterranean. Corsica is, in fact, close enough to the Straits of Sicily and Gibraltar to allow us to control naval entry into the region. The island has always been a key token of Mediterranean geopolitics. During the Middle Ages, it was one of the only islands in the Mediterranean able to resist the Muslim invasions, being held by Genoa until revolting in a brief period of independence, whereupon it was annexed by France in May 1769, just in time for Napoleon to be born on French soil 3 months later.;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELEARESISLAND;\n\nThe Balearic Islands are an archipelago in the western Mediterranean Sea composed of 4 islands, namely Mallorca, Ibiza, Menorca and Formentera. Among the four islands, Mallorca, the largest by size, is also home to the majority of the archipelago's population. Being located so close to the French and Spanish coasts, the possession of these islands would be quite useful, as a navy projecting power from them would go a long way towards keeping both nations in check, whilst also granting us the ability to blockade or at least interdict the entrance to the Mediterranean. The archipelago fell to Muslim forces during the Middle Ages, only to be conquered by the Kingdom of Aragon, which owned the islands until its unification with Castile. They remained under Spanish control barring a brief British occupation of Menorca and a French invasion during the Napoleonic Wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOLAMAISLAND;\n\nLocated in the Atlantic Ocean to the west of the Geba and Grande de Buba river deltas, the Bijagós Islands are a group of about 88 islands and islets, of which twenty are permanently inhabited. The archipelago is nearly thirteen thousand square kilometers in size, and its economy is largely rural, with most families living from subsistence farming and fishing. The islands would make for a useful supply stop on the route along the West African coast, as is evidenced by the fact that Britain attempted to seize the most populated island, Bolama, in 1792 and 1814. The failed attempts to colonize the islands also demonstrate that there is a difficulty to be faced if we are to take control of them: Diseases like yellow fever, malaria and sleeping sickness are very dangerous to Europeans who are especially susceptible to them. They decimated several European settlements and forced Britain to abandon both of its attempts at colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
