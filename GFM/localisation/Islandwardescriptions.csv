ALANDISLANDS;\n\nThe Åland Islands are an archipelago located at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia. It comprises Fasta Åland, the largest island, on which 90% of the population resides, and about 6,500 skerries and islands to its east, of which less than a hundred are inhabited. The islands occupy a position of strategic importance, as they command one of the entrances to the port of Stockholm, as well as the approaches to the Gulf of Bothnia, in addition to being situated near the Gulf of Finland. The islands were part of the Kingdom of Sweden until they were transferred to the Tsardom of Russia in the 1807 Treaty of Fredrikshamn alongside all of Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTLANDISLAND;\n\nThe island of Gotland lies east of Sweden and is fully encompassed by the Baltic Sea. With a length of 125km, a width of 52km and a size of nearly three thousand square kilometers, its mainstay is not fishing but agriculture. The island was once covered in many marshes and bogs, but after Sweden took control over the island in the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, these were gradually drained to make way for farmland and pastures. Gotland commands a strategic position in the center of the Baltic Sea, and its largest city, Visby, possesses a large natural harbor that serves as an ideal naval base. The island also shows promise as a tourist destination: Socialites are increasingly visiting the island on holiday to go bathing at its many calm beaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OLANDISLAND;\n\nA description will be added soon. Sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BORNHOLMISLAND;\n\nStrategically located in the southern Baltic Sea, Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. It has usually been ruled by Denmark, but also by Sweden and by Lübeck. The ruin of Hammershus, at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest medieval fortress in northern Europe, testament to the importance of its location. The island is just under six hundred square kilometers in size, and its geology consists of granite, which is mined in numerous quarries. Bornholm's largest town, Rønne, is located at a natural harbor on its southeastern shore. It was fairly important during the Middle Ages, but has lost significance due to the general decline in Baltic trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUGENISLAND;\n\nLocated just off the coast of Hither Pomerania, Rügen is an island 52km wide and 41 km long, measuring nearly one thousand square kilometers in size. The 2km-wide Strelasund, a sound of the Baltic Sea, separates it from the mainland. It had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until its transfer to Sweden in the Peace of Westphalia after the 30 Years' War, returning to German hands with the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The island's beaches have been home to resorts since the 18th century, attracting increasing numbers of tourists. Rügen's many narrow peninsulas and seaside cliffs make it quite defensible. Its highest point, the 161m Piekberg, is crowned by the old Granitz hunting lodge, a residence of the local nobles, that has a tower from which the entire island and its surrounding waters can be observed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HELIGOLANDISLAND;\n\nHeligoland is a small archipelago in the North Sea located 46km off the coast of Germany.It consists of the namesake main island of Heligoland itself, where all of the inhabitants live, and the Düne, a small, desolate and uninhabited island to the east. Naturally, Heligoland's location offers a strategic but slightly exposed position in the North Sea, allowing it to be used as a launching point of hypothetical invasions of Germany, Scandinavia or even the Lowlands. Of course, some investments in infrastructure would need to be made. Heligoland was part of Denmark or Schleswig for most of its history, and was annexed by Great Britain during the Napoleonic Wars to prevent further French naval agression in the region. With Napoleon permanently subdued, the island became nothing more than a tourist destination and refuge for revolutionaries from Germany and Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WESTFRISIANISLANDS;\n\nThe West Frisian Islands, also known as the Dutch Wadden Islands, are a series of 14 small stable barrier islands off the Dutch coast. Of the 14, only 5 are currently inhabited, with some of the uninhabited ones disappearing from time to time. The archipelago would grant us total control over half of the Dutch coast, while also being a useful naval base for any operation in the North Sea. As with the rest of the Wadden Archipelago, the West Frisian Islands will need quite a lot of investment if we want to make the most out of them. Considering the importance of the Dutch in European trade, effectively taking control of their coast could prove very worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EASTFRISIANISLANDS;\n\nA part of the Wadden Archipelago, the East Frisian Islands are an island chain located about 3.5km to 10km off the coast of Germany. They are 12 islands in total, of which more than half are currently inhabited. It must be noted, however, that they are not entirely stable, with locals affirming that some of the islands are still subject to movement and change caused by the ever-present tides and frequent storms. By acquiring the East Frisian Islands we would not only gain a strong position controlling the western German coast, but also a useful port in the North Sea, which we could use as a base of operations for our navy. The islands have historically been somewhat insignificant, never catching the attention of the great powers. Some of them only became inhabited by the 13th century, with many being used as havens for smugglers and pirates from the Middle Ages all the way to the Napoleonic Wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NORTHFRISIANISLANDS;\n\nLocated to the west of the North Sea coast of Schleswig, the North Frisian Islands are a small archipelago in the Wadden Sea made up of somewhere between thirteen and twenty isles depending on who you ask. The largest islands, Sylt, Föhr and Amrum, have non-marine sediments that make them less vulnerable to erosion, while Pellworm and Nordstrand are reclaimed marshlands protected by dikes. The other dozen or so islets are the so-called Halligen, which are unprotected from the elements and frequently flooded. The North Frisian Islands differ from the other Wadden Islands in that they aren't barrier islands, making them less susceptible to storms and high tides. Due to these more favorable conditions, the North Frisian Island could be easily used as a safe harbor and base of operations for our navy in the North Sea. The islands were first settled by Frisians and Danes around the 8th century, remaining under Copenhagen's control for over a millennia, albeit with more autonomy after being incorporated into the Duchy of Schleswig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MALTAISLAND;\n\nThe Maltese islands are strategically located between Sicily and North Africa in the central Mediterranean Sea. They consist of an archipelago made up of 3 large inhabited islands, namely Malta, Gozo and Comino, and numerous smaller outlying islets and skerries. Malta's strategic importance is immediately apparent, and controlling it would grant us an excellent naval base in the middle of the Mediterranean. Its central location paired with its size and defensibility would make it a valuable asset, especially considering the extensive port infrastructure and fortifications already built by the British, who took control of the islands in 1800. The archipelago's tumultuous history speaks to its significance and value: Over the centuries, Malta was controlled intermittently by the Byzantines, the Arabs, the Normans, Sicily, Spain, the Knights Hospitaller and Napoleonic France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELBAISLAND;\n\nElba is the largest island of the Tuscan Archipelago, which also includes six smaller inhabited islands and a number of rocks and skerries. Seizing Elba, located just 10km from the coast of Tuscany and about 50km from the coast of Corsica, would grant us great influence over the Tyrrhenian Sea. The island also possesses significant iron ore deposits that were already exploited in the pre-Roman era. Taking control of one of Italy's only domestic sources of iron would create greater reliance on foreign imports for steel production. Due to its strategic position and its inexhaustible mineral wealth, Elba has for millennia been coveted by the greatest powers of the Mediterranean. Control over the island was once disputed between the merchant republics of Italy, passing between Genoa, Pisa, Pombino and Tuscany, with Naples and Spain also staking claims of their own. In 1814, Elba became seat of Napoleon's first exile, before finally being given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany after the Congress of Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FERNANDOPOISLAND;\n\nThe island of Fernando Po, also known as Bioko, is located approximately 32km from the coast of Africa in the Bight of Benin. At just over two thousand square kilometers, it is of relatively reasonable size, having a length of 70km and a width of 32km. While Bioko may not have a central position in the Atlantic like Saint Helena or Ascension, the island is nonetheless well positioned in the middle of the Bight of Benin, thus allowing our navy to exert influence over valuable areas of the West African coast. Navigator Fernão do Pó first spotted the island in 1472 and named it after himself, claiming it for Portugal, which lead to the creation of sugar plantations with an output so massive that they briefly dominated European markets. Portugal ceded the island to Spain under the 1778 Treaty of El Pardo, whereupon Spain leased the island to Britain in 1827 as an outpost for combatting the slave trade, proving the its utility as a naval base.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAOTOMEISLAND;\n\nThe islands of São Tomé and Príncipe are part of a volcano chain, the Cameroon Line, featuring striking rock and coral formations, rainforests and beaches. Both islands are surrounded by a total of six uninhabited islets too small to support economically gainful development. São Tomé, which is home to the most population, is located about 150km southwest of Principé. Their location at the Gulf of Guinea would provide a strong position on the coast of Africa, although conditions on the islands may prove a challenge to the construction of proper naval infrastructure. Under our control, they could become a pivotal naval asset to our growing empire. After being discovered by the Portuguese in 1470, the islands were first settled in 1493, leading to the establishment of numerous sugarcane plantations, forming the lucrative backbone of their economies to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FERNANDOISLAND;\n\nFernando de Noronha is the name of an archipelago consisting of 21 islands located 350km from the coast of Brazil. The islands were first discovered by Portuguese merchant Fernão de Loronha in 1503. In the centuries thereafter, brief occupations by the Germans, English, Dutch and French occurred, before the archipelago was finally retaken by the Portuguese in 1739. In recent times, Fernando de Noronha has been visited by a number of British scientific expeditions. It has also begun to be used as a penal colony. After the explusion of the convicts, the archipelago could be converted into a useful naval base to expand our influence in South America, thus extending the range of our navy in the South Atlantic and enabling us to definitively assert our position in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRINDADEISLAND;\n\nThe Trindade and Martim Vaz Archipelago is known as the most remote part of Brazil. It is located around 1025km from the mainland in the southern Atlantic Ocean and is only ten square kilometers in size. Consisting of five islands, as well as several rocks and stacks, the archipelago is extremely desolate and of volcanic origin. First discovered by Portuguese explorer Estêvão da Gama in 1502, the islands remained at least nominally Portuguese until Brazilian independence in 1822. There were attempts by Britain to take the islands in 1700 and 1781, demonstrating their strategic value. Significant investment would certainly be required to construct a naval base of significant capacity. As the archipelago is located far from the Brazilian coast, it would grant us the ability to interdict naval traffic in the South Atlantic and along the Brazilian coastline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHILOEISLAND;\n\nChiloé is the largest island of the eponymous Chiloé Archipelago. It is 190km long, 65km wide and more than eight thousand square kilometers in size. Most of the island's settlements are located on the less remote eastern and northern shores, where the minimum distance from the Chilean mainland is only 2.5km at the Chacao Channel. Although Chiloé has been inhabited by the Chono and Huilliche peoples for millenia, Spain established its first settlement in 1567 with the founding of the city of Castro. Although Chile declared independence in 1813, Chiloé remained a royalist holdout until it was finally wrested from Madrid's control in 1826. In recent years, the island has gained importance as a port of call for whaling vessels. Chiloé would make for an excellent naval base, as its separation from the mainland and its remote location make it easy to hold, while also giving our navy a powerful position in the South Pacific, the Strait of Magellan and the western coast of South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EASTERISLAND;\n\nThought to be one of the most isolated places in the world, Easter Island, also known by its native polynesian name of Rapa Nui, is located around away 2015km from the closest human settlement, in the Pitcairn island. The island was visited by Europeans many times, with some unfortunate raids by Peruvian slavers that let loose an smallpox epidemic on the island. With the arrival of missionaries in the island found itself suffering this time with a tuberculosis epidemic, that left less than a thousand natives remaining. After that, the island would fall under British, French and even German interest, before being sold to the Chielan goverment. Despite the island's remote position in the Pacific Ocean, it would empower us to operate on the Polynesian region if we were to invest on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GALAPAGOSISLANDS;\n\nThe Galapagos Islands are a volcanic archipelago separated from the mainland of South America by 900km of the Eastern Pacific. In total, the group consists of 127 islands, rocks and islets that have a total area of just over eight thousand square kilometers. They were first discovered in 1535, when the bishop of Panama, Fray Tomás de Berlanga, was blown off course on the way to Peru. In the centuries thereafter, the arid and barren archipelago was left uninhabited, though pirates and whalers made use of it from time to time. With permanent settlement establishing itself in the 1830s, the islands have garnered increasing attention from naval powers, as they make for an excellent naval base that projects power both towards the isthmus of Panama and to the western coast of South America as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAVASSAISLAND;\n\nLocated 55km away from the westernmost point of Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, Navassa Island is a small limestone islet little more than five square kilometers in size. Though it was discovered by Colombus' fourth voyage in 1504, Navassa was not settled until this century, as is it is too small and desolate to support a population. In recent years, however, the island has garnered increased attention, as it is known to be inhabited by large seabird colonies, which have produced large deposits of valuable guano, a highly effective fertilizer. The island is not of any strategic value, as it offers no ports or harbors, meaning that all ships must anchor offshore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SANANDRESISLAND;\n\nThe archipelago of San Andrés and Providencia consists of two island groups and eight outlying banks and reefs in the Caribbean Sea about 190km east of the Mosquito Coast. Spain first claimed the islands in 1540, though it would take several centuries for them to be settled. They were initially administered by the Captaincy General of Guatemala, then transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1803, leading to a long-standing dispute that continues to this day. The islanders' main occupations are fishing and agriculture, which is surprisingly diverse. Crops include coconuts, cotton, corn, avocados, sugarcane, mangos, oranges, yams, noni, cassava, papayas, sweet potatoes, pineapples, beans and tobacco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARGARITAISLAND;\n\nMargarita Island is situated off the northeastern coast of Venezuela. It is just over one thousand square kilometers in size, and of volcanic geology. In the 21km strait separating it from the South American continent, there lie another two smaller isles, Cubagua and Coche. The local economy consists of fishing, agriculture and the keeping of livestock. It is blessed with generous fresh water, bountiful soils and plentiful shoals. Columbus came across Margarita Island in 1498, and the first Spanish settlement was established in 1529. Besides brief occupations by rogue conquistadors and pirates, the island remained Spanish until the collapse of the Spanish colonial empire in 1810.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAINTPIERREISLAND;\n\nThe archipelago of Saint Pierre and Miquelon is made up of 8 islands, of which the the two largest give it its name. The islands, amounting to just under two hundred and fifty square kilometers in size, are bare and rocky, with steep coasts, and only a thin layer of peat to soften the hard landscape. Portuguese explorer João Fagundes was the first European to land on the archipelago in 1520. Permanent settlement on the largest islands, St Pierre and Miquelon, was established by French fishermen in the mid-17th century. France retained the islands as their only North American possession at the end of the 7 Years' War. The British expelled all settlers during the American and French Revolutions as well as the Napoleonic Wars, leaving the islands desolate, though they have since been resettled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QUEENCHARLOTTEISLANDS;\n\nThe Queen Charlotte Islands are located 55-125km west of British Columbia, separated from it by the shallow Hecate Strait. To the north and south, the Dixon Entrance and Queen Charlotte Sound respectively lie between the islands and the Alexander Archipelago as well as Vancouver Island. The Queen Charlotte Islands consist of two main isles: Graham Island in the north and Moresby Island in the south, along with approximately 400 smaller islands with a total landmass of over ten thousand square kilometers. At present, the main economic activities are fishing and logging, but output remains meager due to low population density and the near-total lack of infrastructure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANTACATALINAISLANDS;\n\nA description will be added soon. Sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCILLYISLANDS;\n\nForty kilometers to the west of Land's End, the westernmost point of Cornwall, there is a small archipelago named the Isles of Scilly. Made up of 145 islands and rocky islets, they only measure sixteen square kilometers in size. The majority of inhabitants live on one island, St Mary's, of which close to half live in the largest settlement, Hugh Town. The remainder live on the four inhabited 'off-islands', namely Tresco, St Martin's, St Agnes, and Bryher. The locals rely on trade with the mainland to sustain themselves, working variously in kelp harvesting, pilotage, smuggling, fishing and shipbuilding. The islands have served as a place of exile many times throughout history, from the Roman period to the English Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHANNELISLANDS;\n\nA description will be added soon. Sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISLEOFMAN;\n\nBetween Great Britain and Ireland, in the center of the Irish Sea, there lies an island known as the Isle of Man. It is almost six hundred square kilometers in size, measuring 53km in length and 21km in width. It has experienced many centuries of English rule, having been taken from the Scottish in 1346. The isle's economic mainstays are fishing and agriculture, though it is also home to a small mining industry. The Foxdale Mines, opened in 1724, are the most productive zinc mines in the entirety of the British Isles. The Manx people speak their own language, which is mutually intelligible with Irish and Scots Gaelic, though it has been on the decline for centuries in favor of English.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHETLANDISLANDS;\n\nAbout 170km northeast of Scotland there is an archipelago called the Shetland Islands. It has an oceanic climate, complex geology, rugged coastline, and many low, rolling hills. In all, the Shetlands are made up of about 300 islands and skerries, amounting to an area of nearly one thousand five hundred square kilometers, a thousand of which belong to the largest island, ironically named 'the Mainland'. The archipelago fell under Scottish rule in 1469, when it was ceded by the Kingdom of Norway. Shetlanders are known to have impressive nautical skill, as they have centuries of experience in fishing. Many have made a name for themselves by putting their expertise to use in the Royal Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISLEOFWIGHT;\n\nSeparated from Hampshire by the Solent, a strait 4-8km in width, the Isle of Wight is England's largest island at nearly four hundred square kilometers. It has played an essential part in the defence of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth and has been near the front line of conflicts through the ages, having faced the Spanish Armada. Though the island was last invaded by the French in 1545, the British government has built many fortifications on it over the centuries, hoping to defend against any possible future landings. The Isle of Wight is mostly rural, with most people employed in farming, fishing, or boat-building, although a small tourist sector has formed of late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONGISLAND;\n\nWith a land area of a little over three thousand six hundred square kilometers, Long Island is the largest island in the contiguous United States. It extends 190km eastward into the ocean from New York Harbor with a maximum northsouth width 37 km. It also possesses a ring of barrier islands that extend for 75km along its south shore, known as the Outer Barrier. Long Island was first settled by Europeans in 1640, when the town of Southold was established by the Rev. John Youngs from Connecticut. Most of the population is currently concentrated on its western end, close to the island of Manhattan. The rest of the island is rural and primarily devoted to agriculture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CORSICAISLAND;\n\nLocated around 90km from Tuscany, the Island of Corsica has long been inhabited, being the Mediterranean's 4th largest island, with a sizeable population to match. Naturally, the island's position in the middle of the Tyrrhenian Sea and its proximity to the Italian and French coast, paired with its size would prove it an useful port to project our naval influence all through the Western Mediterranean, being close enough to the Straits of Sicily and Gibraltar to allow us to control naval entry into the region. The Island of Corsica has long been a piece of Mediterranean geopolitics, but during the Middle ages, it was one of the few islands in the Mediterranean that resisted Muslim invasion, being held by Genoa until revolting in a brief period of independence and being annexed by France in May, 1769,  just in time for Napoleon being born in the island under French soil 3 months later.;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELEARESISLAND;\n\nThe Balearic Islands are an archipelago in the western Mediterranean Sea, composed of 4 islands, Mallorca, Ibiza, Menorca and Formentera, of which Mallorca alone holds most of the population. Being located so close to the French and Spanish coasts, these islands would be pretty useful to keep both nations in check, while also granting us a naval base from which we could blockade the entrance to the Mediterranean. The archipelago fell to Muslim forces during the Middle Ages,  only to be conquered by The Kingdom of Aragon, whom owned the islands until its unification with Castile, not changing owners until a brief British occupation of Menorca and the French invasion during the Napoleonic Wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
