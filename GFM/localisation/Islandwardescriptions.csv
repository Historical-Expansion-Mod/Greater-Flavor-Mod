ALANDISLANDS;The Åland Islands are an archipelago located at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia. It comprises Fasta Åland, the largest island, on which 90% of the population resides, and about 6,500 skerries and islands to its east, of which less than a hundred are inhabited. The islands occupy a position of strategic importance, as they command one of the entrances to the port of Stockholm, as well as the approaches to the Gulf of Bothnia, in addition to being situated near the Gulf of Finland. The islands were part of the Kingdom of Sweden until they were transferred to the Tsardom of Russia in the 1807 Treaty of Fredrikshamn alongside all of Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTLANDISLAND;The island of Gotland lies east of Sweden and is fully encompassed by the Baltic Sea. With a length of 125km, a width of 52km and a size of nearly three thousand square kilometers, its mainstay is not fishing but agriculture. The island was once covered in many marshes and bogs, but after Sweden took control over the island in the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, these were gradually drained to make way for farmland and pastures. Gotland commands a strategic position in the center of the Baltic Sea, and its largest city, Visby, possesses a large natural harbor that serves as an ideal naval base. The island also shows promise as a tourist destination: Socialites are increasingly visiting the island on holiday to go bathing at its many calm beaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BORNHOLMISLAND;Strategically located in the southern Baltic Sea, Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. It has usually been ruled by Denmark, but also by Sweden and by Lübeck. The ruin of Hammershus, at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest medieval fortress in northern Europe, testament to the importance of its location. The island is just under six hundred square kilometers in size, and its geology consists of granite, which is mined in numerous quarries. Bornholm's largest town, Rønne, is located at a natural harbor on its southeastern shore. It was fairly important during the Middle Ages, but has lost significance due to the general decline in Baltic trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUGENISLAND;Located just off the coast of Hither Pomerania, Rügen is an island 52km wide and 41 km long, measuring nearly one thousand square kilometers in size. The 2km-wide Strelasund, a sound of the Baltic Sea, separates it from the mainland. It had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until its transfer to Sweden in the Peace of Westphalia after the 30 Years' War, returning to German hands with the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The island's beaches have been home to resorts since the 18th century, attracting increasing numbers of tourists. Rügen's many narrow peninsulas and seaside cliffs make it quite defensible. Its highest point, the 161m Piekberg, is crowned by the old Granitz hunting lodge, a residence of the local nobles, that has a tower from which the entire island and its surrounding waters can be observed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SHETLANDISLANDS;About 170km northeast of Scotland there is an archipelago called the Shetland Islands. It has an oceanic climate, complex geology, rugged coastline, and many low, rolling hills. In all, the Shetlands are made up of about 300 islands and skerries, amounting to an area of nearly one thousand five hundred square kilometers, a thousand of which belong to the largest island, ironically named 'the Mainland'. The archipelago fell under Scottish rule in 1469, when it was ceded by the Kingdom of Norway. Shetlanders are known to have impressive nautical skill, as they have centuries of experience in fishing. Many have made a name for themselves by putting their expertise to use in the Royal Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISLEOFWIGHT;Separated from Hampshire by the Solent, a strait 4-8km in width, the Isle of Wight is England's largest island at nearly four hundred square kilometers. It has played an essential part in the defence of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth and has been near the front line of conflicts through the ages, having faced the Spanish Armada. Though the island was last invaded by the French in 1545, the British government has built many fortifications on it over the centuries, hoping to defend against any possible future landings. The Isle of Wight is mostly rural, with most people employed in farming, fishing, or boat-building, although a small tourist sector has formed of late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
