ALANDISLANDS;The Åland Islands are an archipelago located at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia. It comprises Fasta Åland, the largest island, on which 90% of the population resides, and about 6,500 skerries and islands to its east, of which less than a hundred are inhabited. The islands occupy a position of strategic importance, as they command one of the entrances to the port of Stockholm, as well as the approaches to the Gulf of Bothnia, in addition to being situated near the Gulf of Finland. The islands were part of the Kingdom of Sweden until they were transferred to the Tsardom of Russia in the 1807 Treaty of Fredrikshamn alongside all of Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTLANDISLAND;The island of Gotland lies east of Sweden and is fully encompassed by the Baltic Sea. With a length of 125km, a width of 52km and a size of nearly three thousand square kilometers, its mainstay is not fishing but agriculture. The island was once covered in many marshes and bogs, but after Sweden took control over the island in the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, these were gradually drained to make way for farmland and pastures. Gotland commands a strategic position in the center of the Baltic Sea, and its largest city, Visby, possesses a large natural harbor that serves as an ideal naval base. The island also shows promise as a tourist destination: Socialites are increasingly visiting the island on holiday to go bathing at its many calm beaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BORNHOLMISLAND;Strategically located in the southern Baltic Sea, Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. It has usually been ruled by Denmark, but also by Sweden and by Lübeck. The ruin of Hammershus, at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest medieval fortress in northern Europe, testament to the importance of its location. The island is just under six hundred square kilometers in size, and its geology consists of granite, which is mined in numerous quarries. Bornholm's largest town, Rønne, is located at a natural harbor on its southeastern shore. It was fairly important during the Middle Ages, but has lost significance due to the general decline in Baltic trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUGENISLAND;Located just off the coast of Hither Pomerania, Rügen is an island 52km wide and 41 km long, measuring nearly one thousand square kilometers in size. The 2km-wide Strelasund, a sound of the Baltic Sea, separates it from the mainland. It had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until its transfer to Sweden in the Peace of Westphalia after the 30 Years' War, returning to German hands with the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The island's beaches have been home to resorts since the 18th century, attracting increasing numbers of tourists. Rügen's many narrow peninsulas and seaside cliffs make it quite defensible. Its highest point, the 161m Piekberg, is crowned by the old Granitz hunting lodge, a residence of the local nobles, that has a tower from which the entire island and its surrounding waters can be observed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GALAPAGOSISLANDS;The Galapagos Islands are a volcanic archipelago separated from the mainland of South America by 900km of the Eastern Pacific. In total, the group consists of 127 islands, rocks and islets that have a total area of just over eight thousand square kilometers. They were first discovered in 1535, when the bishop of Panama, Fray Tomás de Berlanga, was blown off course on the way to Peru. In the centuries thereafter, the arid and barren archipelago was left uninhabited, though pirates and whalers made use of it from time to time. With permanent settlement establishing itself in the 1830s, the islands have garnered increasing attention from naval powers, as they make for an excellent naval base that projects power both towards the isthmus of Panama and to the western coast of South America as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAVASSAISLAND;Located 55km away from the westernmost point of Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, Navassa Island is a small limestone islet little more than five square kilometers in size. Though it was discovered by Colombus' fourth voyage in 1504, Navassa was not settled until this century, as is it is too small and desolate to support a population. In recent years, however, the island has garnered increased attention, as it is known to be inhabited by large seabird colonies, which have produced large deposits of valuable guano, a highly effective fertilizer. The island is not of any strategic value, as it offers no ports or harbors, meaning that all ships must anchor offshore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SAINTPIERREISLAND;The archipelago of Saint Pierre and Miquelon is made up of 8 islands, of which the the two largest give it its name. The islands, amounting to just under two hundred and fifty square kilometers in size, are bare and rocky, with steep coasts, and only a thin layer of peat to soften the hard landscape. Portuguese explorer João Fagundes was the first European to land on the archipelago in 1520. Permanent settlement on the largest islands, St Pierre and Miquelon, was established by French fishermen in the mid-17th century. France retained the islands as their only North American possession at the end of the 7 Years' War. The British expelled all settlers during the American and French Revolutions as well as the Napoleonic Wars, leaving the islands desolate, though they have since been resettled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QUEENCHARLOTTEISLANDS;The Queen Charlotte Islands are located 55-125km west of British Columbia, separated from it by the shallow Hecate Strait. To the north and south, the Dixon Entrance and Queen Charlotte Sound respectively lie between the islands and the Alexander Archipelago as well as Vancouver Island. The Queen Charlotte Islands consist of two main isles: Graham Island in the north and Moresby Island in the south, along with approximately 400 smaller islands with a total landmass of over ten thousand square kilometers. At present, the main economic activities are fishing and logging, but output remains meager due to low population density and the near-total lack of infrastructure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SCILLYISLANDS;Forty kilometers to the west of Land's End, the westernmost point of Cornwall, there is a small archipelago named the Isles of Scilly. Made up of 145 islands and rocky islets, they only measure sixteen square kilometers in size. The majority of inhabitants live on one island, St Mary's, of which close to half live in the largest settlement, Hugh Town. The remainder live on the four inhabited 'off-islands', namely Tresco, St Martin's, St Agnes, and Bryher. The locals rely on trade with the mainland to sustain themselves, working variously in kelp harvesting, pilotage, smuggling, fishing and shipbuilding. The islands have served as a place of exile many times throughout history, from the Roman period to the English Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ISLEOFMAN;Between Great Britain and Ireland, in the center of the Irish Sea, there lies an island known as the Isle of Man. It is almost six hundred square kilometers in size, measuring 53km in length and 21km in width. It has experienced many centuries of English rule, having been taken from the Scottish in 1346. The isle's economic mainstays are fishing and agriculture, though it is also home to a small mining industry. The Foxdale Mines, opened in 1724, are the most productive zinc mines in the entirety of the British Isles. The Manx people speak their own language, which is mutually intelligible with Irish and Scots Gaelic, though it has been on the decline for centuries in favor of English.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHETLANDISLANDS;About 170km northeast of Scotland there is an archipelago called the Shetland Islands. It has an oceanic climate, complex geology, rugged coastline, and many low, rolling hills. In all, the Shetlands are made up of about 300 islands and skerries, amounting to an area of nearly one thousand five hundred square kilometers, a thousand of which belong to the largest island, ironically named 'the Mainland'. The archipelago fell under Scottish rule in 1469, when it was ceded by the Kingdom of Norway. Shetlanders are known to have impressive nautical skill, as they have centuries of experience in fishing. Many have made a name for themselves by putting their expertise to use in the Royal Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISLEOFWIGHT;Separated from Hampshire by the Solent, a strait 4-8km in width, the Isle of Wight is England's largest island at nearly four hundred square kilometers. It has played an essential part in the defence of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth and has been near the front line of conflicts through the ages, having faced the Spanish Armada. Though the island was last invaded by the French in 1545, the British government has built many fortifications on it over the centuries, hoping to defend against any possible future landings. The Isle of Wight is mostly rural, with most people employed in farming, fishing, or boat-building, although a small tourist sector has formed of late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONGISLAND;With a land area of a little over three thousand six hundred square kilometers, Long Island is the largest island in the contiguous United States. It extends 190km eastward into the ocean from New York Harbor with a maximum northsouth width 37 km. It also possesses a ring of barrier islands that extend for 75km along its south shore, known as the Outer Barrier. Long Island was first settled by Europeans in 1640, when 1640, when the town of Southold was established by the Rev. John Youngs from Connecticut. Most of the population is currently concentrated on its western end, close to the island of Manhattan. The rest of the island is rural and primarily devoted to agriculture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
