EVTDESC72758;\n\nThe Austrians have recently been drawing lines in Italy, and have with no justification or legal claim included Corsica in the domain of Sardinia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72757;\n\nIt would seem that our supervision was not as strict as planned. During the redrawing of Italian borders, the finalized map of the new Italian vassals included the island of Corsica within the territorial bounders of Sardinia. While this detail went unnoticed by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials, it has grabbed the attention of the French. Infuriated, France has demanded an immediate explanation followed by an apology from $COUNTRY$ over the actions of their vassal. Some believe that $COUNTRY$ should apologize and scold Sardinia. The island's stupidity may very well lead to war. Others believe Vienna should stand by its vassals no matter the circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC72754;Although $COUNTRY$ has tried to control the Italian peninsula through the creation of Lombardy, Sicily, and the Papal rump state, the fires of Italian nationalism continue to burn. Many in Vienna are of the opinion that an unified Italy is impossible to avoid, and it is best that the Italian state be created peacefully through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ guidance rather through a bloody revolution. Others argued that a unified Italy will quickly grow out of our control. Either way a decision must be reached on what to do with Italy. The question then arises who shall rule the Italy. Should it be Lombardy in the north? Perhaps the legacy of Austrian rule in Milan will result in a loyal and capable subject? On the other hand, the rulers of Sicily were once of Habsburg blood, and it could be wise to keep things in the family. There are some who say the crown should to neither the Lombards nor the Sicilians, but rather the Holy Father himself in Rome. And of course there are those boring old sods who want to keep the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC72751;At the expense of most of their colonial possessions, the Iberian Peninsula is under firm $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. While the most obvious choice is to have Iberia ruled by the Spanish majority and governed in the centrally located city of Madrid, there are arguments to be made in favor of the peninsula's other nationalities. In contrast to Spanish who were facing revolts both Carlist and colonialist alike, Portugal has experienced relative stability. Perhaps they would be better fit to administer Iberia? On the other side of the peninsula are the Catalans. The best way to quell their nationalistic tendencies might to give them a nation look after. There are some who argue that to exert control, the ruling elite must be kept to small minority and have therefore recommended the Basque. One more thing to note, is a letter has recently been received petitioning for the Galicians although this might be some sort of practical joke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72750;The Scandinavian people of the north are so culturally similar, it only makes sense that they should be organized into one state. A state, of course, looked after by $COUNTRY$. The question arises where the new capital of this union should be, and in in what language the capital should expect to receive reports. As of right now, the current consensus is place administrative duties in the hands of the Danes as they were the original rulers of the Kalmar Union of old. However, Copenhagen is surrounded by the sea and could therefore be vulnerable to nearby naval powers. Stockholm would make a fine capital, and the Swedes once had dominion over the Baltics. Perhaps their time should come again, but with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ supervision. The Norwegians have a history of being subservient, first under the Danes then more recently under the Swedes. Perhaps there is no one better to rule a puppet state than former vassal? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With a recent cooling in relations between France and Germany, the doves in $CAPITAL$ have proposed border negotiations with France and even suggests seceding Metz. A border treaty would not be popular with the Prussian elements of society, but it might be necessary to preserve peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6542984;For quite some time, there has been a cooling of relations between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$, and in a surprising turn of events, the Germans have requested to negotiate over the hotly contested land of Alsace-Lorraine. In return for recognizing German rule over the provinces of Colmar and Strasbourg, they are willing to return Metz back to French control. Some say this treaty will finally bring peace to the west, others say it would be a stab in the back of the people of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7184127;France has refused to negotiate and will not compromise for the sake of peace. The recent diplomatic progress has been squandered, and war is once again the status quo.

Now, it has been proposed that Turkish general Fahrettin Altay, who has declared himself willing, be the arbitrator. To begin the process, he first needs the approval of our and the Iranian government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALTAYARBITRATIONPER;\n\nWe have, for many decades, been at odds with our neighbors, the Afghans, over the border region of Lash Wa Juwayn. While the British-led Goldsmid Arbitration delineated much of our shared boundary, it failed to clearly demarcate this contested area. We are in agreement with the Afghans that the British should not lead yet another arbitration and that a new, neutral party must be sought. Now, it has been proposed that Turkish general Fahrettin Altay, who has declared himself willing, be the arbitrator. The Afghan government has already given him their approval. Perhaps now is the time to put an end to our dispute?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALTAYARBITRATIONTUR;\n\nIran and Afghanistan have approached us, requesting that General Fahrettin Altay be the arbitrator over their dispute concerning the contested Lash Wa Juwayn region that the British Goldsmid Arbitration failed to clearly demarcate. We must now decide to whom we award the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

tondenhei_title;Recruit Tondenhei to Settle in Hokkaido;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tondenhei_desc;To strengthen our presence in the frontier territory of Hokkaido, we need more settlers there. To that end, we can recruit ex-samurai and their families to move to Hokkaido, allocating a six-acre plot to each family. There's added benefit also in specifically recruiting ex-samurai, since they make ideal reservists to call up at a moment's notice. They can be charged with keeping the peace in case of ethnic tension with Hokkaido's indigenous Ainu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
