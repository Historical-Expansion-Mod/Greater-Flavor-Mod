russo_japanese_war_title;Ambush the Russian Fleet at Port Arthur;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_desc;Tension between Japan and Russia has simmered for years as both nations struggle to secure dominance in Korea and northern China. That rivalry can no longer remain peaceful. Only victory over Russia will allow us to become the true masters of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_japanese_treaty_title;A Treaty with Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_japanese_treaty_desc;Russia’s crushing defeat has given us the leverage to impose harsh terms. It is time to decide which territories we will claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_russian_treaty_title;A Treaty with Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russo_japanese_war_russian_treaty_desc;Japan struck without warning, and now must face the consequences of defeat and humiliation. We now have the chance to negotiate exactly what territory we will take from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784518;Japan Ambushes the Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784518;\n\nDiplomatic tension with Japan has grown steadily as both our nations compete for dominance in East Asia. Now that tension has finally reached its breaking point. We have received word that the Japanese navy has launched a surprise attack on our Pacific Fleet, docked at Port Arthur. They intend this to be the opening move in a decisive war for control of the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784519;We Are Winning Against Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784519;\n\nPort Arthur is occupied and momentum is firmly on our side. Russian troops struggle across the harsh Siberian expanses, making them easy targets for our entrenched forces. Their defeat appears close. Perhaps they would be more amenable to peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784520;Japan Offers Us Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784520;\n\nOur armies are exhausted, and Japan clearly holds the advantage. They have chosen this moment to propose peace. Their demands include Port Arthur and any portions of Sakhalin and the Kurils under our control. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784521;Russia Accepts Our Peace Offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784521;\n\nThe war has ended. Russia has accepted our generous peace terms, and our new territorial gains take effect immediately. This is a great day for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784522;Russia Rejects Our Peace Offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784522;\n\nDespite our advantage, Russia refuses to yield. They must be persuaded further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784523;We Are Winning Against Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784523;\n\nJapan’s surprise attack failed to secure lasting gains, and their offensive has stalled. Surely they are now realizing the futility of fighting on. Perhaps we should offer peace now and save them the bother of sending any more of their troops to their end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784524;Russia Offers Us Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784524;\n\nOur advance has collapsed after the opening attack, and victory now seems unlikely. Russia has therefore offered peace. Their terms demand our holdings in Sakhalin and the Kurils, as well as our diplomatic and military withdrawal from Korea. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784525;Japan Accepts Our Peace Offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784525;\n\nJapan has grown weary of this grinding conflict and has agreed to cede its portion of Sakhalin to us. It is unlikely they will challenge our position in the Far East again anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784526;Japan Refuses Our Peace Offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784526;\n\nJapan stubbornly clings to the hope of reversing the war’s course. How much more blood must be shed before they acknowledge reality?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784527;A Harsher Treaty with Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784527;\n\nWe now possess enough leverage to demand more territory than originally expected. Whatever lands we decide to annex from them will badly damage Russia’s position in East Asia and the Pacific. What territory shall we demand? (Note:  Russia does not own will cede no territory to you while still generating infamy.);;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784528;Japan Makes Its Peace Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784528;\n\nJapan demands all of Sakhalin, the Kurils, Outer Manchuria, and any of our East Asian territories. With the war over, we are obliged to cede this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7845281;\n\nJapan demands South Sakhalin, the Kurils, and any of our East Asian territories. With the war over, we are obliged to cede this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784529;Japan Makes a Harsh Peace Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784529;\n\nJapan demands all of our Far Eastern territory up to Kamchatka, along with any East Asian holdings. This would remove us entirely from the Pacific coast. Nevertheless, we are compelled to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784530;Japan’s Bold Peace Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784530;\n\nJapan demands the entirety of the Russian Far East up to Trans-Baikal, along with any East Asian territories. Virtually all of eastern Siberia would fall under Japanese control. It is a severe price for a defeated nation like ours to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784531;A Harsher Treaty with Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784531;\n\nWe now hold enough leverage to demand far more than expected. Whatever we choose will cripple Japan’s strategic position in East Asia and greatly hinder any future expansion. What shall we demand? (Note: Demanding land Japan does not own will cede no territory to you while still generating infamy.);;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784532;Russia Makes Its Peace Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784532;\n\nRussia demands Sakhalin, Hokkaido, and Tsushima, seeking to block any Japanese ambitions on the Asian mainland. We are, of course, obliged to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784533;Russia Makes a Harsh Peace Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784533;\n\nRussia demands Sakhalin, Hokkaido, Tsushima, and Taiwan, attempting to end any possibility of Japanese expansion into continental Asia. We are, of course, obliged to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME784534;Russia’s Bold Peace Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC784534;\n\nRussia demands Sakhalin, Hokkaido, Tsushima, and all Japanese-controlled Korean and Chinese territories. This would strip us of any influence on the mainland and leave our islands increasingly isolated. Whether we like it or not, we have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
aggression_against_russia;Aggression Against Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
aggression_against_russia_desc;We are waging an offensive war to drive Russia out of East Asia and the Pacific. This modifier expires 580 days after the Russo-Japanese War begins. If we capture and hold Port Arthur for at least 30 days by then, we may sue for peace. If not, Russia will be able to impose demands on us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expel_russians_from_far_east_title;Expel the Russians from the Far East;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expel_russians_from_far_east_desc;The Far East has taken on a distinctly Russian character after centuries of settlement. Though the population remains sparse, even a small rebellion is unacceptable. The Russian inhabitants must be expelled and replaced with Japanese settlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME666606;Russians Expelled from the Far East;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC666606;\n\nThe Japanese Far East is now almost entirely emptied of Russian inhabitants, leaving behind barren settlements and little trace of human life. From Irkutsk to Kamchatka, Russian citizens were rounded up and escorted toward Russian territory—at least in theory. In practice, many who resisted were killed, and only skilled workers were spared, who were promptly consigned to labor camps. Meanwhile, Yakutsk, Nizheudinsk, and Kansk overflow with refugees. They die by the scores: Siberia cannot feed them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME666607;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Forces Fail to Expel Russians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC666607;\n\nRussian inhabitants in the Far East have quickly mounted armed resistance and so far have largely thwarted our efforts at mass expulsion. Skirmishes between our soldiers and embattled civilians have been frequent, with Russian subjects crossing the border to lend support. The violence has also meant casualties for Japanese settlers, whom the Russian population has targeted in retaliatory killings.\n\nShould we continue with expulsion, it will have to be done piecemeal, avoiding face-on confrontation with armed resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME666608;We Shall Grant Military Access to Japan and Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC666608;\n\nThis would be the historically accurate decision. We will follow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME666609;You Canceled Our Military Access;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC666609;\n\nThat was not appreciated. Restore it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME666610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Grants Us Military Access;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC666610;\n\nSince we are contesting control of Korea and northern China, it is only natural that $FROMCOUNTRY$ grants us military access during this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
remove_jap_and_rus_military_access_title;Cancel Japanese and Russian Military Access;;;;;;;;;;;;;
remove_jap_and_rus_military_access_desc;The Russo-Japanese War has ended. Russian and Japanese forces must now return to their own borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME666611;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Cancels Our Military Access;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC666611;\n\nThe war has ended, and our forces must now depart. Our military access in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been revoked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invade_manchuria_title;Invade Manchuria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invade_manchuria_desc;China has always been a coveted objective for powers with the strength to seize it. Manchuria, in the northeast, is vast and resource-rich, and our recent Far Eastern gains make an invasion of it far easier. (This begins a war to disarm whichever Chinese-cultured state controlling Manchuria. After victory, a decision will appear allowing annexation of Manchuria.);;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_manchuria_title;Annex Manchuria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_manchuria_desc;Our Manchurian campaign has succeeded. Annexation can now begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
