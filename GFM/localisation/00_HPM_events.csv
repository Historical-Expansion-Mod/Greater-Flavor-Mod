EVTDESC199073;\n\nWith his servant Wang walking five paces ahead to announce his arrival, Robert Fortune, dressed in his mandarin garb, entered the gates of a green tea factory. Wang began to supplicate frantically. Would the master of the factory allow an inspection from a visitor, an honored and wise official who had traveled from a far province to see how such glorious tea was made? In 1848, the British East India Company sent Robert Fortune on a trip to China's interior, an area forbidden to foreigners. Fortune's mission was to steal the secrets of tea horticulture and manufacturing. The Scotsman donned a disguise and headed into the Wu Si Shan hills in a bold act of corporate espionage. The results can be seen today in $PROVINCE$, where the first tea plantations are yielding their first harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is for a high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ delivered an impassionate speech today in $CAPITAL$, just the start of a campaign to gather support among the population and the government for their goal of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME11001;The Dissolution of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11001;\n\nMinisters and bureaucrats arrived in $CAPITAL$ today to find a royal decree at the government's doors: the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch has dissolved the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Upper House, effective immediately, and a new one is to be handpicked by the monarch. The news sent shockwaves through the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nobility - used to the occasional replacements, but not to such an earthshattering and drastic extent. Dissatisfaction is rampant, with many speculating (behind closed doors) that the monarch is setting up minor nobles, mostly sycophants and toadies, to execute the whims of the crown. A few of the old servants of the crown in the nobility kept their positions in order to train and guide the newcomers, but there's already evidence of lasting disruption in the state's affairs.

EVTDESC169001;\n\nDuring my few days of service in this government I've learned of a few secrets and have come across something interesting. The deportation order was issued through official channels by the minister of the interior and sent to the provinces. Following this order the Central Committee circulated its own ominous order to all parties to allow the gangs to carry out their wretched task. Thus the gangs were in the field, ready for their atrocious slaughter... The 'mission' in the circular was: to attack the convoys and massacre the population... I am ashamed as a $COUNTRY_ADJ$. What a stain on the reputation of $COUNTRY$, these criminal people...\nThe first-hand report of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ defector made the newspapers headlines of one of the Great Powers. Soon, more evidence started to appear: in $CAPITAL$, senior government officials scramble to contain the damage of the damning report.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In $CAPITAL$, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities are denying any knowledge of this while they try to suppress this information leaking outside of $COUNTRY$. They say it would damage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ reputation and is best to deal with these matters internally. An ongoing government investigation has failed to find any culprits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Countless asked permission to detail their wrongs, and enforce their claims for RIGHT, and the 'House' has resolved they should not be heard! Countless of the slave-class have held out the olive branch of peace and sought the principle of EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW - and the privileged have refused to enter into a treaty! The same class is to be a slave class still. The assumption of inferiority is still to be maintained. The people are not to be free.\nWhen the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch promised the people the right to vote, they were expecting their voices to be heard - instead, the monarch overruled the election results. In $CAPITAL$, a crowd clamors for their rights to be respected. This blatant disregard of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ constitution is spreading unrest, locking the government and damaging our international reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC96124;\n\nThough Kuwait enjoyed a de facto independence since its birth early in the 18th century, its chiefs acknowledged at different periods the nominal suzerainty of the Ottomans or the Wahhabi Imams of Riyadh. A few years ago, Mohammed bin Sabah succeeded to the chieftainship of the principality. The new ruler was an incompetent person and consequently affairs of the state gradually drifted into the hands of his shrewd brother-in-law, one Yusuf bin Abdullah Al-Ibrahim, which was bent upon a policy of $COUNTRY_ADJ$izing the principality. In Mohammed's half-brother, Mubarak, the patriotic party in Kuwait found a leader of outstanding ability and far-reaching ambitions and soon enough Mubarak assassinated the ruling chief and seized power for himself. Fearing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention in Kuwait, Mubarak entered talks with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Resident in the Gulf who seized this opportunity and convinced Mubarak to become a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A few years ago, Mohammed bin Sabah succeeded to the chieftainship of the principality.

In Mohammed's half-brother, Mubarak, the patriotic party in Kuwait found a leader of outstanding ability and ambitions and soon enough Mubarak assassinated the ruling chief and seized power. As Russian influence grows in the Levant and possibly on Istanbul, the Resident has started to listen and build $COUNTRY_ADJ$ relations with Mubarak.

EVTNAME91170;The Embassy is a Success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91170;\n\nThe delegation we sent to Europe was warmly welcomed and treated to an exclusive showcase at the International Exhibition in London. European locals showed keen interest in our nation's culture and society, and government officials accepted our offers of friendly diplomatic relations. Even though it seems clear that Europeans view the Japanese race as inferior on account of not being Western, they are flattered by our attempts at adopting elements of their culture, warfare, and government structure. Hopefully with due time we can prove to them we are their equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91170OPTA;Fabulous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME91171;The Embassy Fails, Japanese Delegation Shunned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91171;\n\nDespite being treated to an exclusive showcase at the International Exhibition in London, Europe did not give us a warm welcome. Viewing us as an exotic people from a backwater nation, they treated our attempt at diplomacy with skepticism--and they laughed at our proposal to postpone our trade ports' opening. It seems no non-Western nation can hope to win the European's respect, as it is the Europeans who are supposedly the masters of culture and warfare, destined to rule the world. We must prove them wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91171OPTA;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME91172;The Embassy is a Success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91172;\n\nDespite overwhelming odds, our diplomatic effort to make Europe respect our wish to remain isolated succeeded. They have realized our people are only so willing to welcome foreigners after centuries of undisturbed isolation. If they chose to take drastic measures to enforce open trade, such as military action, it would end badly. This is unprecedented: a non-Western power negotiating its isolation from Western encroachment, without bloodshed. As a plus, we have also used our time abroad to learn more about the outside world, furthering our ability to modernize quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91172OPTA;An absolute miracle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME91173;The Embassy Misses its Mark;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91173;\n\nOur second embassy to Europe yielded bittersweet results. We were able to improve relations with the West, but at their insistence the forced opening of our ports remains inevitable. With this said, our continued interest in adopting the virtues of Western civilization flattered our diplomatic hosts. We therefore cannot say this effort was a complete failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91173OPTA;You win some, you lose some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME91174;The Embassy to America Succeeds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91174;\n\nThe United States welcomed our delegation. American officials guided them through a tour of its major cities, showing us the country's proudest cultural and industrial landmarks. The Americans pride themselves on having a higher purpose in history: a country where essential civil freedoms, whichever those may be, are guaranteed. However, being a Western nation, they clearly asserted their opinion that us non-Westerners are inferior, having not adopted the virtues of their civilization without imposition of them on us. With hard work, Japan will surely prove themselves as the West's equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91174OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME91175;The Embassy to America Fails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91175;\n\nThe Americans did not take our diplomacy seriously, having convinced themselves an oriental nation cannot hope to compete among the Western powers.

EVTDESC91179;\n\nA British vessel called the Normanton was wrecked off the cape of Kashinozaki, running aground and forcing its crewmen and passengers to evacuate. The crew all survived and escaped on lifeboats. The 25 Japanese passengers aboard, however, all perished, supposedly without any chance to secure lifeboats for themselves. The case is currently tried in a court for British subjects in Japan. The locals, meanwhile, are highly skeptical of the case's facts: they do not easily believe that the Japanese passengers had no means of surviving, and they speculate the Normanton's crew simply refused to give the passengers lifeboats. The Normanton's crew was all British, save for 12 Indians and Chinese. It is easily assumed that the British crewmen sacrificed the passengers' lives simply because they were Japanese. But because the case is not being adjudicated by our own court, it will be difficult to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC91180;\n\nAfter the sinking of the British merchant navy vessel Normanton off Japan's coast, leaving 25 Japanese passengers dead, Japan has experienced a surge of nationalist agitation. They suspect the crew denied the passengers lifeboats because they were Japanese, while saving the lifeboats for themselves so that all the crewmembers would survive. The Japanese government, however, is choosing to act prudently. They will not challenge our subjects' extraterritoriality in Japan and hope to stay on our good side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They suspect the crew denied the passengers lifeboats because they were Japanese, while saving the lifeboats for themselves so that all the crewmembers would survive. Japan's government has used this incident as reason to request an end to extraterritoriality for British subjects. They want to assure the incident is investigated thoroughly, and the fact that the case is being tried in our own court undermines that effort. They do not want the crew to get off the hook if they are guilty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Harris has now arrived at our shores, demanding the US be considered a "most favored" trading partner with Japan. This sets a dangerous precedent. Should the US get what they want, it will doubtlessly encourage other Western countries to demand trade concessions from us as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But that is soon to change as a momentous shift happened in $YEAR$ that shocked our old allegiances. Our former overlords lost all their influence in $CAPITAL$ and a new power crept in, little by little, until it overwhelmed our former protectors.

A fortification is something tricky to maintain - not only it needs regular assessment of the integrity of walls and gates, but also a constant supply of new armaments, supplies and tools for repair. If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in. After several years of hardship, what is seen in $STATENAME$ is this picture, a consequence of the disastrous bankruptcy that is crushing $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16461;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society announced today in $CAPITAL$ that, thanks to the help of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, their task of repatriating Africans was a resounding success -  there's isn't a single African in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ core territory.

EVTDESC33043;The Ostflucht (flight from the East) is the name being given to the migration of Germans and Poles from the eastern parts of Germany to more industrialized regions in central and western Germany. The causes of this migration are still being studied, with the most preeminent of the scholars being one Max Weber, but it's theorized that a drop in attractiveness to migrate to America combined with an increased demand for industrial workforce in other parts of Germany, increased birth-rates among the poles and poverty in East Germany are the main driving factors for this phenomenon.

In $YEAR$ the Sultan of $FROMCOUNTRY$ went to $CAPITAL$ seeking recognition of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulers over his sultanate as well as some form of recognition of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s independence with a treaty of friendship. The Sultanate was shaken by internal and external threats and the once proud kingdom is now a shell of its former self, weak and fragile.

EVTNAME12030;Production Shortfalls;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12030;\n\nOne of our munitions factories has experienced a severe shortfall in production over the past three months, which has gone unreported for fear of causing alarm among investors and local industrial magnates. By covering the factory's losses with materials from the national stockpile, we could be perceived as saving local jobs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME12050;Tea Weighing Station Robbed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12050;\n\nThe central tea weighing station in one of our tea producing provinces has been held up by armed thugs. Some locals speculate that harsh times in the province might have provoked local farmers, tired of seeing local distributors and retailers eating away at their profits, to rob the station. Whatever the cause may be, we need to address the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME12110;In Them Old Cotton Fields;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12110;\n\nThe cotton produced in one of our provinces is of the highest possible quality and strength. So strong, in fact, is the cotton, that the white balls harvested there have begun building quite a reputation for themselves as being some of the best available in the world. The reputation has built for quite some time, and local farmers have begun taking pride in the fact that, in the world of cotton, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ cotton is a byword for quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC12120;\n\nNot by speeches and votes of the majority, are the great questions of the time decided, but by iron and blood.'\n-Otto von Bismarck\n\nA new, rich lode of minerals has been discovered in the $PROVINCENAME$ mine.

We could attempt to extract the ore, but doing so will carry with it a cost in lives and blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME12130;Cottage Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12130;\n\nThe wool district in one of our provinces became a hub of activity lately, as more and more little cottage weaveries are springing up across the province. While the folk in the province have always been known as a thrifty kind, the ready access to some of the world's best wool might also explain this flurry of activity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Efficient work processes and management, combined with excellent craftsmanship and seamanship, have led the province to produce more and better ships than during any year previous! Perhaps this is the time to rest on the laurels, but, then again, the future is always an uncertainty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The refinery owner has washed his hands of any responsibility for the accident, claiming instead that government safety inspections have been lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VTNAME12190;Overproduction at the Refinery;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12190;\n\nOne of our refineries has been doing well lately, with production exceeding expected quotas by several thousand gallons. Due to storage problems, the refinery owner has approached the government with a deal to buy the fuel at a steep discount. We could either buy the fuel ourselves, or turn him down and wait for him to float the cheap fuel on the market. The local impact of cheap fuel should make the locals fairly happy, but we could probably use the fuel ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC12200;\n\nAnother tragic day for our laborers today, as an accident was reported as having claimed several lives in one of our iron mines.

EVTDESC12220;\n\nThe tea harvest is unusually large this year, and nowhere is it larger than in $COUNTRY$. Everywhere one ventures, sacks and sacks again stand lined up, brimming with freshly picked leaves of wonderfully smelling tea. This harvest will probably set us straight for years if we're capable of leveraging it right. Should we let the farmers keep an extra portion of the harvest, let our merchants sell it for profit, or should we stockpile it for later use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME12230;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Radio;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12230;\n\nA local radio station is facing a shortage of radio components for their transmitters, and have been forced to cease broadcasts until the situation is resolved. Local authorities have suggested lending some of the government's radio components to the station, as it fears that the local populace will be alarmed by a lack of news from the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME12240;In The Drunk Tank;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12240;\n\nMore and more social, religious and educational institutions in $COUNTRY$, primarily from the educated middle classes, are coming to see the influence of alcohol on our society as a moral and social wrong. Pointing at the effects and costs in terms of broken homes, windows and spirits, they urge temperance, with some even going so far as to support calls for outright prohibition. Brewery owners in one of our provinces are concerned by the development, and wish to see their future privilege to sell and manufacture alcohol guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As people's homes are beautified, it only makes sense that the offices of government are, likewise, upgraded to better conform to modern standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME12270;Changing Fashions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12270;\n\nDisaster has struck our luxury clothes factory in one of our provinces, where several shipments have been canceled over the past few weeks. The reason for the cancellations seems to be that the clothes, quite simply, aren't selling all that well, and no wonder, the cut is wrong, and the buttons look almost clownishly large. Strange, they seemed so nice last season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME12280;Moldy Clothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12280;\n\nWater has seeped into a factory warehouse in one of our provinces, damaging several shipping crates' worth of clothing. The clothing has been infected by a pungent smelling mold of some kind, and while it doesn't look so bad, the fiber in the cloth reeks of cellar and stale water. We might be able to salvage the clothes, but there is some doubt as to whether anyone would want to use them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC46305;\n\nThe Cabanagem revolt has had a big toll in the population that it was supposed to liberate - the white population was subject to massacres by Native American militias, and our army has now perpetrated atrocities to pacify the local populations. The Mawe and Mura natives have suffered the biggest toll of the massacres, but other regions have also been affected. At the same time, imports of grain into Pará stopped because of blockades and the local producers were destroyed, voluntarily or involuntarily, in the fighting, resulting in widespread famine in the wider population. Suffice to say, the province will take years to recover to its original population size and its economy is now in shambles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME46610103;The Tacna-Arica Arbitration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46610103;\n\nIn the aftermath of the War of the Pacific, Peru was defeated and forced to sign the Treaty of Ancón. In this Treaty, Tarapacá was annexed to Chile. However, the fate of both Tacna and Arica was to be decided by a plebiscite to be held in 1893. Due to different points of view, both countries were not able to agree on the conditions of this plebiscite and so it was not held. Chile began then to colonize the two territories and Peru answered with a break of diplomatic relations. In $YEAR$, Chile and Peru agreed to arbitrate the dispute with the $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$.

EVTDESC46610102;\n\nWhen Bolivia became independent from Spain on 1825, it took possession of the territories that corresponded to its colonial administration in accordance with the uti possidetis juris of 1810. Bolivia claimed the maritime territory westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean between the Rio Salado on the south and the Rio Loa on the north, which included part of the Atacama Desert. Later in the mid 19th century, Chile made claims to the desert area following the discovery and exploitation of nitrate deposits and the move en masse of its population to work in the new found richness in Antofagasta. Because of that, the following decades were witness to much bloodshed on the borders of Bolivia, Peru and Chile. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put a proposal, with international approval, to solve this problem amicably and set terms for new borders, paying indemnities for all involved.

EVTDESC810003;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats along with representatives from the other Great Powers have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the question of the Danish straits and, more specifically, the Sound Dues. Citing the fact that the world's seafaring nations are becoming less and less tolerant of these tolls and restrictions, they are lobbying for the abolition of the Dues and for the commitment that all Danish straits will be turned into international waterways free to all military and commercial shipping. In compensation for the abolition, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state will receive a one-time fee of 300,000¤.

The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is to be compensated with a sum of 300,000¤. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is acting as the guaranteer, paying at least one third of the total sum while two other European Great Powers with stakes on the negotiations will be asked to pay the remaining two-thirds.

Based on this they argue that we should contribute to the indemnifications owed to the Danish straits controller. We are, of course, not bound by this - we can refuse, but doing so would not only hurt our image in the eyes of other countries, it would also anger $FROMCOUNTRY$: they would feel that we are indebted to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME167000;Druze Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC167000;\n\nBeginning with the Peasant's Revolt of 1834 in Palestine, Druze nobles resented oversight. Their overlords considered them heretics and treated them as such. In the years following the Peasant's Revolt, conscription was required in order to reinforce what the Egyptian army had lost in the revolt. In $YEAR$, Druze militias rose up against their Egyptian rulers in Hauran and defeated a 400-man force led by Ali Agha al-Busayli, the governor of Hauran. A number of other small expeditions followed but were unable to achieve any decisive victory. Druze from Mount Lebanon flooded into the Druze force as skirmishes continued for the next few months. Months later, the Druze were decisively defeated in the Wadi Bakka by Egyptian forces. Following this, Druze forces in Palestine looted the Jewish quarter of Safed while the main force moved south where they were decisively crushed at Shebaa and soon laid down their arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC168000;\n\nWith special protection guarenteed to them by the French, the Maronite economy, driven by an increase in silk output, boomed. Pockets of Maronites were now filled with much-needed money and with it came a desire for better education and a population boom. For the first time, many women had an individual income and began to seek better conditions in both their work and in their general public life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME168010;Mount Lebanon Silk Bust;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC168010;\n\nWith the openings of the Suez Canal and an increase in silk exports from Asian lands, the price of Lebanese silk halved and never recovered. The population boom that Mount Lebanon once experienced resulted in an elevated population that could no longer support itself on Lebanese soil.

When they returned with this news, a team of archaeologists was dispatched to the site. They were able to document and catalog a large number of artifacts from the site.

EVTNAME168030;Missionaries in Beirut;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC168030;\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, Lebanon had an increasing amount of Western missionaries visit it. Many of these missionaries established school and printing presses in Beirut which catered to the city's Christian population. Despite this recent surge, education was not a new concept for Lebanese Christians. A Syriac printing press was established in 1610 and Jesuits founded a school in 1624. American missionaries began their efforts in 1834 with another printing press and school. By the mid 1840s, it was noted by American missionaries that between a quarter and a third of men in Lebanon were literate and by the beginning of the 20th century nearly half of all Lebanese children could read, a feat which was hardly matched anywhere outside of the West at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At this time it, it is the third largest known earthquake, with the main places suffering damage being Potenza, Polla, Diano, Sala, and Padula in the Val di Diano, and Tito, Sarconi, Marsico Nuovo, Saponara, and Montemurro. The latter two places, along with Padula and Polla, were virtually completely destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC21524;\n\nA series of major earthquakes struck Japan during the Ansei era became known as the Ansei Great Earthquakes. Scores of people died while tsunamis and fires destroyed thousands of buildings. In Edo alone, a total of about 50,000 houses and over 50 temples were either destroyed by the earthquake shaking or subsequent fires. The earthquakes were blamed on a giant catfish, Namazu, thrashing about and Ukiyo-e prints depicting Namazu became very popular around this time. The significance being that earthquakes at the time were popularly attributed to the thrashing about of a mythological catfish under the earth, normally kept under control by the deity Kashima using a large rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA21524;We pray that Kashima favor us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21523;\n\nOn the evening of $YEAR$, communities along the Sanriku coast in northern Japan were celebrating a Shinto holiday. After a small earthquake, there was little concern because it was so weak and many small tremors had also been felt in the previous few months. However 35 minutes later the first tsunami wave struck the coast, followed by a second a few minutes later. The waves reached a height of 38.2m and caused such damage that the event is one of the most destructive seismic events in Japanese history. The power of the tsunami was great: large numbers of victims were found with broken bodies or missing limbs. As was their normal practice each evening, the local fishing fleets were all at sea when the tsunamis struck. In the deep water the wave went unnoticed. Only when they returned the next morning did they discover the debris and bodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21521;\n\nHouses crumbled in the middle of the night as the earth itself threatened to rip apart. The shaking lasted for five minutes at Caleta Pabellón de Pica, a coastal town 70km south of Iquique. The earthquake caused significant damage over most of the coastal parts of the Tarapacá and Antofagasta Regions. The tsunami caused a 10m  wave along about 500km of coast, from Arica in the north to Mejillones in the south. At Arica the water reached the cathedral. The hulk of the U.S. gunboat Wateree, which had been beached hundreds of meters inland by the final wave of the tsunami triggered by the Arica earthquake, was moved several kilometers to the north along the coast and nearer the shoreline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21522;\n\nIn a calm night of $YEAR$ in Arica, the earth suddenly shook and started to sunder. The earthquake shaking lasted somewhere between five and ten minutes and caused almost complete destruction in the southern part of Peru, including Arica, Tacna, Moquegua, Mollendo, Ilo, Iquique, Torata and Arequipa. Then, the first wave arrived at Arica 52 minutes after the earthquake, with a 12m height, followed by the largest 16m wave 73 minutes later. The tsunami drove three ships anchored in port nearly 800m inland: the 1560-ton Peruvian corvette America, the U.S. gunboat Wateree and the U.S. store ship Fredonia, which was completely destroyed, as well as causing considerable damage in Hawaii, washing out a bridge along the Waiohi river. The port city of Pisco, in Ica, was razed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC21520;\n\nA major earthquake has struck San Francisco, California, today, causing widespread devastation and the loss of thousands of lives. Tremors have been reported as far away inland as Nevada, but as damaging as the earthquake and its aftershocks were, the fires that burned out of control afterward were even more destructive. Within three days, over 30 fires, caused by ruptured gas mains, destroyed approximately 25,000 buildings on 490 city blocks. Due to a widespread practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, most of the destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties, in order to claim them on their insurance. In all, the fires burned for four days and nights. Army units are hard at work bringing in supplies to the survivors, and we can rest assured that the quake will leave its mark on public memory for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21500;The Tunguska Event;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21500;\n\n'At breakfast time I was sitting by the house at Vanavara. I suddenly saw that directly to the north, over Tunguska Road, the sky split in two and fire appeared high and wide over the forest. The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire northern side was covered with fire. From the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat. Then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, throwing me a few meters. I lost my senses for a moment, but then my wife ran out and led me to the house. After that such noise came, as if rocks were falling or cannons were firing and the earth shook. When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between the houses, like from cannons, which left traces in the ground like pathways, and it damaged some crops. Later we saw that many windows were shattered.'\nThe Tunguska explosion of $YEAR$ produced a devastating fireball in Siberia and it's the largest impact event on Earth in recorded history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21510;\n\nThe eruption of the Krakatoa volcano and the resultant tsunami left over 36500 dead in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ East Indies, and the sound of the eruption was heard 3000 miles away at Rodrigues Island in the Indian Ocean. Over 70% of the island and its surrounding archipelago were destroyed as it collapsed into a caldera. Additional seismic activity and tsunamis were reported to have continued and the eruption was one of the deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. The explosion had a tremendous global impact, with the sky darkening worldwide for years afterwards, producing intensely red sunsets and other optical effects, as well as global average temperature dropping by more than a degree Celsius.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This new constitution, dubbed 'The Turkish Constitution', would repel civil liberties and has the backing of Serbia's guarantor, Russia, and of Austria. Bowing to the Sublime Porte wishes means the abdication of the current Serbian Prince, currently under pressure to implement the 1835 constitution, and the confirmation of Turkish sovereignty over Serbia. Defying their commands might spell a difficult war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, under ambiguous circumstances, their evacuation turned into a massacre, and most of the men were killed. As a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rescue force approached $PROVINCENAME$, 120 $COUNTRY_ADJ$ women and children captured by the rebel forces were killed in what came to be known as the $PROVINCENAME$ Massacre, their remains being thrown down a nearby well in an attempt to hide the evidence. Following the discovery of the massacre, the outraged $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces engaged in widespread retaliation against captured rebel soldiers and local civilians. The murders greatly embittered the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rank-and-file against the rebels and inspired the war cry "Remember $PROVINCENAME$!";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The treaty would establish the border from the Rio Negro northwestward along the Amazon River-Orinoco watershed divide, then generally southward along various river courses and straight-line segments to the mouth of the Apaporis River.

EVTDESC111001;\n\nKassa Hailu began his military career as a destitute shifta, an outlaw. After a political marriage to try to stop his ascension and after losing several battles, the warlord of $COUNTRY$ lost his power and Kassa took control. With a dream of reunifying Ethiopia, he claimed the imperial throne for himself. He moved the capital city of the Empire to Debre Tabor and later to Magdala. He ended the division of Ethiopia among the various warlords and princes that had vied for power for almost two centuries and forcibly re-incorporated the regions of Gojjam and Wollo under the direct administration of the Imperial throne after they had been ruled by local branches of the Imperial dynasty or other warlords. With all of his rivals apparently subdued, he imprisoned them and their relatives at Magdala. He was crowned in $YEAR$, in the imperial city of Gonder, as Tewodros the Second, Negusa Nagast - King of Kings - Emperor of Ethiopia, the Elect of God, Son of David and Solomon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Beginning as a shifta, an outlaw, he amassed a sizable force and took back his father's previous fief of Qwara. He gained popular support by his benevolent treatment of the inhabitants in the areas he controlled. This garnered the attention of the warlord in control of $COUNTRY$ and when he became too powerful to ignore, to deal with him without using force, he was named dajazmach of Qwara and married to the daughter of the warlord. The disdainful treatment he received from his in-laws led to him capturing $CAPITAL$ by surprise. After Kassa retreated to the south, the Empress and mother of the ruler of $COUNTRY$ led an army pursuing him. Kassa defeated them and captured the Empress and now we need deal with him. There are those who favor giving him a bigger fief in return for the release of the Empress but this will increase his power, to the point the current lord could lose control of $COUNTRY$ to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC110029;\n\nIn 1864 until the early 20th century, another mass expulsion took place of Caucasian Muslims as a result of the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian and North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks. Many of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade. Formed in 1879 in Persia. It was modeled after the Caucasian Cossack regiments of the Imperial Russian Army and, until 1920, it was commanded by Russian officers.

The new 'Majiles' - the Parliament - worked hard, pushing negotiations on many issues against the central authority.

EVTDESC110060;\n\nIn $YEAR$, a number of American immigrants in Alta California raised and rebelled against the local Mexican government before seizing military control the area to the north of the San Francisco Bay, in the present-day state of California. The immigrants had not been allowed to buy or rent land and had been threatened with expulsion because Mexican officials were concerned about the incoming influx of unregulated Americans in a climate of quickly rising tensions with the US. The term "California Republic" appeared on the flag the insurgents raised and indicated their aspiration of forming a republican government for California. The flag featured an image of a California grizzly bear and became known as the Bear Flag and the revolt as the Bear Flag Revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC110053;Victorio was a fierce warrior and chief of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh division of the central Apaches. For ten years, he and his band were moved to and left at least three different reservations, some more than once, despite his band's request to live on traditional lands. Wandering around the US-Mexico border, they were successful at raiding and evading capture by the military and even won a significant engagement at Las Animas Canyon before allegedly leading the Alma Massacre. In $YEAR$, while moving along the Rio Grande in northern Mexico, Victorio and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army in the Tres Castillos Mountains, in Chihuahua.

Why did you not take the opportunity of my coming to Kumasi to bring the Golden Stool for me to sit upon?'. Not understanding the significance of the stool, he clearly had no inkling of the storm his words would produce: the suggestion that he, a foreigner, should sit upon and defile the Golden Stool, the very embodiment of the Ashanti state, and very symbol of the Ashanti peoples, living, dead, and yet to be born, was far too insufferable for the crowd.

While stationing in Honolulu, he quickly found himself in the middle of a feud between the British Consul Charlton and the Prime Minister of Hawaii, an American named Judd. The former claimed that British subjects in the Islands were being denied their legal rights: thus, when Paulet arrived at Honolulu he requested an audience with King Kamehameha III, tensions quickly rose between the locals, their American allies and the British elites - especially after Paulet militarily occupied the Islands.

EVTDESC110078;\n\nJack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in $YEAR$. Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. The "From Hell" letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee included half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as "Jack the Ripper", mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders and because of media treatment of the events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He has proven to be a very capable young man, though he is quite shy, and he is much beloved by the people. Due to the poor rulership of the regency, it will be immediately terminated, and Dom Pedro II will officially begin his reign as Emperor of Brazil. His father's abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in order to restore his daughter on the throne of Portugal left him a five-year-old Emperor and led to his grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Still, he has grown into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME110075;The Death of Pedro II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC110075;\n\nThe support for the monarchy remained overwhelming in the country and none ever dreamed of having it otherwise. Pedro II was as popular as ever, a father for each of his citizens. Still, letters he wrote reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. His last couple of years were lonely and melancholic and his health had considerably worsened. One day in $YEAR$, while residing in Paris, he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia Pedro rapidly declined and died surrounded by his family. His last words were 'May God grant me these last wishes: peace and prosperity for Brazil!'. While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: 'It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland.';;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC110056;\n\nThe H. L. Hunley was one of the first submarine built by the CSA, but named and mostly financed after its main inventor, Horace Lawson Hunley. It played a small but symbolic part in the American Civil War by demonstrating the advantages and dangers of undersea warfare. She was the first combat submarine to actually sink a warship, which was an important step in the naval arms-race going on at the time: indeed, the Yankees had also developed their first submarine, the USS Alligator, while the Confederation had already lost two prototypes.

The boat had already sank two times before, killing 13 men, including Horace Hunley himself. But Dixon and a crew of seven volunteers successfully navigated the waters and aimed to reach the blockade. There, they spotted the USS Housatonic and began their approach. While the Yankees did see them, they were unable to fight back and the Hunley launched its torpedo swinging in the flank of the 1,260t vessel, sinking it in less than five minutes. The men then set for home and narrowly made it. Thus, the Hunley became the first submarine ship to successfully sink an enemy boat, marking History forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC110050;\n\nGuided Democracy was the political system in place in Indonesia until the New Order began. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. He believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesia's situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme ('nationalism'), agama ('religion'), and komunisme ('communism') into a co-operative 'Nas-A-Kom' government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics - the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed, 'Guided Democracy' - western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the Reformasi era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The first half was originally a serial in 1881 and 1882, and then later completed as a book for children in February 1883. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio and his father, a poor woodcarver named Geppetto. It is considered a canonical piece of children's literature and has inspired hundreds of adaptations, from new editions or stage plays to movies, and has been translated in over 240 languages worldwide, making it among the most widely read books ever written.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16459;\n\nAfter fairly favorable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters, which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the prairies region in $COUNTRY$ entered an unusually dry era in the summer of $YEAR$. During the drought of the 1930s, the unanchored soil turned to dust, which the prevailing winds blew away in huge clouds that sometimes blackened the sky. These choking billows of dust (named "black blizzards" or "black rollers") traveled cross country, reaching as far as the East Coast and striking such cities as New York City and Washington, D.C.\nOn the Plains, they often reduced visibility to 1 meter (3.3 ft) or less.

EVTNAME16180;Free Staters;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16180;\n\nDuring the most intense days of the slavery debate, some abolitionists organized emigration to the territories of Kansas and Nebraska in order to prevent these territories from being admitted into the Union as slave-states. The theory of popular sovereignty held that a democratic vote in the state would decide on whether the state should be constituted as slave or free.

EVTNAME16150;Copperheads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16150;\n\nThe 'Copperheads' were a group of Democrats in the Northern United States who, during the Civil War, opposed the war, and favored a peace settlement with the South. The moniker came originally from Unionists likening them to poisonous snakes, but it soon struck home with the Copperheads themselves. While there is no war yet, there is staunch resistance to abolitionism within some democratic circles in a few states. Stepping up the local political campaigning could probably neutralize them, but only at the cost of offending southern sentiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1010034;\n\nEnclosure is the legal process of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm. Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. This results in less land for the people to cultivate.

EVTNAME315004;How I Found Livingstone;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC315004;\n\nOur hearts and our feelings are with our eyes, as we peer into the palms and try to make out in which hut or house lives the white man with the gray beard we heard about on the Malagarazi (...) We are now about three hundred yards from the village and the crowds are dense about me. I pushed back the crowds and walked down a living avenue of people until I came in front of the semicircle of Arabs, in the front of which stood the white man with the gray beard. As I advanced slowly toward him I noticed he was pale, looked wearied, had a gray beard, wore a bluish cap with a faded gold band round it, had on a red-sleeved waistcoat and a pair of gray tweed trousers. I would have run to him, only I was a coward in the presence of such a mob, - would have embraced him, only, he being an Englishman, I did not know how he would receive me, so I did what cowardice and false pride suggested was the best thing, - walked deliberately to him, took off my hat, and said:;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Her coronation is scheduled for the 28th of June, 1838, when princess Alexandrina Victoria of House Hanover will officially ascend to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as 'Queen Victoria'. Her reign, which would last even a few years into the 20th century, would later be remembered as the absolute zenith of the British Empire, upon which the sun never set. The last British Monarch of the House of Hanover, her ascension also marked the end of the personal union between Britain and Hanover which, under Salic Law, excludes women from inheritance. Her uncle became King Ernest Augustus I of Hanover. Today a jubilant crowd in London has escorted the young Queen Victoria to her residence in the newly reformed Buckingham Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A few abuses were reported here and there, but this was usually passed as corruption or power abuse. The $MONARCHTITLE$ was never involved or held liable for those. This situation, however, led to the Great Powers closely watching the Congo and an international recognition of the Congo right to exist.

Despite all that, improvements in the Congo had been made and there was no over exploitation of the natives. Running the risk of corporations causing a humanitarian disaster because of over exploitation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ upper house decided, in a move coordinated and approved by other Great Power, to remove the $MONARCHTITLE$ as the sole personal ruler of the Congo and put it under control of $COUNTRY$ with all the legal institutions and guarantees that came with it.

They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace... the people who were demanded for the forced labor gangs, and the soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.' The mass-deaths in the CFS became a cause célèbre in $YEAR$. The Congo reform movement led a vigorous international movement against the maltreatment of the Congolese population.

Being too lenient and using it solely for philanthropic work might cement the country's destiny as a civilizing experiment, forever barring it from being a colony. Pushing the natives to meet the production quotas, on the other hand, might lead to abuse that can give our opposition and the humanitarian organizations some ammunition against us. While that will not hinder any plans of colonizing the Congo, it will certainly affect our reputation in the eyes of the world. The optimal solution would be maintaining balance for long enough that the philanthropic excuse doesn't collapse at the same time that our imperialistic plans for the Congo slowly become recognized and legitimized.

The $MONARCHTITLE$ pledged to suppress the East African slave trade, promote humanitarian policies, guarantee free trade within the colony, impose no import duties for twenty years and to encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in $YEAR$, however, the $MONARCHTITLE$ began to issue a series of decrees that violated these conditions. It was first decreed that the State asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo. Afterwards, the rights of the Congolese were reduced in their land to native villages and farms, making nearly all of the CFS crown lands. We can continue these policies which will lead to an eventual annexation, revert them or simply take control of the CFS, dealing with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME955184;The Congo Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC955184;\n\nDuring the Congo Conference, a 14-nation conference convened to submit the Congo question to international control and to finalize the colonial partitioning of the African continent. Most major powers attended the Congo Conference, and drafted an international code governing the way that European countries should behave as they acquired African territory. The conference, however, failed to recognize the International Association of the Congo's claims to the Congo and bids of humanitarian aid and philanthropic work fell to the pressures of economic interests and imperialism. The Great Powers of the world now scramble to, under the principle of effective occupation, acquire control over the Congo regions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Still, you can assure His Majesty of my whole-hearted sympathy for the generous plan he had conceived, as long as the Congo does not make any international difficulties for us.\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Prime Minister has been quoted saying after European leaders officially recognized the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ control over the 2,600,000 km2 of the Congo Free State. In $YEAR$, thanks to the successful lobbying of businessman Henry Shelton Sanford at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ request, the United States decided that the cessions claimed by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ from the local leaders were lawful and recognized the International Association of the Congo's claim on the region, becoming the first country to do so. The Congo Conference officially recognized the International Congo Association and specified that it should have no connection with $COUNTRY$ or any other country, but would be under the personal control of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The great powers of Europe have been called to vote and decide on the future of the Congo: if they will concede to $FROMCOUNTRY$'s wishes, if they deny their request or if they wish to abstain from the decision. If we agree, we will be obliged to surrender any territories we currently posses in the region.

EVTNAME23485;The Thirty-second Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23485;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist performed a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis for an experiment conducted in Paris was untenable. He repeated the creation of the radiation using beryllium, used better approaches to detection, and aimed the radiation at paraffin following the Paris experiment. Paraffin is high in hydrogen content, hence offers a target dense with protons, since neutrons and protons have almost equal mass, protons scatter energetically from neutrons. He measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton: these particles were neutrons. In $YEAR$ he was nominated and won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for the discovery of the neutron".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23483;The Thirty-first Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23483;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist developed an equation in quantum mechanics that bears his namesake. The equation is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time. It was formulated in late 1925, and published in 1926. In $YEAR$, he was nominated and won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23482;The Thirtieth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23482;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist published a puzzling paper. The main new idea, non-commuting matrices, is justified only by a rejection of unobservable quantities. It introduces the non-commutative multiplication of matrices by physical reasoning, based on the correspondence principle, despite the fact that he was not then familiar with the mathematical theory of matrices. In a series of experiments with other scientists, he solved problem of the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source. He then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the perturbation methods that he had developed. In $YEAR$ he won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23480;The Twenty-ninth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23480;\n\nDuring a voyage in 1921, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist noticed the blue color of glaciers and the Mediterranean sea. He was motivated to discover the reason for the blue color. He carried out experiments regarding the scattering of light by water and transparent blocks of ice which explained the phenomenon. In an experiment, je employed monochromatic light from a mercury arc lamp which penetrated transparent material and was allowed to fall on a spectrograph to record its spectrum. He detected lines in the spectrum and he presented his theory at a meeting of scientists in $CAPITAL$ on 16 March 1928, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23479;The Twenty-eighth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23479;\n\nThe fundamental idea of my 1924 thesis was the following: The fact that, following the introduction of photons in light waves, one knew that light contains particles which are concentrations of energy incorporated into the wave, suggests that all particles, like the electron, must be transported by a wave into which it is incorporated... My essential idea was to extend to all particles the coexistence of waves and particles discovered in 1905 in the case of light and photons. In $YEAR$, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist theory was proven by experiments and he won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23478;The Twenty-seventh Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23478;\n\nIn 1901, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ demonstrated that the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the Arrhenius equation. This became known as a law that takes his namesake: "If then the negative radiation is due to the corpuscles coming out of the metal, the saturation current s should obey the law". In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23477;The Twenty-sixth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23477;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, particularly interested in meteorology, in 1893 began to study clouds and their properties. He worked for some time at the national observatory, where he made observations of cloud formation. He then tried to reproduce this effect on a smaller scale in the laboratory in $CAPITAL$, expanding humid air within a sealed container. He later experimented with the creation of cloud trails in his chamber caused by ions and radiation. For the invention of the cloud chamber he received the Nobel Prize in $YEAR$, officially "for his method of making the paths of electrically charged particles visible by condensation of vapor", dividing the honor with another scientist "for his discovery of the effect named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23476;The Twenty-fifth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23476;\n\nIn 1895, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist showed that cathode rays were of negative electric charge in nature. He determined Avogadro's number (now known as the Avogadro constant) by several methods. He explained solar energy as due to the thermonuclear reactions of hydrogen. His most famous work is, however is his theoretical explanation of Brownian motion in terms of atoms. He did the experimental work to test and verify another scientist predictions, thereby settling the century-long dispute about John Dalton's atomic theory. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ for this and other work on the discontinuous structure of matter, which put a definite end to the long struggle regarding the question of the physical reality of molecules. Officially, his award mentions "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter, and especially for his discovery of sedimentation equilibrium".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23475;The Twenty-fourth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23475;\n\nTwo $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientists developed an experiment, which took their name, and that was the first electrical measurement to clearly show the quantum nature of atoms and thus "transformed our understanding of the world". They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapor of mercury atoms. They discovered that, when an electron collided with a mercury atom, it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9 electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. This energy loss corresponds to decelerating the electron from a speed of about 1.3 million meters per second to zero. A faster electron doesn't decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy. In $YEAR$ they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23474;The Twenty-third Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23474;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements. He developed a convention for naming the different spectral lines that are characteristic to elements in X-ray spectroscopy that gained his name. His precision measurements drove many developments in quantum theory and atomic physics and "for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy" he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23473;The Twenty-second Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23473;\n\nStarting in 1908, while a professor at the University of $CAPITAL$, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ professor worked on an oil-drop experiment in which he measured the charge on a single electron. Previously, another scientist already discovered the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. However, the actual charge and mass values were unknown. Therefore, if one of these two values were to be discovered, the other could easily be calculated. He and his then graduate student used an oil-drop experiment to measure the charge of the electron (as well as the electron mass, and Avogadro's number, since their relation to the electron charge was known) and in $YEAR$, "for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect", he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23472;The Twenty-first Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23472;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist developed a model of the atom which takes his name, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analyzed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated his thinking in both science and philosophy. In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23471;The Twentieth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23471;\n\nBased on calculations a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity. In 1919 that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science - New Theory of the Universe - Newtonian Ideas Overthrown". In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", as his theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23470;The Nineteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23470;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist discovered a nickel-steel alloys he named invar and elinvar. Invar has a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion, making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature. Elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the modulus of elasticity, making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature, such as the marine chronometer. Elinvar is also non-magnetic, which is a secondary useful property for anti-magnetic watches. His work got him a Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$, "in recognition of the service he has rendered to precision measurements in Physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23469;The Eighteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23469;\n\nA well accomplished $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist, that published more than 300 papers, mainly regarding electricity and other such topics, discovered an effect that got his namesake and that is described as "the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to presence of an external electric field". Additionally, "for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields" he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23468;The Seventeenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23468;\n\nAt first, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist considered that quantization was only "a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it...", nowadays this assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of his career. The discovery of the constant that was named after him enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the length and the mass, both named after hi,), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of his fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, Quantum Physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$, officially "in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23467;The Sixteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23467;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist made significant progress in developing and refining the laws of X-ray scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, the principles governing the transmission of X-rays through matter, and especially the principles of the excitation of secondary X-rays. For his discovery of the characteristic X-rays of elements he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$, officially "for his discovery of the characteristic X-ray radiation of the elements".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23466;This Year Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23466;\n\nThe lack of a suitable Nobel Prize candidate in Physics this year meant that no Nobel Prize was awarded in this area. The prize money was allocated to the Special Fund of this prize section.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA23466;That's disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23465;The Fifteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23465;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist at the University of $CAPITAL$, working with X-rays, invented the X-ray spectrometer and with his son, a research student at $CAPITAL$, founded the new science of X-ray crystallography - a tool used for identifying the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds, their disorder and various other information. Together with his son he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23464;The Fourteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23464;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, on a walk through a garden in $CAPITAL$ in January, was discussing with a PhD student about the student's thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to the student were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence much larger than the spacing between the resonators in his crystal model. The physicist seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, they reported to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Physics Society on the successful diffraction of x-rays, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in $YEAR$, "for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23463;The Thirteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23463;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist exploited the Hampson-Linde cycle to investigate how materials behave when cooled to nearly absolute zero. On 10 July 1908, he was the first to liquefy helium, using several precooling stages and the Hampson-Linde cycle based on the Joule-Thomson effect. This way he lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium (-269 °C, 4.2 K). By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved a temperature near 1.5 K, the coldest temperatures ever achieved on earth. His production of extreme cryogenic temperatures led to his discovery of superconductivity in 1911: for certain materials, electrical resistance abruptly vanishes at very low temperatures. His work was recognized with the award of the thirteenth Nobel Prize In Physics "for his investigations on the properties of matter at low temperatures which led, inter alia, to the production of liquid helium" in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23462;The Twelfth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23462;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ inventor working with acetylene invented Agamassan (Aga), a substrate used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white-light and immediately superseded the duller-flamed LPG as the fuel of choice in lighthouse illuminations. He developed a light that bears his name, which incorporated another invention, the 'sun valve', a device that allowed the light to operate only at night. His 'Flasher' was a device that, except for a small pilot light, only consumed gas during the flash stage, reducing gas consumption by more than 90%. To a rugged coastal area like Scandinavia, his mass-produced, minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood and AGA Lighthouses eventually covered the entire Panama Canal. In $YEAR$, "for his invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys", he was awarded the twelfth Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23461;The Eleventh Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23461;\n\nWhile studying streams of ionized gas, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, in 1898, identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom. This particle was accepted and named the proton. He also formulated an expression for the black-body radiation which is correct in the photon-gas limit. His arguments were based on the notion of adiabatic invariance, and were instrumental for the formulation of a field some scientists are calling quantum mechanics. In $YEAR$, "for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat", he was awarded the eleventh Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23460;The Tenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23460;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, in his dissertation "On the continuity of the gas and liquid state", derived the equation of state bearing his name. His work gave a model in which the liquid and the gas phase of a substance merge into each other in a continuous manner. It shows that the two phases are of the same nature. In deriving his equation of state, he assumed not only the existence of molecules (a disputed topic) but also that they are of finite size and attract each other, one of the first scientists to postulate an intermolecular force. His work was recognized and in $YEAR$ he was awarded the tenth Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23459;The Ninth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23459;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ inventor conducting experiments, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home with the help of his butler. His goal: to use radio waves to create a practical system of "wireless telegraphy" - i.e. the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the electric telegraph. This was not a new idea - numerous investigators had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. He used a spark-gap transmitters plus coherer-receivers, similar configurations that had been tried by others, but many were unable to achieve transmission ranges of more than a few hundred meters. His, however, proved successful and together with another scientist in $YEAR$ he was awarded the Ninth Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23458;The Eighth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23458;\n\nOn 2 February 1891, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, interested in a method of fixing the colors of the solar spectrum on a photographic plate, announced to the Academy of Sciences: "I have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colors on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration." By April 1892, he was able to report that he had succeeded in producing color images of a stained glass window, a group of flags, a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a multicolored parrot. He presented his theory of color photography using the interference method in two papers to the Academy, one in 1894, the other in 1906 and for "for his method of reproducing colors photographically based on the phenomenon of interference" he was awarded the Eighth Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23457;The Seventh Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23457;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Midshipman, fascinated with the sciences and the problem of measuring the speed of light in particular, conducted his first experiments of the speed of light, as part of a class demonstration in 1877. His experiment was refined, and in 1879, he measured the speed of light in air to be 299,864 ± km/s and estimated the speed of light in vacuum as 299,940 km/s. After two years of studies in Europe, he resigned from the Navy in 1881. In 1883 he accepted a position as professor of physics at the University of $CAPITAL$ and concentrated on developing an improved interferometer. In 1887 he carried out an experiment which seemed to rule out the existence of the aether. He later moved on to use astronomical interferometers in the measurement of stellar diameters and in measuring the separations of binary stars. Finally, in $YEAR$, he won the seventh Nobel Prize in Physics "for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid".;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC23456;\n\nAs the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in which this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving along the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter... If, in the very intense electric field in the neighborhood of the cathode, the molecules of the gas are dissociated and are split up, not into the ordinary chemical atoms, but into these primordial atoms, which we shall for brevity call corpuscles, and if these corpuscles are charged with electricity and projected from the cathode by the electric field, they would behave exactly like the cathode rays. In $YEAR$ a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist was nominated and won the Sixth Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23451;The First Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23451;\n\nDuring last year a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist was investigating the external effects from the various types of vacuum tube equipment when an electrical discharge is passed through them, speculating that a new kind of ray might be possible. He ate and slept in his laboratory as he investigated many properties of the new rays he temporarily termed "X-rays", using the mathematical designation ("X") for something unknown. In $YEAR$ he published his paper, "On A New Kind Of Rays", and the new rays came to bear his name in many languages. For his discovery he was nominated and subsequently was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23452;The Second Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23452;\n\nA man of remarkable intellectual powers... Although steeped in his own investigation of the moment, he always seemed to have in his immediate grasp its ramifications into every corner of the universe... The singular clearness of his writings provides a striking reflection of his wonderful powers in this respect... He possessed and successfully employed the mental vivacity which is necessary to follow the interplay of discussion, the insight which is required to extract those statements which illuminate the real difficulties, and the wisdom to lead the discussion among fruitful channels, and he did this so skillfully that the process was hardly perceptible. In $YEAR$, Two $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientists won the second Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the extraordinary service they rendered by their researches into the influence of magnetism upon radiation phenomena".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23453;The Third Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23453;\n\nOne wraps a photographic plate with a bromide emulsion in two sheets of very thick black paper, such that the plate does not become clouded upon being exposed to the sun for a day. One places on the sheet of paper, on the outside, a slab of the phosphorescent substance, and one exposes the whole to the sun for several hours. When one then develops the photographic plate, he recognizes that the silhouette of the phosphorescent substance appears in black on the negative. If one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen pierced with a cut-out design, he sees the image of these objects appear on the negative. One must conclude from these experiments that the phosphorescent substance in question emits rays which pass through the opaque paper and reduce silver salts. A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientists have been awarded the third Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the extraordinary services rendered by their discovery of spontaneous radioactivity".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23454;The Fourth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23454;\n\nOn $YEAR$ a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ professor of the $CAPITAL$ University was giving a lecture in which he pointed out that nitrogen isolated from the air had a density slightly higher than that of nitrogen prepared from chemical sources. A liter of pure nitrogen gas generated from a chemical reaction weighed 1.2505 g. On the other hand, a liter of nitrogen gas generated from air by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor weighed 1.2572 g (at the same temperature and pressure). He thought that there might be an unrecognized new element hiding in the air, and that there might be room for this in a new Group at the end of the Periodic Table. When examinations had finished, he set about attempting to isolate this 'impurity' and "for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of argon in connection with these studies" he was awarded the fourth Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23455;The Fifth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23455;\n\nIn $YEAR$ a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist was awarded the Fifth Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on cathode rays". Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive, partially evacuated glass tubes that had metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage could be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study using this arrangement, because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. Lenard overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They filed opposing lawsuits through the office of the Sining Prefect and the judge in the case decided not to issue a ruling on which group was superior to the other in matters of all Islamic affairs, and urged them to behave. As a result, both groups resorted to violence. A taotai was sent by $COUNTRY$ to crush the perpetrators of the violence, which ended in several deaths. This led the involved parties in the dispute to rebel against $COUNTRY$.

At the Battle of Logandème, Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof, King of Sine, was defeated. After his victory, Faidherbe gave the order for Fatick and its surrounding villages to be burned to the ground. Nearby, the European settlement of Kaolack is being founded to colonize the area. Faidherbe's envisions an empire stretching to the Niger and his campaigns have angered the local rulers.

A Tobacco Régie (monopoly) was subsequently established and all the producers and owners of tobacco were forced to sell their goods to agents of the Régie, who would then resell the purchased tobacco. The concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and bazaaris whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business. Mass protests against the Régie began to emerge in major Iranian cities, spearheaded by the bazaari.

As originally envisioned the purchase would encompass a large region, extending far enough south to include the Mexican state of Sonora for the quantity of 100,000¤. The Mexican people opposes such boundaries, as do anti-slavery $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Senators, who see the purchase as acquisition of more slave territory. Even the sale of a relatively small strip of land will anger the Mexican people but we could sell Tucson and Animas, the minimum required to allow the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ to build their railway, for 50,000¤. Finally, not selling anything might anger the Americans ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was brought to trial in Tabriz and in $YEAR$ he was sentenced to death for apostasy. The night before his execution, a young Bábí called Anís threw himself at the feet of the Báb and begged to be killed with him. Both were taken to the courtyard of the barracks the next day where thousands of people had gathered to watch the execution. They were suspended on a wall in front of a large squad of Christian soldiers, the order was given to fire and the courtyard was filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and Anís was unharmed: the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the ropes. There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. The Báb was subsequently found in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his secretary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC900022;\n\nA twenty four years old merchant from Shiraz, called Siyyid 'Alí Muhammad Shírází, on May 22, 1844, claimed to be an inspired interpreter of the Qur'an within the Shaykhi school of Twelver Shi'ism. Within five months, eighteen disciples of the Skaykhi school had independently recognized him as a Manifestation of God. These eighteen disciples were later known as the Letters of the Living. In his early writings, Siyyid appears to identify himself as the gate (báb) to the Hidden Twelfth Imam and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God. After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in $YEAR$ and presented himself to the authorities. But his teachings, which became known as Bábism, were already being spread by his disciples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC37240;\n\nIn 1871 the civil authorities repudiated guarantees made to tribal chieftains by the previous military government for loans to replenish their seed supply. This act alienated even pro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Muslim leaders, while it undercut their ability to control their people. It was against this background of misery and hopelessness that the stricken Kabyles rose in revolt.

Its gross weight is 109.59 kg and the trimmed weight is 78 kg. At the time of the discovery there were no scales capable of weighing a nugget this large, so it was broken into three pieces on an anvil by Dunolly-based blacksmith Archibald Wall. The nugget was soon melted down and the gold was sent as ingots to Melbourne for forwarding to the Bank of $COUNTRY$. It still remains the biggest gold nugget ever found.\nAll around Australia, this finding triggered gold rushes, prospecting and expeditions.

Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as it could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. It began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as its angle in the water became steeper. Ships in $YEAR$ were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels so Titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board.

In regard to these interests the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government will come to an understanding with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Government. The agreement which may be come to on the subject between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$ shall be communicated to another Great Power Government. \n The Spanish government approached us with a proposal for the partition of Morocco: They would control the northern provinces of Ajdir and Tetouan and the southern province of Cape Juby and Ifni.

The library, the doors of which was locked and sealed, was forced open and ransacked, books and manuscripts burnt and destroyed. The colossal crystal lustre, with its artfully concealed music, was smashed to atoms. \n A rally organized by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Communist party marched in the government palace, spearheaded by the Red Guard, its armed arm that is funded by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.

'Come, comrades, let's show that we're not thieves and bandits.' \n The Red Guard of the Communist Party is spearheading a rally towards the government Palace in $CAPITAL$. They demand nothing less than the dissolution of the government and the formation of a new one, controlled by the Communist Party.

A bloody coup is being fought off in the stairs and corridors of the governmental palace and in the street between pro-government forces and the paramilitary clad in their black uniforms.

EVTDESC96173;\n\nThe seeds of the revolution of $YEAR$ were sown prior to the Congress of Vienna, in 1812. This was during the tumultuous Napoleonic period when the Bourbon court was forced to escape from Naples and set up its royal court in Palermo with the assistance of the English navy. The Sicilian nobles were able to take the opportunity to force on the Bourbons a new constitution for Sicily that was based on the Westminster system of parliamentary government, and was in fact quite a liberal constitution for the time. However, post Congress of Vienna, Ferdinand IV of Naples (and III of Sicily) immediately abolished the constitution upon returning the royal court to Naples. The 1848 revolution was substantially organized from, and centered in, Palermo. The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred. The rebels are storming key cities and caught up the forces of our country off guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC441266;\n\nIn 1820, the American Colonization Society (ACS) began sending African American volunteers to the Pepper Coast to establish a colony for freed African Americans. The ACS, a private organization supported by prominent American politicians such as Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, and James Monroe, believed repatriation was preferable to emancipation of slaves, and they founded a colony on what is known as Liberia. The colony of Liberia was poor and economically dependent on the ACS, resulting that by the 1840s, the ACS was effectively bankrupt: Liberia had become a financial burden for it. When the American Colonization Society intimated that Liberia should cease its dependency on it, Joseph Roberts, the colony first black governor, proclaimed it an independent republic in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The natives of Bahr el Ghazal paid tribute to Darfur, and these were the chief articles of merchandise sold by the Darfurians to the Egyptian traders along the road to Asyut. Al-Zubayr redirected this flow of goods to Khartoum and the Nile with his conquest of South Sudan.

Al-Zubayr was a merchant from Khartoum, who hired his own private army and marched south. He set up a network of trading forts known as zaribas through the region, and from these forts controlled local trade.

So large was its perceived impact on the growing national consciousness over the issue of slavery that Abraham Lincoln, upon meeting Stove at the start of the Civil War, is reported as having greeted her: 'So this is the little lady who made this big war.' The publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin has increased national consciousness over the slavery issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97683;\n\nAfter the defeat of the forces of the Tokugawa Shogunate in the Boshin War, a part of the former Shogun's navy led by Admiral Enomoto Takeaki fled to the northern island of Ezo, together with several thousand soldiers and a handful of French military advisors and their leader, Jules Brunet. On $YEAR$, the independent "Republic of Ezo" was proclaimed, with a government organization based on that of the United States. Elections were based on universal suffrage among the samurai class. This was the first election ever held in Japan, where a feudal structure under an emperor with military warlords was the norm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98641;The Fate of the Zaydi Imamate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98641;\n\nThe Imams of Yemen are religiously consecrated leaders belonging to the Zaidiyyah branch of Shia Islam. They established a blend of religious and secular rule in parts of Yemen in 897 and now the Rassid dynasty ruled for almost a millennium. However, the power of the imamate declined in the 18th and 19th century. The territory controlled by the imams shrank successively after the late 17th century, and the lucrative coffee trade declined with new producers in other parts of the world. The imamate became a "quasi-state" with an inherent tension between tribes and government, and between tribal culture and learned Islamic morality. The imams themselves adopted the style of Middle East monarchies, becoming increasingly distant figures. As a result, they lost their charismatic and spiritual position among the tribes of Yemen. These recent developments made this the ideal moment to reassert our dominance over the highlands of Yemen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME500059;The Swiss Partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC500059;\n\nAs the Swiss state has been wiped off the map of Europe, its various ethnic groups have become divided in the absence of the former confederation. With Italians in the South, French in the West and Germans in the North, Switzerland seems well-suited to being partitioned. To this end, $FROMCOUNTRY$, which recently annexed the whole of Switzerland, has approached us with an offer: They would be willing to cede us lands populated mostly by speakers of our language. By agreeing to this deal, we would damage our reputation by giving tacit approval to $FROMCOUNTRY$'s violation of Swiss neutrality. Do we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC13021;\n\nWe have received reports that a number of our missionaries have been executed in $FROMCOUNTRY$, part of a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ action to round up all unwanted foreigners. The missionaries were peaceful, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public is understandably enraged. Many believe that war is necessary, while others believe the potential for war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ simply isn't worth it.

EVTDESC13031;\n\nA group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who left $COUNTRY$ some time ago on an expedition to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been viciously refused entry to the country. It appears that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has turned gradually to a policy of increasing isolationism, most likely in order to avoid the pains of modernizing their political, economical and social institutions. This policy of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is, obviously, impairing the advances of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ trade, diplomacy and missionary activities in the region, and must be considered an unjust restriction of the international freedom of movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME13051;Smugglers Dodge Trade Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13051;\n\nDue to the trade restrictions on the sale of opium, a number of western merchants have instead gone underground. We have word that a group of them have set up shop in one of our coastal provinces, but so far none of the locals seem willing to come forth with information. If we allow the smuggling ring to remain, it seems only a matter of time before the opium problem spreads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT13051OPTA;Ignore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT13051OPTB;Do whatever it takes to uproot them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13061;\n\nThe use of opium in a neighboring province has now spread to the inland. Farmers and laborers throughout $STATENAME$ fail to turn up for work, and entire fields fall fallow, as the people slip further and further down into the mists of consuming dependence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13185;An Invitation Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13185;\n\nA group of western expatriates currently residing in $CAPITAL$ have offered an invitation to high-ranking members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to attend a fancy affair in the legation quarter. We're well aware that this is just an excuse for these men to gain more influence in $COUNTRY$ -- but there could be benefits for us as well, namely using the opportunity to gain insight into their methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC13186;\n\nA group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ entrepreneurs recently spent time plying $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials with fine wine and favors at a formal affair in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s legation quarter. The result is promising -- a number of new business ventures and trade deals, giving $COUNTRY$ greater sway over $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ affairs. All these men require is our government's support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13220;\n\nSeveral of the Great Powers have in the past few years sought to establish formalized and permanent embassies in $COUNTRYNAME$, but up until now we've turned down their proposals. However, an idea has been floating around the capital that we should perhaps allow them to set up these embassies after all, provided they are all kept in one place where we can exact some amount of control over them. Perhaps a Legation Quarter in $CAPITAL$ could be just the thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT13186OPTA;We'll gladly support this initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT13186OPTB;They have our permission to continue, but we can offer no support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT13186OPTC;This is not in our best interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13202;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13202;\n\nOur relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have worsened to the point that members of their government have begun a campaign to reduce or even eliminate $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence. Some of our diplomats have fled, and now we are faced with the unpleasant prospect of either enforcing our interests or suffering embarrassment at our inability to manage a former ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13240_NEW;The oil lamp flickered, casting an orange, sooty glow across the moist brown of the cargo hold. The average ship docking in $COUNTRY$ carried very little to raise an eyebrow, but years of being fooled and fooled again by foreign merchants, trying to dodge some excise or other, had left him with a sixth sense for when things were out of order. A rat scurrying between some crates tipped him off. A sweet, pungent scent too familiar not to be alluring. Opium. A cargo hold full of opium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME37711;The First Carlist War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37711;\n\nThe death of King Ferdinand in 1833 and the ascension of young Isabela (only three years old at the time) to the throne of Spain sparked a revolt by supporters of the King's brother, the Infante Carlos.

EVTDESC37716;\n\nThe capital has been overrun, the pretender king driven into the provinces, and the original royal line descending from Ferdinand VII has been restored to the Spanish throne.

EVTDESC37720;\n\nThe death of General Leopoldo O'Donnell has eroded Queen Isabella's support, to the point where a movement to overthrow her has rapidly developed. A mutiny by naval officers in Cádiz has provided the spark for a widespread revolt against Isabella's rule. Her chief minister and generals have deserted her, and Isabella has been forced to flee into exile. For the moment, Spain stands without a ruler, and a provisional government has been formed, chaired by General Serrano of the conservative Liberal Union Party and with General Prim of the liberal Progressive Party as Minister of War. The Democratic Party has split, with some members, the 'Cimbrians', joining the Progressive Party in advocating for the establishment of a democratic monarchy.

The Constitution consists of 112 articles and two transitional provisions. Its preamble proclaims national sovereignty, individual rights and collective freedoms. These include freedom of assembly, freedom of association, universal male suffrage, freedom of the press and freedom of religion. The constitution also establishes a division of powers: The legislative branch in the form of the Cortes Generales, the executive with a soon-to-be determined king and the judiciary branch. The provisional government is tasked with deciding on a king to take the throne of Spain in the near future.

EVTNAME46605;The Argentine Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46605;\n\nUnrest is stirring against the Rosas dictatorship in Argentina, with liberals demanding a constitution and a transition to democratic rule. Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and asked us to support an uprising should Rosas refuse the liberal demands. The help we would give would be to install a democratic government in Argentina, not to support a free Entre-Rios.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT46605A;We will support the uprising when it comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT46605B;We cannot offer aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46610;The Constitutional Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46610;\n\nIt is the will of the entrerriano people to resume the exercise of the powers inherent in its territorial sovereignty and currently delegated to His Excellency the Governor and Captain General of Buenos Aires, for the cultivation of external relations and general direction of peace and war of the Argentine Confederation, under the quadrilateral treaty of the coastal provinces dated January 4, 1831. Until now, the governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, had all the government power and exercised all external relations for the Confederation. Each year he presented his resignation, knowing it would be rejected. Urquiza's statement was the effective acceptance of the resignation of Rosas by the Province of Entre Rios, who was resuming its ability to conduct its trade and external relations with other nations until such constitution of a republic was formalized. Neighboring governments might support Urquiza, and should he rise up in rebellion, they will intervene on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT46610A;We welcome the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME46611;The Argentine Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46611;\n\nWith Rosas unable to defeat the Entre Rios rebellion, General Urquiza has assumed temporary control of the government. Meeting with liberals in Santa Fe, they have drawn up a new constitution to the Argentine Constitution. The province of Buenos Aires is displeased and vows to resist while the former Governor and President, Juan Manuel de Rosas, was forced to flee the country and is now exiled in the United Kingdom. Bartolome Mitre assumed Buenos Aires in his stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA46611;Long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46612;Rosas is Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46612;\n\nThe rebellion in the provinces of the Argentine confederation have been put down, and both General Urquiza and his supporters have been captured and executed. The Argentine provinces have submitted to the will of Buenos Aires, and Rosas reigns supreme, the sole judge on the fate of Argentina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT46612A;Unite Argentina!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT46612B;Let's continue as a Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4661001;Rosas Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661001;\n\nThe governor of Buenos Aires and president of the Confederation, Juan Manuel de Rosas, refused our constitutional demand. Furthermore, he denied we have the right to conduct external relations ourselves and warned that any attempt to do so will be seen as rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT4661001A;Take control of Corrientes. Declare war on Rosas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT4661001B;There is no option but submit to his will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661002;\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederation armies, General Urquiza took control of the government, marching triumphant into Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME4661003;The National Organization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661003;\n\nWith the defeat of the enemies of Buenos Aires, a call for a new country order in Argentina begins. The future of Argentina lays in the hands of the victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME4661005;King Rosas the First;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661005;\n\nToday, on the year of our Lord $YEAR$, Juan Manuel de Rosas, the Restorer of the Laws, was declared Protector of Argentina and Restorer of the Order, as the king Juan Manuel de Rosas I, the first of the Rosas dynasty, first king of the Argentine Monarchy. Long live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME4661004;Corrientes and Entre-Rios;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661004;The provinces of Corrientes and Entre-Rios long have been close. Now, with the rebellion of Corrientes and our conquest of the province, the governor of Entre Rios made several political moves that brought the province under his influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME4661010;Paraguay Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661010;\n\nThe Congress of Paraguay formulated and declared an unilateral declaration of independence from the Argentine Confederation. While the provinces long had self rule, they were nominally part of our country and as such we have claims over it. Or we had, until they declared their independence from the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME4661011;Argentina Reunited;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661011;\n\nAfter years of strife and secession, Argentina is finally reunited. We must decide once and for all whether to be a confederal or federal state. Argentina's future hangs in the balance, as our decision will decide our destiny forevermore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME4661012;Negotiations with the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661012;\n\nOur country has been torn for too long. There's even talk by some Portenos that we should make our independence official and become forever separated from the Confederation.\n\nPresident Urquiza of the Argentine Confederation approached the government of Buenos Aires and offers to reunite the country by making some amendments in the constitution to benefit us, but the Portenos aren't happy with only these and threaten to become rebellious in case we accept Urquiza's offer. In the other hand, Urquiza and the Confederation threaten to force us to accept the new constitution in case this secession goes on for too long. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT4661012PTA;We will have the country united OUR way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT4661012PTB;We don't accept the constitution, but don't take action right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT4661012PTC;Accept the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4661013;The Confederation is Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661013;\n\nRecent battles have crushed the Confederation Army, and the forces of Buenos Aires advanced quickly replacing the government officials by ones loyal to Buenos Aires. The Civil War is over, Buenos Aires is triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT4661013PTA;A country reunited! §BPlay as the Argentine Confederation§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700013;\n\nThe Congress of Paraguay formulated and declared an unilateral declaration of independence from the Argentine Confederation. While the provinces long had self rule, they were nominally part of Argentina. Now with the formalization of their independence, the Paraguayan government is asking from an official recognition from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME700014;The Death of Carlos Lopez;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC700014;\n\nIn the year $YEAR$, Carlos López, President of Paraguay, died. His son, Francisco Solano López, called a congress that unanimously chose him as president for ten years. Solano López, born in the capital, was made Brigadier General of the Paraguayan Army by his father at the age of 18, in 1844, during the spasmodic hostilities then prevailing with Argentina. He was sent in 1853 as minister plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, and spent a year and a half in Europe. He purchased large quantities of arms and military supplies, together with several steamers, and organized a project for building a railroad and establishing a French colony in Paraguay. He also became infatuated with the empire of Napoleon III and with Napoleon Bonaparte himself. López equipped his army with exact copies of uniforms of Napoleonic army. He ordered for himself an exact replica of Napoleon's crown. Returning to Paraguay, he became Minister of War in 1855 and was appointed as Vice President by his father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT700014A;Long may he rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97666;The Rebellion is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97666;\n\nSaigo Takamori is dead -- some say he committed seppuku after receiving a wound -- and the rebellion he inspired is now ended. To many, this was the last gasp of the ancient samurai... and a new way for $COUNTRY$ on the path of progress now lies ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97666OPTA;Then it is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97680;The Sakhalin Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97680;\n\nJapan has quarreled with Russia before over the rule of Sakhalin Island. Now, our influence in China and Korea has led to renewed friction between our nations. The Line of Advantage dictates that we must extend our control over the whole of Sakhalin and establish a stronger northern border. But are we willing to risk war with a European power?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97680OPTA;Demand the island, or it is war! §RGain 5 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97680OPTB;This is not in our interests at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97681;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97681;\n\nThe warmongers in the Japanese government are now demanding that Russia cede Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands entirely to them. To give up so much territory without a fight would make us look very weak, but Japan's might has grown tremendously in recent decades. Can we risk a war in the Pacific?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97681OPTA;The islands aren't worth a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97681OPTB;Of course we will fight for the motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97676;War With $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97676;\n\nBelieving $COUNTRY$ to be weak, the hated Japanese have decided to strike at us and take control of our government. They shall find us a difficult target!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97676OPTA;We shall resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97677;The Korean Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97677;\n\nOur nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighboring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamoring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97677OPTA;We should take advantage while we can. §RGain 5 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97677OPTB;This is not in our best interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97678;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97678;\n\nThe recent murder of Ryukyuan sailors off the coast of Formosa in the Mudan Incident of 1871 has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? While the situation is long resolved, it still demonstrates that China's lack of control of the island's aboriginals is dangerous, giving us a pretext. The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97678OPTA;Demand the island, or it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97678OPTB;This is not in our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97679;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97679;\n\nAfter the recent murders of a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sailors off the coast of Formosa, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has delivered a demand: turn over the island, for the sake of their security, or it shall be war between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$. We know this is just an excuse for their militarist expansion... but can we stand up against their might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97679OPTA;We cannot fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97679OPTB;This insult cannot be borne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97627;\n\nThe Shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the Shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, yet the Shogunate refuses to compromise with the imperial court. Many are certain this will only speed up the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97627OPTA;This is most unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97630;The Death of Emperor Komei;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97630;\n\nOsahito, now posthumously known as Emperor Komei, has died of smallpox, which has come to a surprise to many, as he had never been ill before. There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated -- delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court. No matter the truth, the death of the Emperor has placed the young Mutsuhito upon the imperial throne and eliminated any chance of compromise.\n\nIndeed, Emperor Komei's vocal disapproval of the Satsuma and Choshu domains had prevented them from rallying support against the Shogun. The ambitious Emperor Mutsuhito, on the other hand, has expressed support for the tozama daimyo, hoping to use them to supplant the Shogun and become more than just the ceremonial ruler of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97630OPTA;We welcome the new emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97635;Opposition to the Bakufu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97635;\n\nThere is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa Shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. Officials within the bakufu are urging that we seek allies among either the outsider tozama or the traditional fudai, to strengthen the Shogunate's position. Approaching one means angering the other, of course, but it appears we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97635OPTA;We will seek allies among the southern tozama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97635OPTB;We will seek allies among the northern fudai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97636;\n\nThere is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa Shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. We have received word that the Shogunate has consulted with the outsider tozama, perhaps seeking new allies. If so, this compounds injury with insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97636OPTA;Perhaps it is time for a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97637;\n\nThere is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa Shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. We have received word that the Shogunate has consulted with the fudai daimyo, perhaps seeking new allies. This is hardly unexpected, though the tozama agree this makes it clear that the Shogunate is not the future of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97637OPTA;Perhaps it is time for a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97640;The Meiji Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97640;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over all of Japan. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ must make a decision: do we throw in our support with the imperial court, or do we uphold our duty and support the Shogun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97640OPTA;We shall support the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97640OPTB;We shall support the Shogun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97641;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have seized control of the palace at Kyoto and declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over Japan. Word has it they have recruited fellow daimyo to stand with them in this traitorous war. We must issue a call to our allies and move at once!\n\n §RNOTE: To win this war, you must occupy Kyoto and the rebellion leader's capital. You must not allow Edo to become occupied, and you cannot White Peace. If you White Peace, you lose.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97641OPTA;The Emperor steps beyond his place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97642;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over all of Japan. We have little choice, as they have forced our hand. Either we rise up against the Shogun now, or the Shogun will assume we are behind the rebellion even if we are not. The time has come to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97642OPTA;Then fight we shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97645;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97645;\n\nThe Edo palace has been occupied, and our loyal daimyo are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Emperor his victory. There is a place for the Tokugawa within the new order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97645OPTA;The Boshin War is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97646;The Meiji Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97646;\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan forces have marched triumphantly into Edo, and the Tokugawa Shogunate has agreed to a permanent peace. For the first time since before the Sengoku, the Imperial Court now rules Japan once again. Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97646OPTA;A victory for all of Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97647;\n\nEmperor Mutsuhito has been restored to rule over Japan. An imperial messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our willing allegiance to the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97647OPTA;Of course we will comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97647OPTB;Never! We will fight to become the new Shogun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97648;A New Capital in the East?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97648;\n\nWhile Kyoto has long been the capital of Japan, and home to the Imperial Court, the city of Edo has become the de facto capital -- for centuries it has been the center of Shogunate power, as well as a cultural and administrative center. The Emperor will need to decide whether the court should move to Edo and create a new capital... or remain in Kyoto and revitalize it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97648OPTA;We will move the capital to Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97648OPTB;The capital shall remain in Kyoto.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97650;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97650;\n\nThe Imperial palace at Kyoto has been occupied, and our daimyo allies are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Shogun his victory. If we are fortunate, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan will not be wiped out by this unfortunate turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97650OPTA;The Boshin War is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97651;Tokugawa Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97651;\n\nTokugawa clan forces have marched triumphantly into Kyoto, and the traitor daimyos have agreed to a permanent peace. The Bakumatsu has ended with the Shogunate in control once again -- victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97651OPTA;A victory for all of Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97652;\n\nThe Tokugawa Shogunate has once again asserted control over Japan. A bakufu messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our submission to direct rule from Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97652OPTA;Of course we will comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97652OPTB;Never! We will fight on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97660;The Taisho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97660;\n\nWith the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97660OPTA;Support the Taisho Democracy movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97660OPTB;These demonstrations are disruptive and unwanted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97661;The Shogunate Westernizes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97661;\n\nA great change has taken place within the Tokugawa Shogunate, and now $COUNTRY$ must keep pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97661OPTA;Then change we must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97665;The Satsuma Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97665;\n\nA growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97670;The Northern Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97670;\n\nThe islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings on Hokkaido, and we must seek to claim these places before the Russians do so first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97665OPTA;This cannot be allowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97665OPTB;We cannot afford a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97670OPTA;We must claim the northern islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97673;The Path of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97673;\n\n$COUNTRY$ has followed a militaristic path until now, determined to set ourselves against our neighbors in the interest of security -- while risking that security with dangerous wars. The new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has determined that this must change. We must follow a path of progress, and instead devote ourselves to technology and westernization if we are to remain free and whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97673OPTA;So shall it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97674;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97674;\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe. We now see this is in error, and that only by an aggressive expansion of our borders can we hope to maintain the security of $COUNTRY$ proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97674OPTA;So shall it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97675;China in Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97675;\n\nThe Chinese have fallen into warring factions, all but crumbling their power and leaving us an advantage we would be fools not to exploit. The Line of Advantage policy dictates that we should strike, and strike soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97675OPTA;We should take advantage while we can. §RGain 3 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97675OPTB;This is not in our best interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97600;Sakoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97600;\n\nMeaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa Shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97600OPTA;This is the proper way for Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97601;Rangaku;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima. Despite the enforced isolation of the nation, this policy of learning allowed western influences to spread -- particularly in the southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97601OPTA;To resist the westerners, we must learn their ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21130;The Great Tenpo Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21130;\n\nFrom 1833 to 1837, the Tenpo Famine ravaged Japan. Caused by cold weather and flooding from heavy rain, approximately 1 million Japanese had perished by 1837, comparable in fatalities to the Tenmei famine of 1781 to 1789.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21130OPTA;May the next bountiful harvest come soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21131;The End of the Great Tenpo Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21131;\n\nA combination of government intervention and better weather has led to a more adequate food supply. The Tenpo Famine is at its end. People celebrate by eagerly toiling to reap local harvests and visiting shrines to pay respects to Inari, the fox-god of rice and general prosperity, whom we are indebted to for helping us recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;
TOZAMADAIMYO;\n\nThe daimyo, Japanese feudal lords, have ruled most of Japan since the 10th century. During the Sengoku Jidai or Warring States Period, these daimyo vied for power over the Japanese archipelago. This period of disunity and infighting came to an end in 1600 when Tokugawa Ieyasu secured dominance over all of Japan in the Battle of Sekigahara, thus founding the Tokugawa Shogunate.\nIn the following national reorganization, those who were allies of Ieyasu's in the battle were made into fudai daimyo, and those who were neutral or his enemies were designated as tozama daimyo. We tozama, located in southwestern Japan, face constant discrimination and mistrust from the Shogun and his court and are excluded from the government. The tozama daimyo are the So clan of the Tsushima domain, the Shimazu clan of the Satsuma domain, the Mori clan of the Choshu domain, the Yamauchi clan of the Tosa domain and the Maeda clan of the Kaga domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;
FUDAIDAIMYO;\n\nThe daimyo, Japanese feudal lords, have ruled most of Japan since the 10th century.

We fudai, located in northeastern Japan, are held in higher regard than the tozama and receive all the important positions in the Shogun's government. The fudai daimyo are the Sakai clan of the Obama domain, the Uesugi clan of the Yonezawa domain, the Date clan of the Sendai domain and the Matsumae clan of the homonymous domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT21136OPTA;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21137;Japan Rejects the Treaty of Amity and Commerce;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21137;\n\nJapan has rejected our trade concession demands. They realize they are vulnerable to war with us should they say so, and they have risked it anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT21137OPTB;This isn't worth our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21138;Formation of the Shinsengumi;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21138;\n\nThe Shogun is besieged by disloyalty among the daimyos. The increasing threat to Japan's sovereignty by foreign powers has caused some domains to plot to overthrow the Shogun and replace him with the Emperor. In response, the Shogun created a special police force, the Roshigumi, comprised of ronin who were to patrol Kyoto and deal with traitors--only to then be disbanded after their leader was discovered to be a sympathizer with the Emperor. However, the force was soon reformed and renamed the Shinsengumi--and they are ready for blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21138OPTA;This is our ace in the hole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21139;Shinsengumi Patrols Arrive;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21139;\n\nThe Shogun has dispatched an elite police force known as the Shinsengumi to Kyoto in order to deal with pro-Imperial activity. They have recently been reorganized after it was found that their former leader, Kiyokawa Hachiro, was an Imperial sympathizer. The new force is masterful in warfare and brutal in their tactics. They mean to strike terror in the hearts of anyone who opposes the Shogun.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21139OPTA;We will retaliate soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21140;We have Crushed the Shinsengumi;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21140;\n\nOur forces have seized the upper hand in this war, leaving the Shogun with fewer and fewer good men to fight with. It was only a matter of time before a decisive battle would come between us and the Shogun's dreaded special forces group, the Shinsengumi. That decisive battle came to us in the town of Katsunuma. The crushing defeat forced commander Kondo Isami and the survivors to regroup in Edo for further orders. We are sure this loss will be a huge blow to the Shogunate's morale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21140OPTA;A devastating blow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;`
EVTNAME21141;The Shinsengumi Crushed in Battle;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21141;\n\nImperial forces have seized the upper hand in this war, and even our best men are struggling to defend from them. The Shinsengumi fought bravely, but a decisive battle in Katsunuma has left all but a handful of its members surviving. Kondo Isami, the Shinsengumi commander, has retreated with the survivors to Edo to await further orders. Their defeat brings increasing uncertainty to the Shogun's war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21141OPTA;A terrible loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21142;"Ee ja nai ka?";;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21142;\n\nLocal commoners weary of unrest and political intrigue have begun venting their frustrations through elaborate public protest dances, often related to rain magic and communication with spirits. Referred to as the "Ee ja nai ka" dances, the phrase "Ee ja nai ka" translates roughly to "so what?" This name encapsulates the abandon with which the dances take place, loudly parading through streets and often devolving into riots. Even if they are not explicitly anti-government protests, they have caused a disturbance to public order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21142OPTA;We will punish them if they step out of line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21143;The Morrison Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21143;\n\nA kurofune, or 'black ship,'from the West arrived at Edo Bay. This vessel, the SS Morrison, belonged to the American merchant fleet, carrying 7 Japanese castaways picked up from Macau and expected to be repatriated upon arrival, as well as Christian missionaries. It was completely unarmed, so as to signify peaceful intent. However, due to the 1825 Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels, Shogunate forces were obligated to fire upon the ship with shore batteries. It then circled around to the foreigner-friendly port in Nagasaki to repatriate the 2 of the 7 castaways. Overnight, the boat stayed in port, while our forces moved cannons around it to attack it again once it disembarked the following morning. This confrontation has the potential to provoke the United States, as well as all of the West, to take punitive action.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21143OPTA;We stand by our military's actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21143OPTB;This was a terrible misunderstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21144;The Morrison Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21144;\n\nOne of our merchant vessels, the SS Morrison, has attempted to dock in Japan's Edo Bay. The fleet was entirely unarmed and carried 7 Japanese castaways that the captain intended to repatriate, as well as Christian missionaries. Because no foreign vessels are allowed into any Japanese port aside from Dejima, in Nagasaki, Japanese forces attacked the ship on sight. The SS Morrison was only able to repatriate 2 of the castaways after circling over to Dejima, after which it was fired upon again. The Japanese government has not signalled an intention to apologize or compensate the captain.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21144OPTA;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21144OPTB;We were wrong not to be more careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME21146;The Otsu Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21146;\n\nJapan experienced an unexpected diplomatic visit by Russian prince Nicholas Alexandrovich, who arrived after traveling to the Russian Far East to attend the Trans-Siberian Railway's opening ceremony. He was touring Lake Biwa, in Otsu, Shiga Prefecture, carried by rickshaw--when a rogue police officer made an attempt on his life with a sword. The blow narrowly missed Nicholas's face and was parried by Prince George of Greece and Denmark. In the aftermath, Nicholas was visited by the Emperor himself, who apologized almost more profusely than humanly possible and promised the execution of the attacker. The attacker, Tsuda Sanzo, claimed his motive was that he thought Nicholas was a Russian spy. Tsuda was summarily beheaded.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21146OPTA;The perpetrator deserved all he got.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC21148;\n\nAfter attending the opening ceremony of the Trans-Siberian Railway, prince Nikolay Alexandrovich made a surprise visit to Japan. At the town of Otsu, however, an attempt was made on his life by a rogue police officer, Tsuda Sanzo, who attacked him with a sword. He would later claim his motive was he mistook Nikolay for a Russian spy. The blow narrowly missed the Tsesarevich's face and was parried by Prince George of Greece and Denmark, accompanying him there. The disaster resulted in Japan's head of state personally coming to speak with the Tsesarevich. He profusely apologized and promised a summary execution of the perpetrator. Almost needless to say, this has led to a crisis in diplomatic relations with Japan, even if they served justice to the assassin.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT21148OPTA;We will eventually forgive them. Eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97605;Kurofune;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97605;\n\nMore 'black ships' have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sakoku -- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97605OPTA;We have little choice but to agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97605OPTB;Never! We will fight the Americans if we must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97606;Commodore Perry Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97606;\n\nCommodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan's policy of isolation. This is a great coup for American diplomacy and influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97606OPTA;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97607;The Japanese Are Defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97607;\n\nCommodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with unfortunate news: they have chosen to defy his ultimatum and thumb their collective noses at our government. Should we back down now, it will be a great blow to our prestige and our influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97609;\n\nWe have formally concluded a treaty with the Japanese which will see our influence restored, and our demands for their ports to be opened to our ships to be met. Additionally, an indemnity will be placed upon their government to make up for the expense of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97609OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97615;Sonno Joi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97615;\n\n'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!' \n \n This is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa Shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen, but also against the Shogunate itself. Each incident chips away at Tokugawa control over the daimyo and erodes relations with the western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97617;Order to Expel the Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97617;\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan.

EVT97617OPTA;A dangerous and reckless act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97618;\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, and is a challenge to the Shogunate's power.

EVTNAME97620;The Death of Iesada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97620;\n\nTokugawa Iesada, the 13th Shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become Shogun, while the fudai daimyo and Shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi -- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97620OPTA;We will support the tozama and make Yoshinobu Shogun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97620OPTB;The fudai are Tokugawa allies. Iemochi will be Shogun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97621;Tokugawa Yoshinobu is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97621;\n\nThe Shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the Shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97622;\n\nEven though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new Shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97623;Tokugawa Iemochi is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97623;\n\nPandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed Shogun -- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama. It is becoming increasingly clear that a larger change is necessary. Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97623OPTA;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97624;\n\nThe Shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the fudai daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the outsider tozama will have their influence in the bakufu kept to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97624OPTA;A good sign indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97625;Sakuradamon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97625;\n\nThe Shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the Shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point. Many are urging that a policy of Kobu Gattai -- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court -- may be required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97625OPTA;A compromise is clearly required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97625OPTB;No! There will be no compromise with traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC10140_NEW;\n\nLiberal causes have started to gain traction in $COUNTRY$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society, forced into hiding due to the persecution of any legitimate opposition to the ruling party. Whether it be the Rosicrucian's or the Illuminati, these society members will continue to act from the shadows until $COUNTRY$ allows free debate and opposition in its politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10150_NEW;\n\nThe smog from the factories hangs low against the blood red of a charcoal sky. Far away in the depths of the city, in the deepest bowels of the industrial machine, the cries and shouts of a forming mob can be heard echoing against a backdrop of drainpipes and smokestacks.

EVTNAME10155;Pan-Nationalist Fervor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10155;\n\nA fervor has been sweeping through parts of $COUNTRY$, with liberal-minded revolutionaries calling for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens to rise up and demand the unification of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$.

The 'true' American government has decreed this the act of traitors, and already is assembling its military to crush the northern secessionists. The so-called Free American government, however, is calling on patriots to rebel against a government held hostage to southern aristocrats and hidebound thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT16510OPTA;We support the Free Americans! §BPlay as the FSA§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT16510OPTB;The rebels shall be dealt with swiftly and mercilessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16515;The Union Sundered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16515;\n\nThe civil war is over... and we have lost. The United States of America that was is now gone. Delegates in $CAPITAL$ have convened to urge the government to put aside the former constitution, declaring it irrelevant for the reality that now faces us. A new constitution is being drafted, one heralding our place as master of the South, though there are yet some who say our destiny must one day be retaken and that not all is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT16515OPTA;All of America will be retaken. We swear it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97550;The Federal Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97550;\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America has been chaotic since its inception. Liberals who had high hopes for the union are in constant battle with conservatives, in particular the clergy and wealthy landowners, and there is a general fear of domination by Guatemala and resentment of the rule of the liberal elites in El Salvador. At this point, the struggle to maintain the union seems like an almost impossible one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97551;Costa Rica Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97551;With rebels in Nicaragua having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in southern Costa Rica.

EVTNAME97560;End of the Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97560;\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America is rapidly disintegrating. Members of the government have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss whether the union should be officially dissolved and the state of El Salvador declared, or whether we should fight to preserve what we have. Some consider that to be an impossible task, though liberals argue that we should not allow conservatives doom the region to a future of division and internal squabbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97560OPTA;We will continue fighting to preserve the republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97560OPTB;The republic must end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32550;The Belize Purchase?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44125;Mexico is not properly utilizing the lands between ours and the Pacific.

EVTNAME44126;The $FROMCOUNTRY$ want California!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44126;\n\nThe American ambassador has informed us that it would be in our best interests to sell the lands north of the Rio Grande to the United States.

EVTDESC44150;\n\nAs American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Oregon Country. The entire region west of the Rockies (called Columbia by the British) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. British claims stretch all the way south to the 42nd Parallel while American claims reach north to the 54th Parallel. But the British claim they are willing to compromise and have been pushing for an established border along the Columbia River which they believe would be a fair solution and help both nations avoid another costly war. It's clearly a tense situation, and the specter of war with the British looms as politicians in the current election campaign are banging the drums of Manifest Destiny in order to gain support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44153;Oregon Negotiations Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44153;\n\nThe talks with the British have broken down, primarily due to the continuing calls by warmongering politicians.

Recently the situation has been exacerbated by American politicians rattling their sabers over their idea of 'Manifest Destiny', and they have pressed their claim all the way north to the 54th Parallel. It will almost certainly mean war, and our only consideration should probably be whether we wish to pursue another costly war with the Americans in North America when our time could better be spent elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44805;\n\nA general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833. After deposing his liberal vice-president, Santa Anna abrogated the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with both church and military backing.

EVTNAME44820;The Republic of the Rio Grande;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44820;\n\nInspired by the success of the Texas rebellion against the centralist government, federalist malcontents in the territories along the Rio Grande have risen up and declared their independence from Mexico with covert support from Texas. Their flag has three stars, representing Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas, the three rebellious states. Jesús de Cárdenas, a former lawyer and political chief of the northern department of Tamaulipas has been sworn in as president of the new republic. The new government has already begun issuing its own newspaper, named 'Correo del Rio Bravo del Norte'. Their motto is 'Dios, Libertad y Convención', or 'God, Liberty and Convention'. Antonio Canales Rosillo, a local officer, has been appointed commander-in-chief of the rebel army, and is beginning to gather his forces to face the unitarian army in spite of the odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44821;The Yucatan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44821;\n\nAngered by the abrogation of the 1824 Constitution and the centralization of government power in Mexico City, liberals in the Yucatan have declared their independence. The disloyal federal army of Yucatán has joined the ranks of the rebels, quickly seizing the key cities of Mérida, Valladolid and Campeche. They have even created their own constitution, cementing freedom of religion, juries in courts and compulsory military service within the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44822;Join the United Provinces?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44835;\n\nPorfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup.

EVTDESC44840;\n\nIn a surprise development, the leader of Mexico -- General Antonio de Santa Anna himself -- has been captured. Found running through the countryside, attempting to escape back to Mexico, he has been imprisoned in a Texan jail and forced to negotiate. We can force the man to agree to a peace treaty -- even though many consider the odds of Santa Anna's own country agreeing to terms exacted under duress to be slight, it may be our only hope against overwhelming odds. At the very least, the humiliation dealt against their leader will be a blow against the Mexican government and one from which they will not soon recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44840OPTA;Force him to sign the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44841;\n\nIn a humiliating blow to Mexico's prestige, General Santa Anna has been captured within Texan territory -- separated from our army and found wandering the countryside in an attempt to return to Mexico. While imprisoned, he agreed to a series of treaties which recognized Texan independence among other guarantees... all in exchange for his safe return. We are now faced with a question: while the treaties are worthless, disregarding them completely could give the Americans a cause to intervene. Either way, one thing is certain: as the architect of this fiasco, Santa Anna's time in power is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44842;\n\nWhile Mexico had every reason to refute the treaties signed by Santa Anna, it seems their willingness to continue the war against Texas has waned. They will not embarrass themselves further, and have agreed to let us remain free in exchange for Santa Anna's return. For the moment, this means the war with Mexico is over... whether that peace will continue remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44843;Ceasefire With Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44843;\n\nAs expected, the Mexican government has refuted the Treaties of Velasco and refused to negotiate for Santa Anna's return. They are, however, evidently afraid that the treaties have enough validity that ignoring them would give the Americans an excuse to intervene -- and have called for a ceasefire. How long it will last is unknown, but for the moment Texas has its respite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44843OPTA;This will have to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44844;Mexico Ignores the Treaties;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44844;\n\nNot unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco -- claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44844OPTA;Appeal to the Americans for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44845;War With Mexico!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44845;\n\nDespite the assurances supposedly offered by the Treaties of Velasco, we once again find ourselves at war with Mexico. The ceasefire is, it seems, now over. While many in our government never expected Mexico to live up to the terms of the treaties anyhow, they do suggest that this might be enough cause for the Americans to intervene. Such an intervention would, of course, be inviting the wolves through the front door - but do we have any other choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44846;The Texan Diplomat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44846;\n\nA diplomat has arrived in Washington from Texas -- a part of the Mexican frontier, settled by southerners who had been offered land by the Mexican government and who then rebelled against its tyranny. The diplomat has asked for American intervention in their war, claiming that a treaty had been worked out with Mexico which they then of course immediately refuted. It seems like shaky grounds, but do we turn our backs on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97170;The Mahdist Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97170;\n\nIn the troubled atmosphere of Sudan's modernization, Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a fakir and religious leader, has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one'). The son of a Dongola boat-builder, Muhammad Ahmad had become the disciple of Muhammad ash Sharif, the head of the Sammaniyah order. Now, combining personal magnetism with religious zealotry, he begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan, determined to expel us and restore Islam to its primitive purity. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism -- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat - especially if they capture Khartoum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97170OPTA;Khartoum may not fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98725;The Call for Arab Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98725;\n\nThe call has gone out across the world: a nation has risen to lead the Arab masses into the future, a greater power that can withstand the onslaught of colonialism by the European powers.

EVT98725OPTA;We will lead the Arab world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95260;The Disunited States;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95260;\n\nWith the end of the democratic government of the United States, there is a growing feeling among many Americans that the principles upon which the country were founded no longer apply. Talk of secession is frequent, if quiet, and as unrest begins to grow it's become increasingly more possible that liberal-minded states will attempt to pull out of the Union. If they do, we must be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95260OPTA;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95261;The Sons of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95261;\n\nA group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has secretly formed in $PROVINCENAME$, advocating either the overthrow of the totalitarian American regime or the secession of $STATENAME$ from the Union. American law-enforcement is doing its best to hunt down these traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC95265;\n\n'On this day in the year of our lord, $YEAR$, do we declare the Union to be defunct, a relic of the past now only a shadow of its former greatness. We delegates hereby declare ourselves the inheritors of that once-great legacy, and forever more shall we be known as the Free States of America.' \n \n With those words,delegates from several states in the north have gathered in Philadelphia and declared their secession from the Union. Whether we can move fast enough to ensure those states never act upon the declaration, or whether others will heed the call of these so-called 'Free States' remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

No longer can the South remain under the heel of the North and call it freedom -- the Confederacy must rise again!' \n \n With those words, a large group of delegates gathered in Richmond have declared the Confederate States of America reborn. At least one state has agreed to secede, and its possible that others will join them, now or very soon. If we are to stop this new rebellion, we will need to act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Oregon Country is a land where men achieve their destiny through honest toil and while believing in the equality of men. Since the Union no longer believes in the same, we hereby declare it dead.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Portland have declared the secession of Oregon from the Union. While other parts of the region may join them, it's unknown whether everyone there feels the same. Clearly this rebellion must be stopped before it gains further traction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

What they have put aside, we shall pick up and keep close to our hearts -- for now, a new nation is born. A republic that will stand the test of time as the nation we step away from has not.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathered in the city of Denver has declared the creation of the Colorado Republic. Whether more states will join their rebellion still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That is what we do here today: we are forging a new alliance of equals, brothers with a common heritage who will never forget the evils that lie in tyranny and corruption.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Chicago have declared the formation of a 'New American Alliance'. The state of Illinois has seceded from the Union to create it, and it's entirely possible that others will join them if we do not act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95274;\n\nA group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the New American Alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Washington government thought it could stretch its hand across the breadth of North America, that all they touched would bow down and be forever grateful for their overlordship. We say it is not so, and stand here today to proclaim that there is a better way.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathered in Rapid City have declared the formation of the 'Dakota Republic'. South Dakota has seceded from the Union, and it's possible that others may soon join them. Do they not realize how short-lived their rebellion will surely be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ours is a unique heritage, and we will move forward with the intention of celebrating it in the spirit of freedom and goodwill for all mankind.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathered in Phoenix have declared the formation of a 'Pueblo Republic'. Arizona and New Mexico have both seceded from the union to form it, daring us to stop their rebellion -- if we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They stand ready to resist any attempt by us to retake them through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95279;The Convention of San Francisco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95279;\n\n'Our joining of the Union was with the understanding that it meant something -- we were joining a cause for true freedom in a world full of totalitarianism, a cause far greater than any we could hope to achieve on our own. We were mistaken, and now we must march forward on our own terms.

EVTDESC36709;\n\nWhile Belgium's de facto independence from the Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian Revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure and we yet hold claims over Belgian territory.

EVTDESC36715;\n\nDespite our best efforts, the unthinkable has happened: Amsterdam has fallen. It seems there is little choice but to surrender to the Belgians and allow them to dictate terms. If they are kind, they will simply force us to relinquish all claims to the southern Netherlands. If they are unkind, they may force us to give up territory -- though doing so will surely bring about the wrath of the European powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For the moment, this is simply an idea, a suggestion that the Scandinavian nations should work together towards an eventual union. If we disagree, it's possible that the idea dies here. If we don't, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might be mortally insulted. If Scandinavians are to take their rightful place in Europe, however, perhaps there is merit in their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC32521;\n\nVice-Admiral Yevfimy Putiatin has sailed from Russia to $COUNTRY$ on a mission to establish formal relations and to define the borders between our respective territories. After negotiation, Russia has proposed a treaty that would open three ports, Hakodate, Shimoda and Nagasaki to Russian merchants and guarantee Russian ships access through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ waters and straits. Both sides would agree that our borders in the Kuril Islands lie just North of Etorofu, and we would share sovereignty over Sakhalin Island. Additionally, it would guarantee mutual extraterritoriality for citizens of Russia and of Japan in each other's country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. There are several solutions we could propose: first, we could officially divide the island between us and Japan, essentially legalizing the status quo. This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return. This would hurt our reputation, and it would badly offend the Japanese, who would probably refuse. How should our diplomats proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia. On the other hand, if we insist on the status quo, we will keep our present territory but risk escalating the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin. If we give in, we will lose a promising colony and look weak to other nations. But, if we insist on the status quo, the conflict is likely to escalate into open war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We can back down and accept the status quo, or we can use force to get our way. If we accept the status quo after reaching for more, we will look weak to the other Powers, though relations with Japan will be preserved. But, our only other option now is to declare aggressive war for the islands, which will hurt our reputation abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC20111;\n\nA recent riot in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought a great deal of attention to $STATENAME$ -- the kind that would normally prompt the great powers to consider intervention. It seems, however, that the demands for independence by 'uncivilized' peoples has largely fallen on deaf ears. News of the trouble has faded away as quickly as it began.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC20115;\n\nA demonstration by $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ quickly got out of hand as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shot into the crowd to disperse it. A riot ensued, and several protesters were slain. Throughout $STATENAME$, the reaction has been one of outrage -- and there is an effort by some $PROVINCECULTURE$ malcontents to draw the attention of the world, just one more example of $COUNTRY$'s disregard for peace and civilized behavior -- or so they'll say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME38505;Death of the Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC38505;\n\nThe death of Sa'id bin Sultan Al-Busaid has left him with two sons, each of which has claimed Oman as their own to rule. The result of this struggle has brought in foreign mediation, with the resulting decree that the nation will be split into two sultanates: one in Zanzibar and one in Muscat, each ruled by one of Al-Basaid's sons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC38500;\n\nSaid bin Sultan, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, ratified in 1835 a treaty with the United States on very favorable terms, that had been negotiated by Edmund Roberts at Muscat on September 21, 1833. The friendly relations with the Unites States and the Omani possessions in the Swahili Coast led Said bin Sultan to consider moving his capital from Muscat, Oman, to Stone Town, Zanzibar where Richard Waters is an American Consul. This move would allow $COUNTRY$ to try to further a trading relationship by sending a ship to the United States. Moving the capital, however, is bound to give some momentum to the rebellious tribes of Oman proper and give some munition to the rebellious Imam of Oman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97000;The Revolution of Maria da Fonte;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97000;\n\nA growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal's poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion -- which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters -- and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97003;The Emboscada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97003;\n\nSpurred on by the spreading revolts in Portugal, Queen Maria II has suspended the constitution and installed a reactionary government presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha. This has served to spur on the country's liberals to outrage, and begun talk of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97015;Regicide of King Carlos I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97015;\n\nUpon returning to Lisbon from a brief trip abroad, King Carlos I and the royal family had their carriage fired upon by republican activists as they passed through the Terreiro do Paço. Three of the bullets struck and killed the King, while another fatally wounded the heir to the throne, Luis Filipe. During the turmoil, the police killed the assassins... but the King and the royal heir were not saved and were pronounced dead at the Naval Arsenal soon afterwards. Manuel, the king's youngest son, has been quickly acclaimed as the new King of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97020;The Republican Coup D'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97020;\n\nWith the monarchy already weakened by the death of King Carlos, republican opponents have been able to gather considerable support in the capital. Members of the Carbonária, republican youth, and elements of the army have instigated a coup d'état in the palace. The young King Manuel and his family have reportedly escaped for exile to England, and only days later a new Portuguese Republic has been declared in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC98200;\n\nThe Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with $COUNTRY_ADJ$  rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the north-east, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent.

After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Orange River valley and established a new colony -- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98215OPTA;An interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98216;The Boers Overtake the Orange Valley;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98216;\n\nWe have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Orange Valley and declared it their own. This is an outrage... yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98216OPTA;There will be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98220;The Potchefstroom Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98220;\n\nThe Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Ndebele. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Transvaal and established a new colony -- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98221;The Boers Overtake the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98221;\n\nWe have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Transvaal and declared it their own. This is an outrage... yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98225;The Boer Exodus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98225;\n\nWith 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave $PROVINCENAME$ behind and travel to either the Transvaal or the Oranje Free State where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98225OPTA;Whoever wishes to go may leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98225OPTB;Give them incentives to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98227;The Dorsland Trek;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98227;\n\nWith 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave $PROVINCENAME$ behind and establish new homes outside of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. The Dorsland Trek (Thirstland Trek) was the collective name of a series of explorations undertaken by Boer settlers to South-West Africa rather than to the Orange Free State and the South African Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98230;Sand River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98230;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the 'unethical' treatment of foreigners working in our territory ('uitlanders', as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98230OPTA;We will abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98230OPTB;We will be independent on our own terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98231;Orange River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98235;\n\nMigrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Johannesburg', on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98236;Kimberley Gold Rush;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98236;\n\nGold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas -- who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98235OPTA;They are proving to be a nuisance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98240;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98240;\n\nThe time has come to consider joining the South African union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98240OPTA;This is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98241;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98241;\n\nWe have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98241OPTA;We will agree to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98241OPTB;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98245;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98245;\n\nOur colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrassing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98245OPTA;They will submit, or else! §RGain 3 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98245OPTB;We will not press the matter. §GLose 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98246;The Anglo-Boer War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98246;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98246OPTA;We fight with Transvaal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98246OPTB;Transvaal is on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98247;South Africa is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98247;\n\nThe Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Cape Town already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Boers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98247OPTA;Let us reconcile with the Boers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98247OPTB;Never! There will be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98248;The Treaty of Vereeniging;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98248;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone is one of reconciliation, and it is clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ wishes to build good relations with us after the business of this war is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98248OPTA;That's good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98249;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone of the talks has been very bitter, and it's clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government will do all it can to return and trouble us again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98249OPTA;We shall accept their surrender nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98250;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98250;\n\nThe Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMPONDO;\n\nThe Mpondo have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Mpondos, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98250OPTA;We have no choice. §RGain 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98250OPTB;Back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98255;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98255OPTA;This is beyond the pale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98256;\n\nWe have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98256OPTA;Then so must it be. §RGain 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98256OPTB;We will influence their government instead. §GLose 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98260;Walvis Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98260;\n\nOther European nations have an eye on the region of Namaqualand, directly to the north of our holdings in the Cape Colony. To forestall their ambitions, it has been recommended that we establish an enclave at Walvis Bay and incorporate it into our southern colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98260OPTA;A fine idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98260OPTB;It's not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98261;The Northern Cape Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98261;\n\nMany $COUNTRY_ADJ$ settlers are pushing north of the Cape Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government. We should consider increasing our presence in the region and establishing greater colonial government, before another country comes and claims it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98261OPTA;This is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98261OPTB;We have other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85000;Catholics Slain in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85000;\n\nThere has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux -- head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church -- and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessel which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea -- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85000OPTA;This cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85000OPTB;We cannot afford to escalate the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85001;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Retribution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85001;\n\nThe foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries -- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85001OPTA;The Koreans are on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85001OPTB;We will not abandon the Koreans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85002;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85002;\n\nOne of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$ -- which should have brought our Qing allies to our defense. Frustratingly, and perhaps not unexpectedly, the Qing have responded by severing their ties to $COUNTRY$ and abandoning us to our fate. War with the French seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85002OPTA;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85002OPTB;We must maintain good relations with the Qing, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85003;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85003;\n\nNot unexpectedly, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to abandon Korea to its fate in order to curry favor with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85003OPTA;Excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85004;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Will Defend $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85004;\n\nOne of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$ -- which has brought our Qing allies to bear. Instead of abandoning us, they have threatened war with the French should they intrude on our sovereignty. This may mean war with the French, but at least we know our allies remain strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85004OPTA;That is a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85005;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Will Defend Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85005;\n\nNegotiations with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have not gone well. They are determined to protect their Korean vassals, even if it means war with France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85005OPTA;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85005OPTB;We will not push the matter further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85010;The Ganghwa Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85010;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbor when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home -- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrespect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85010OPTA;Demand an apology as well as the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85010OPTB;This is not in our interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85011;\n\nA $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbor when it was fired on by the coastal fortress -- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation -- in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85011OPTA;There is nothing we can do. Sign the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85011OPTB;Never! Let them do their worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85012;\n\nA Japanese vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbor when it was fired on by the coastal fortress -- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, the Japanese ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle Korean forces on land. The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence... one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85012OPTA;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85013;\n\nThe Korean government has caved to our delegation and signed the Treaty of Ganghwa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85013OPTA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85014;\n\nThe Korean government has thumbed its nose at our delegation. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people cry out for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85014OPTA;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85015;Korean Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85015;\n\nWe are being overwhelmed by the superior might of Japanese armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated Japanese terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85015OPTA;It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85020;Tonghak Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85020;\n\nWith increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or 'Eastern Learning' ideology. They have been stirring up the peasant classes, forming poorly-armed if numerous armies to purge the capital and rid the country of Japanese and other foreign presence. We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighboring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85020OPTA;This cannot be allowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85021;Tonghak Rebellion Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85021;\n\nThe unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored -- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85025;\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea -- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85025OPTA;We must intervene in Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85025OPTB;They are on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85026;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Intervenes in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85026;\n\nWe have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese -- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85026OPTA;Overthrow the Korean government. §RGain 5 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85026OPTB;This is not the time to act. §GLose 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85027;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Forces Enter Seoul;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85027;\n\nReacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85027OPTA;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85027OPTB;Retreat to Pyongyang and prepare to strike back. §R(War)§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85028;\n\nResponding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85028OPTA;War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT85028OPTB;This is not the time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85029;Chinese Intervene in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85029;\n\nReacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea -- entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85030;\n\nThe rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act -- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98620;Christian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98620;The Ottoman government had a number of policies regarding the treatment of Christians within the Empire which were considered oppressive: the capitulation tax, known as the Jizya, as well as controls over Christians which did not permit them to become soldiers or hold public office. It was not until the Hatt-i Humayun in 1856 -- also known as the Imperial Reform Edict, part of the Tanzimat Reforms -- that things actually began to improve for minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98620OPTA;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98625;The Kanûn-i Esâsî;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98625;\n\nA group of liberal intellectuals known as the 'Young Ottomans', led by the statesman reformer Midhat Pasha and influenced by the Liberal Revolutions elsewhere in Europe, have proposed a new constitution -- the 'Kanûn-i Esâsî' or 'Basic Law' -- which would see an elected parliament created, would limit the powers of the Sultan, and speed up the Tanzimat Reforms. Conservative members of the Ottoman government claim that giving into these liberals will only speed up the erosion of long-held traditions, while others say that the reforms are sorely needed to stave off the decline of the Empire at the hands of nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98625OPTA;Tradition will be maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98625OPTB;Implement the reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98626;The Empire in Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98626;\n\nThe current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants -- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force -- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98626OPTA;Order must be restored. Abrogate the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98626OPTB;Reform must move forward, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98630;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98630;\n\nWith the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98630OPTA;This cannot be permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98635;The Young Turks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98635;\n\nSpurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the constitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98635OPTA;We cannot allow them to spread unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98635OPTB;Let them talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98636;Turkish Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98636;\n\nTurkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy -- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98636OPTA;This is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98640;End of the Ottoman Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98640;\n\nThe Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place. The concept of Ottomanism, an Empire formed of diverse cultures and religions, has been set aside in favor of a nation built by and for the Turkish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98640OPTA;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97500;Sovereign Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97500;\n\nThe French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97500OPTA;Russia protects the Holy Land, not France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97500OPTB;We will agree to the French demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97501;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Our Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97501;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97501OPTA;Pressure them into accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97501OPTB;Abandon our claim before this goes further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97502;French Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97502;\n\nThe French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97502OPTA;We must give in to the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97502OPTB;Never! Let them come, if they dare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97503;\n\nThe French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97503OPTA;We are the protectors of Eastern Christians, not the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97504;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places -- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97504OPTA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97505;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97505;\n\nThrough a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97505OPTA;This will surely lead to trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97506;\n\nIn what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97506OPTA;We intend to stay out of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97506OPTB;We will protect our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97507;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97507;\n\nRussia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet -- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97507OPTA;A dark day for the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97507OPTB;Never! There is still a chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97510;\n\nThe powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail) and that we will renounce our claims in the area. Other demands are that we cede the territory of the Åland Islands to Finland as demilitarized zone. Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME10400;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10400;\n\nThe unrest in France hit its height recently, with crowds streaming through the streets of Paris and erecting barricades. In what was widely regarded as an accident, a French guardsmen fired his musket on the citizens and set off a massacre. The resulting conflagration has swept the city, with crowds chanting 'Long live the Reform!' and 'Down with the King!'. Despite assurances that everything is under control, the king has abdicated and fled the country, leaving a provisional government to step in and declare the Second Republic. \n \n Now we have the task of building this new government, starting with a presidential election to determine its new Head of State. Considering the popularity of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte among the masses, and the granting of universal voting rights, some are say that he may in fact take the leadership. If he does, who knows what this may mean for France?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT10400OPTA;Liberté! Égalité! Fraternité!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10401;The Presidential Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10401;\n\nWhile it was expected that Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte would do well in the French presidential election, no one could have counted on the fact that he has done as well as this. Despite his autocratic leanings and lack of allies in Paris, he has managed to be something to everyone, even gaining the sponsorship of the Orleanists. The provisional government's candidate, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, led the effort to quell an uprising in the city -- leading to resentment among the masses which has translated into Napoleon's landslide. Many fear the man takes too much after his infamous uncle, and thus the idea has arisen of fixing the elections to ensure Cavaignac's victory. This would require us to restrict universal suffrage, as well as muffle the newspapers and political opponents. Either way, the ideals of the Second Republic seem at risk of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME10402;Napoleon Wins Election!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10402;\n\nLouis-Napoléon Bonaparte has swept into power as France's new Head of State. The man carries with him the legacy of his infamous uncle, and with it the support of the masses.

EVTNAME10405;Louis-Napoleon's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10405;\n\nUnable to force the Upper House to repeal its prohibition against presidential re-election and facing removal from power, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France. All around Europe, countries are reacting to the news negatively, fearing a revival of the old Napoleonic goals. Even in Russia the ruler refuses to recognize the new Napoleon as emperor on the grounds that 'emperors are made by God, not elected by referendum.';;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC10410;\n\nThe popularity of Louis-Napoleon has waned. Where once it was expected that his ascension would return France to the greatness it experienced during the reign of his uncle, instead France sees itself being eclipsed by its neighbors. The Emperor has cultivated many enemies among the liberals in Paris, and now they have chosen their moment to strike. Napoleon has been deposed, and the only question remains as to what form France shall now take. Shall we restore the Bourbon dynasty under the Count of Chambord, elect for a Bourbon constitutional monarchy under the Comte de Paris, or instead opt to create the Third Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mourned by the entire nation, and by his beloved Empress Eugénie, the question now turns to who will follow him. His son and heir would be Napoleon IV, but he is still a young man, eager to live up to the legacy left to him. Others favor the popular Bourbon Count of Paris. Still more, however, claim this is the perfect moment to restore the republic and end the monarchy once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1010011;The Great Irish Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010011;\n\nFor years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez-faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1010015;The Young Irelander Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010015;\n\nAn aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war... but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1010030;\n\nAn Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent -- able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed.

Either way, this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME90050;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII.

The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support.

EVTDESC900054;The secessionist movement of the large German majority in Holstein and southern Schleswig was suppressed in the First Schleswig War , but the movement continued throughout the 1850s and 1860s, as Denmark attempted to integrate the Duchy of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom whilst proponents of German unification expressed the wish to include the Danish-ruled duchies of Holstein and Schleswig in a Greater Germany.\n\nKing Christian IX of Denmark has signed the so-called "November constitution" establishing a shared law of succession and a common parliament for both Schleswig and Denmark. This is a direct violation of the London Protocol which ended the first Schlewsig War, the German Confederation must take action against the Danes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT90054OPTB;We can do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME900054;The Second Schleswig War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9000954;The situation in Schleswig is tense, but without fighting - Danish forces control the north bank of the Eider River and German forces the south bank. Austria and Prussia have declared furthermore to take action against Denmark without regard to decisions of the German Confederation. Prussian Prime Minister Otto Von Bismarck has issued an ultimatum demanding that the November Constitution should be abolished within 48 hours. Given the short deadline, this is politically impossible, and the demand has consequently rejected. It seems that war is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900054OPTA;We will be victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90055;\n\nThe question of Schleswig-Holstein's place within the German Confederation has now finally been resolved -- in our favor. This will have larger repercussions, as the free German states will see that $COUNTRY$ is the true leader of the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90055OPTA;Our mastery of Germany awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90056;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. This puts it in a unique position to assume leadership of the German Confederation as well as dominance over the North German states.

EVT90056OPTA;How DARE they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC90057;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation.

EVTNAME95250;The White Rajah;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95250;\n\nBrunei's control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, as they were governed by the Sultan of Sarawak with minimal control from the capital. During a recent crisis, an Englishman by the name of James Brooke provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order. Brooke has therefore been bestowed the title of governor. This 'White Rajah' is now effectively ruler of the region, and is seeking alliance with Brunei. We must either recognize the independence of an area we only barely controlled, or seek to assert our authority and perhaps anger the English in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95250OPTA;We will recognize the Rajah;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME95251;The Dutch East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95251;\n\nThe Dutch East India Company has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and is urging our government to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands. Indeed, they have been stirring up trouble in the region. Many within our government feel that if the Netherlands is to remain a power to be reckoned with, it must expand its colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME90060;The Eastern Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90060;\n\nThe Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire's hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90060OPTA;We will host the Congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90060OPTB;This is unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90061;Planning for the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90061;\n\nNow that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90061OPTA;The Ottoman Empire must be kept strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90061OPTB;Stability in the Balkans is most important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC90062;\n\nWe have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans.

We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90062OPTA;Our representatives shall attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC90063;\n\nWe have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans.

EVTNAME90064;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90064;\n\nWe have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90064OPTA;We will not risk our relationship with the Ottomans for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME900640;The Cyprus Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC900640;\n\nAn idea has arisen within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: could we perhaps offer our support to the Ottomans in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for a lease on Cyprus? Our support could make a great deal of difference for them... and the island's proximity to Suez makes it of strategic importance. The Ottomans could use all the support they can get, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900640OPTA;Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900640OPTB;We have no interest in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC900641;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with a proposal: they will lend their support to us in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for Cyprus. The island's proximity to Suez makes it of strategic importance, after all, and while some might consider the offer an insult there are others who suggest that without this offer it's just as likely the island will be offered to Greece. $FROMCOUNTRY$ could ensure it isn't... and we could use all the allies in the Congress we can get.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900641OPTA;Agree to the deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900641OPTB;No. Cyprus is not a bargaining chip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME900642;The Deal is Struck;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC900642;\n\nThe Ottomans have agreed to the lease of Cyprus. Now we just need to make sure that we do all we can to make sure the Ottomans are kept strong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900642OPTA;We shall do our best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME900643;The Ottomans Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC900643;\n\nThe Ottomans have refused our offer. Evidently they will take their chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900643OPTA;We accept their decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT900643OPTB;Then they shall receive no support from us whatsoever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME900645;The Bosnian Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC900645;\n\n$COUNTRY$ has a reasonable issue to bring before the upcoming Congress: while it seems beyond question that the Bosnians will be given independence, we could make a case for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ stewardship over Bosnia at the Congress and it seems likely we would be heeded... though it would, without a doubt, upset the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME90065;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Keep the Empire Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90065;\n\nThe great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90065OPTA;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90066;\n\nThe great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90067;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90067;\n\nOur delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90067OPTA;We will abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90067OPTB;Never! $COUNTRY$ will not be ordered about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90068;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90068;\n\nOur delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consensus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90069;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90071;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME900715;Legacy of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC900715;\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ delegates were sent to the recent Congress -- reasonable considering it was the fate of our country and the entire Balkans that was being decided, or so we thought. As it turns out, the great powers of Europe decided what was to become of $COUNTRY$ without our participation, and while we received some benefit it has come to us at a price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC152009872;\n\nThere is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership -- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective.

EVT152009873OPTB;We will not stand for military rule in $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95639;\n\nThe Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them -- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95639OPTA;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95640;Persecution of French Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95640;\n\nThe Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95640OPTA;Demand Cochinchina, or it is war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME95641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95641;\n\nFirst they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95641OPTA;Turn over Cochinchina. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95641OPTB;They are a paper tiger. Let them come, if they dare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME95645;The Suzerainty of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95645;\n\nWe have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers?

EVTNAME95646;The King of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95646;\n\nKing Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the Foreigners intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the Foreigners and asked for protection, and the Foreigners have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet, do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95652OPTA;We have no choice. Surrender the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95652OPTB;Never! They will have to take it from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95653;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ stubbornly refuses to relinquish hold over its conquered lands. It falls on us to protect these unfortunates by use of force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95653OPTA;A foolish move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95654;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95654;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has bowed before our demand. Good relations have been restored..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95654OPTA;A wise move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95655;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95655;\n\nWe are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95655OPTA;Give them what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95655OPTB;That will solve nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95656;The Dai Viet Emperor Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95656;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us a state as concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95656OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95657;The Dai Viet Emperor has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95657;\n\nThe Dai Viet have refused to submit. Apparently they will fight until the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT95657OPTA;An unfortunate choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME185;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Prohibition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC185;\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been increasingly active in one of our states this year, with a campaign to harass local public houses and liquor merchants. Many of their more politically-minded members have even approached members of the government in $CAPITAL$, pushing for greater support for their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT185OPTA;Support the movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT185OPTB;Nonsense. They take this too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME186;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Libertines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC186;\n\nThe libertine culture in $COUNTRY$ has drawn criticism, with news of a scandal that reaches to the very heights of government. Several ministers are accused of unsavory dealings, and there are calls in $CAPITAL$ for the government to support religious groups in their calls for moderation and temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT186OPTA;There is no need for such action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT186OPTB;Some restraint is best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18210;The Right to Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18210;\n\nA bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT18210OPTA;Let the bill pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT18210OPTB;That will cause too many problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT18210OPTC;Don't bring this up again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18215;Party Loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18215;\n\nA group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$. They've succeeded in gathering enough clout to pass a bill strengthening the power of the party whips, and ensuring that the party's influence in the government remains absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT18215OPTA;We must have unity in the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT18215OPTB;No. Let the government rule as it desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18220;The Right to Information;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18220;\n\nA bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18225;The Right to Gather;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18225;\n\nA bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated -- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT18225OPTA;They are right. We cannot abide this sort of rabble-rousing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT18225OPTB;No, the rules shall stay as they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18230;Rights of the Opposition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18230;\n\nMembers of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98600;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98600;\n\nThere has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98600OPTA;We will make the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98600OPTB;There is no point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98605;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98605;\n\nDiplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion -- and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98605OPTA;Grant $FROMCOUNTRY$ its freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98605OPTB;Refuse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98606;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98606;\n\nNot unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion -- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98606OPTA;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98607;$COUNTRY$ Granted Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98607;\n\nOur diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98607OPTA;We are most fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98608;\n\nIt appears the threat of a war of independence was enough to secure $COUNTRY$'s freedom. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98610;\n\nIt appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence -- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98610OPTA;Then it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98610OPTB;We shall let them go. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98611;Must We Fight Alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98611;\n\nSince $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98611OPTA;Attempt to find allies quietly. §RGain 3 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98611OPTB;There is no need for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98612;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98612;\n\nRepresentatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98612OPTA;Agree to the alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98612OPTB;No, this is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98613;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98613;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our secret alliance. Whether they will indeed help once the war begins remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98613OPTA;It gives us hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98614;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98614;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our request. Hopefully they don't inform our overlords of our intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98614OPTA;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90075;The Fate of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90075;\n\nEgypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90075OPTA;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90076;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90076;\n\nEgypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.\n\n§RNOTE: In case of war, you need to enforce the "Make Puppet" CB on Egypt to inherit it.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90076OPTA;Egypt is part of the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90076OPTB;We are willing to negotiate a settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90077;Negotiations with the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90077;\n\nWhile we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90077OPTA;We agree to the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90077OPTB;Never! We reject all Ottoman influence in Egypt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90078;Egypt Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90078;\n\nOur negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine -- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90078OPTA;This is for the best. §GLose 5 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90079;Egypt Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90079;\n\nDespite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90079OPTA;So must it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90080;The Egyptian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90080;\n\nThe Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90080OPTA;Glory to Egypt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90081;Egypt Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90081;\n\nWe have brought Egypt to its knees and restored Ottoman rule to the area. Now we must decide whether to be gracious and allow them to retain autonomy, while restricting their land and power, or whether to rule all of Egypt directly and face the possibility of rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90081OPTA;Restrict their lands and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90081OPTB;We shall rule them directly. §RGain 15 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90082;Rebellion Against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082;\n\nAn uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ has gained popularity throughout the region, spreading the unrest throughout all of $STATENAME$. Local authorities have moved swiftly in an attempt to keep the violence contained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90082OPTA;Put down the uprising at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90083;Anger Over Egyptian Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90083;\n\nStill stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms and there are fears that if they are not satisfied they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90083OPTA;We will give in to their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90083OPTB;The government will not submit to reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90084;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90084;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair -- instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90084OPTA;Withdraw our support for the Ottomans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90084OPTB;We will continue our current path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90085;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90085;\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90085OPTA;Support the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90085OPTB;The Ottomans are on their own;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90086;\n\nWe have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90086OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90087;The Fall of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90087;\n\nOur forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90087OPTA;We will submit to the Turks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90087OPTB;Never! We hold out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90088;The Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90088;\n\nThe Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90088OPTA;We accept their surrender. §RPrevents annexing Egypt§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90088OPTB;There will be no peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90089;End of the Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90089;\n\nThe Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90089OPTA;Make peace. We did what we went to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90089OPTB;We will continue as we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90090;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90090;\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90090OPTA;Support the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90090OPTB;We shall remain neutral;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90091;\n\nWe have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn't done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90091OPTA;We hope they will not intervene;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90091OPTB;This is an affront to $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90092;\n\nWe have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90092OPTA;$FROMCOUNTRY$ must back down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90092OPTB;We do not seek conflict with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Withdrawal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90093;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90093OPTA;We withdraw our support of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90093OPTB;We will not back down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90094;\n\nEgypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced. We can let the matter lie, or fight for both our stake in Egypt and our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT90094OPTA;There is nothing more to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800150;\n\nPan-nationalist rebels demanding a greater $UNION_ADJ$ union have taken over $CAPITAL$, and have begun spreading the idea of $COUNTRY$ becoming part of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ no matter the cost to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army is stamping out the rebellion as best it can, but fears persist that this could develop into a much larger problem if it continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97105;Rebellion Against Foreign Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97105;\n\nA dispute between $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrats and a foreign governor has exploded into a riots in $CAPITAL$. Many $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed from the yoke of its oppressor, and are ready to rise up and fight against the foreign armies that are sure to come. The idea that $COUNTRY$ may become a battleground pleases few, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90040;The Sepoy Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90040;\n\nA mutiny by a group of sepoys in the service of the British East India company has ignited lingering resentment amongst our Indian subjects into open resistance against our rule. Should this grow out of hand, all of our holdings in British India could be in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800056;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been toppled, and the rebels blame $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence as one of the primary causes of the old regime's corruption. We have lost our influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as a result, and the only question that remains is whether we wish to press our claim by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800060;The Proletariat Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800060;\n\nAn opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of communism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, the workers around the world will continue to slave under bourgeois oppression. The proletariats in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800061;The Spread of Fascism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800061;\n\nAn opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of fascism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be seen as shirking our duty to the fascist cause. The government elite in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800062;The Spread of Radicalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800062;\n\nAn opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of radicalism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be admitting that we cannot aid the spread of the bourgeois revolution. The liberal elite in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800063;The Cause of Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800063;\n\nAn opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of democracy in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, we will be seen as abandoning those who live under the rule of tyrants. Liberals in $CAPITAL$ are calling on us to aid the cause of world freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800064;We Were Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800064;\n\n Several of our agents in $FROMCOUNTRY$ were discovered and interrogated, and word of our efforts have spread. This will have an impact on our infamy, and the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ may choose to take the issue as cause for war against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800065;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800065;\n\nWe have reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda being spread in one of our border provinces. Clearly the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government does not respect our sovereignty. Word of the event has leaked out, and members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are calling for immediate action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800066;Workers of the World;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800066;\n\nIf communism is to make strides in the modern era, the ruling proletariat of every nation must work together towards a common goal. Towards that end, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leaders have called on the government to hold talks with a fellow communist nation to bring us closer together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800067;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Envoy Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800067;\n\nAn envoy has arrived from $FROMCOUNTRY$, offering to improve relations between our country and theirs. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ leadership believes that nations so closely aligned in ideology should become closer in truth. Refusing their overtures could be seen as an insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800068;Workers of the World;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800073;\n\nThe threats to the modern world are many: communism, fascism, tyranny in all forms.

EVTNAME800075;A Communist Summit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800075;\n\nThe time has come for the great communist powers of the world to stand together. A summit has been proposed in $CAPITAL$ that would bring our nations closer, though it also has the chance of going badly and driving us further apart. Do we dare make the attempt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800076;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800076;\n\nAn envoy has arrived from $FROMCOUNTRY$, offering to hold a summit in their capital to bring our two great powers closer together. Refusing their overtures could be seen as an insult, but it's also possible the summit could go poorly and make our relations worse rather than better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800077;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit of $YEAR$ a Success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800077;\n\nThe summit in $CAPITAL$ was a smashing success! $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats left pleased with the progress, and our relations have improved significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800078;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800078;\n\nThe summit in $CAPITAL$ unfortunately failed to make any significant progress. Talks with $FROMCOUNTRY$ stalled, and even with our common ideological ground there are just too many issues remaining between our nations to improve relations more than marginally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800079;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit of $YEAR$ a Disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800079;The summit in $CAPITAL$ went very poorly. There are too many issues between our nations, and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats left in a huff. Our relations have suffered as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800080;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800080;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent a polite refusal to our summit request, saying now is not a good time for a summit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME800084;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800084;\n\nA violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by resentment towards their nation and its ideological hostility towards our communist regime. We will need to decide now whether we are conciliatory in our response, potentially losing prestige for the socialist movement, or whether we imply that their nation's policies are what led to this unfortunate event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME800088;Incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800088;\n\nA violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ resentment towards $COUNTRY$ and our ideology. Their response to the unfortunate event has thankfully been conciliatory, and our government has received an official apology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800089;Insult from $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800089;\n\nA violent incident has occurred at our embassy in $FROMCOUNTRY$, spurred on by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ resentment towards $COUNTRY$ and our ideology. Their response has been insulting, publicly blaming our policies even though their own careless disregard for the safety of our diplomats and their political upheaval is clearly at fault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800090;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Does Not Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800090;\n\nDespite our apology, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it is enraged by the incident and that our lack of control over our citizens is to blame. While they are seen as being unreasonably aggressive, war is even a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800091;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has accepted our apology for the incident, and while our relations have been damaged the incident has mostly blown over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Enraged;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800092;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ leaders have declared our actions outrageous, and that the incident was no doubt secretly supported by our government. They claim this provides them ample grounds for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Backs Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800093;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has backed down from escalating the incident into a war. The entire business has harmed relations between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800094;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800094;\n\nSeveral foreigners were attacked in $CAPITAL$, an incident spurred on by differences between their country and our government's communist policies. It has severely harmed our relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800095;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800095;\n\nSeveral foreigners were attacked in $CAPITAL$, an incident spurred on by differences between their country and our government's fascist policies. It has severely harmed our relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME800147;Sepoy Rebels Force Concessions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800147;\n\nThe Indian subcontinent has been overwhelmed by the Sepoy rebels. Our garrisons are in retreat, and our colonial governors have already fled for safer ports. We have no choice but to give into their demands, many of which involve removing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence from any of the nations we have subjugated over the years of our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800147OPTA;We have no choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800148;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Driven Out;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800148;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in our region has come to an end, thanks to the spread of the Sepoy Rebellion. With $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governors fleeing the nearby regions in droves, our nation suddenly has a chance to regain lost lands and obtain our freedom... whether we wish it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800148OPTA;We never liked $FROMCOUNTRY$ anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800149;Rebels Storm $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800149;\n\nAfter a swarm of violence and looting that engulfed the entire nation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rioters have stormed the capital. The government has been forced to make numerous concessions, in a desperate bid to calm the people. So far it seems to have worked, and has spared many leaders from being executed by angry mobs, but it remains to be seen whether these concessions will only cause more problems in the end than they solved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800149OPTA;We have no choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97700;Patriot Rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97700;\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97700OPTA;We welcome their return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97700OPTB;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800151;\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in a neighboring country, and have gained sufficient control that they have sent word they wish to bring the province back to $COUNTRY$. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800152;Provinces Brought Under Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800152;\n\nWith the patriot rebellion now over, our provinces have now been brought under control and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors are once again in command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800152OPTA;That is a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800055OPTA;Let them go. §GLose 1 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800055OPTB;We will salvage what influence we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800055OPTC;We will restore order in our vassal! §RGain 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800056OPTA;They're not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800056OPTB;We will press our claim. §RGain 1 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97562OPTA;We have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97565;Call For Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97565;\n\nThe rebels are gaining too much ground! We must call for help from our protectors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97566OPTA;We will do what we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97566OPTB;They must stand on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97567;Danger Passed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97567;\n\nThe danger of imminent overthrow has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97561;Rebels in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97562;$CAPITAL$ Burns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97562;\n\n$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties -- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97566;Trouble in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97566;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$. They warn us that if the rebels are successful, it's very likely that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would cease to be in $COUNTRY$'s sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97570;Native Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97570;\n\nNow that $COUNTRY$ is free, native $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens are beginning to protest against the colonial regime that still remains. Foreigners still hold the highest positions in the government, and have a privileged status in comparison to those they once ruled over as a colony. In $PROVINCENAME$, the recent arrest of a native for trespassing on the estate of a foreigner has led to riots -- and dissension has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97570OPTA;They are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, not 'foreigners'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17710;Communist Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17710;\n\nCommunists have been distributing literature among the working classes in one of our states. They are claiming that the common man needs to rise up against the 'bourgeois' class, and that rule by the workers is the only way they can obtain fair conditions and a truly utopian society. Government officials are concerned, and some say that we need to crack down hard on this kind of talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17715;The Common Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17715;\n\nSocialist leanings have become quite prevalent in parts of $COUNTRY$, and among these socialists radical ideas have been spreading -- namely that the common man can only achieve true freedom by overthrowing the government and establishing a rule by the working class. They cite the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as tyrannical, and one that will never bend to true reform... and the people have been listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17720;Communist Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17720;\n\nThe tense situation in one of our states has been aggravated by the presence of communist agitators, spurring on the working classes to rise up against the government and institute a rule by the workers. We could step in, but that might only provoke a rebellion. Allowing the agitators to continue spreading their propaganda, however, might let them get a stronger foothold in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17730;Communists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17730;\n\nA communist demonstration in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, with shouts decrying the state of workers in $COUNTRY$, has gained the communists a great deal of attention and sympathy throughout $STATENAME$. Attempting to crack down on these agitators may only cause the demonstrations to turn into violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17710OPTA;Crack down on this menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17710OPTB;Let them talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17715OPTA;Crack down on these radicals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17715OPTB;Keep the problem localized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17720OPTA;We cannot allow this talk to spread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17720OPTB;This must not come to violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17730OPTA;Crack down on the communists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT17730OPTB;Let them demonstrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800100;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Patriots;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800100;\n\nWe have been contacted by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots, currently living under the dominion of a neighboring country. They suggest that there is an opportunity to stir up sentiment among those living there so that they may rise up and rejoin their mother country. There is, of course, a risk that our efforts could be discovered and bring war down upon us. Should we help them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800100OPTA;We must free our brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800100OPTB;It's too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800101;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Spreading Dissent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800101;\n\nWe have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been inciting dissent among minorities in $COUNTRY$. This is an act of aggression that deserves a swift response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800101OPTA;We will not tolerate this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800101OPTB;Let it slide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800102;We Have Been Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800102;\n\nOur efforts to incite $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been discovered. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is threatening war over this breach of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800102OPTA;Let them come! §RGain 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97175;\n\nThe rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and, given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97175OPTA;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97180;\n\nRebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97180OPTA;We will assume control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97180OPTB;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97181;Colonial Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97181;\n\nWe have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97181OPTA;We'll be back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97182;Free of Colonial Control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97182;\n\nWe are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97185;Order Restored in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97185;\n\nWe have restored order to our colony in $STATENAME$... at least for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT97185OPTA;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME81002212;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Neutrality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81002212;\n\nWe have been pulled into an outside war, despite our dedication to neutrality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT81002212OPTA;We must remain Neutral!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT81002212OPTB;We must discard our Neutrality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19365;The Restoration of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19365;\n\nAn idea has been spreading among the people of $COUNTRY$... some of our lands are under foreign control, but it appears to be beyond our power to regain them on our own. $COUNTRY$ has a great power as its benevolent protector, however, does it not? The people are urging our government to approach them for aid, though some within the government are concerned this could possibly alienate our ally as well, not to mention stir up new hostility with our neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19365OPTA;We will approach our protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19365OPTB;We will leave the matter alone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19366;The Restoration of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19366;\n\nDiplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, appealing for help in restoring their lost lands. With $COUNTRY_ADJ$ help, they say, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will prove a much worthier ally. There are those concerned with the trouble this might stir up, however. Should we look the other way, prove $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence has weight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19366OPTA;Tell them we shall consider it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19366OPTB;We cannot afford such a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19367;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to consider our proposal. It's possible they will, in the end, take no military action on our behalf. It's come to our attention that relations between them and one of our neighbors has cooled severely, however, so a war may yet come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19367OPTA;Then there is hope. §RGain 3 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19368;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to intervene on our behalf. Worse, it appears the purpose of our mission has leaked to at least one of our neighbors, angering them greatly bringing threats of war against $COUNTRY$. Did $FROMCOUNTRY$ inform them? Have we been abandoned by our ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19368OPTA;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19370;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Overlords;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19370;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers marched into $CAPITAL$ today, accompanying the new $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governor who will be overseeing the operation of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ puppet government. Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again? Perhaps $COUNTRY$ has suffered enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19370OPTA;A sad day for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19301;The Dream Is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19301;\n\nThere was once a dream in this country - a dream of a land of liberty, of new opportunities. People would flock to the United States of America seeking freedom, opportunities and shelter from the horrors of war and intolerance of the old world. The Statue of Liberty, the USA proudest symbol, used to symbolize that, and that was the first thing immigrants saw when entering our country. The Statue is still there, standing ominously in the bay of New York, but it doesn't represent that dream anymore, nor any of the values it used to. With the recrudescence of the institutions in our country, the change from a democratic government, the Statue lost all meaning and people from all over the world stopped being enchanted by what it represented. \n \n The dream is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19301;Who needs immigrants anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19006;\n\nOur independence is gradually being undercut and more and more becoming something that only exists on paper, as several foreign Great Powers vie for control over our political institutions. Recently, tensions have erupted between several great powers each vying for dominance over our government. If any of them attempts to assert themselves in $COUNTRY$, it will mean conflict with our government, the other great powers, and possibly even war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19007;\n\nTensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted regarding dominance over the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We are forced into a position where we must either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY$'s independence, or back down and lose much of the influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ we currently hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19015;Allies or Enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19015;\n\nRelations with one of our allies have cooled. Perhaps we should reconsider our alliance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19015OPTA;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT19015OPTB;Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19016;Great Power Influence in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19016;\n\nWe are under the influence of a Great Power. Or we should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME37236;The Construction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37236;\n\nWork on the foundations of the Eiffel Tower began. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block built of limestone each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. Each shoe was anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were complete by $YEAR$ and the erection of the ironwork began. For this part, we need to set a budget for the construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME37237;The Eiffel Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37237;\n\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustré completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large French flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME3697000;The Construction of the Clock Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3697000;\n\nDuring the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the fire of 1834, the parliament determined that the new buildings should incorporate an impressive clock tower and passed a bill to that end in $YEAR$. This clock tower will take years to be built but it will be a massive accomplishment for our country. The only thing left for the building to start is to define the budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME3697001;The Clock Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3697001;\n\nThe completion of the Clock Tower marks the end of the reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster. The clock tower was constructed on the northern extremity of the new Houses of Parliament that were built next to Westminster Hall. The commission for the clock itself demanded a high level of accuracy, the specifications drafted by the Royal Astronomer required that "the first stroke of the hour bell should register the time, correct to within one second per day, and furthermore that it should telegraph its performance twice a day to Greenwich Observatory, where a record would be kept." The second and final version of the hour bell was the largest ever cast in the UK. It was so colossal that a team of 16 horses was needed to pull the wagon upon which it rested from the foundry to the Tower. The transportation took on the character of a parade, with enthusiastic crowds lining the streets as the caravan made its way through London. The bell and tower got nicknamed "Big Ben".;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME95500;The $CAPITAL$ Conference of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95500;\n\nThe colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa.

EVTNAME95502;The Age of Colonialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95502;\n\nWord has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them -- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

What they also bring is death, and we must always be wary what lies behind their smiles.' \n \n $COUNTRY$ stands on good terms with much of the western world, but our leaders are all too aware how quickly that could change. The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority.

EVTDESC95505;\n\nEuropean presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses -- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official.

Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence -- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority.

EVTDESC95508;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab's owner -- who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME800012;Intervention in $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800012;\n\nWe have been secretly approached by certain members within the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, suggesting that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention to free them from foreign control might be in both our interests. $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be free to seek its own destiny, while $COUNTRY$ would gain an ally. The catch, of course, is that the attempt could look like interference to the rest of the world... and earn us the enmity of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s rulers in particular. If we make the attempt, we should learn of the results within a week at the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800013;\n\nA foreign power has meddled in the affairs of $FROMCOUNTRY$, taking advantage of the unrest there to engineer a coup which has freed them from our control.

EVTDESC800015;\n\nThe answer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ is clear: they won't intervene in our internal affairs. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800016;Intervention Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800016;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ attempted to intervene, but the resulting orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$ has failed to drive out the influence of our overlord. Worse, it has resulted in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ being greatly damaged, as many see them as instigators rather than would-be liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800017;Free At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800017;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has supported the could d'etat in $CAPITAL$, but with the change came an orgy of violence that has seen $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ damaged along with that of our overlord. Many people in $COUNTRY$ are left with hard feelings, and see $FROMCOUNTRY$ as an instigator rather than a liberator. What will come next depends entirely on whether reprisals will come our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800018;Free At Last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800018;\n\nForeign intervention has succeeded in freeing our government from foreign rule. After an orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$, citizens are celebrating in the streets. $COUNTRY$ has a new destiny as a truly independent nation... provided no reprisals come out way, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800021;Attempted Coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800021;\n\nA foreign power attempted to use their influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ to take advantage of the unrest there and free them from our control. Their efforts have come to naught, and their agents have been arrested and many of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ malcontents exposed and imprisoned. The question remains, however, as to what we will do in response to this outrage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800022;Attempt Thwarted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800022;\n\nOur attempt to interfere in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s government was thwarted. We have lost influence there, and angered their overlord. This may lead to war, but we will have to wait and see what develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800023;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Freed At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800023;\n\nOur attempt to engineer a coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$ was successful, but at the cost of a great deal of our influence there. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is angry, and it's possible their overlords may attempt to retaliate either against them or against us. We will have to wait and see what develops of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC98650;\n\nThe call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater state -- one which will forge a greater power in a new world order. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, but many welcome the nation and rightly state that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s influence in $COUNTRY$ is already great. If we deny the union, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government may decide to enforce their claim on us whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC11120;\n\nThe call has come to $COUNTRY$ to unite with Yugoslavia, a union of Slavic countries interested in protecting the Balkans from the encroachment of other European powers. Whether a union of cultures which have before now often been at war, and indeed still have considerable enmity for each other, will be difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT11120OPTA;We will answer the call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC11115;Many within $COUNTRY$ have always considered it a dream to form a greater union of the Slavic peoples, one spanning all of the Balkans and uniting them under a common flag. Such a nation would be far better suited at resisting the encroachment of foreign powers into the region. Now seems like the perfect opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to form such a union. Do we proceed with the creation of Yugoslavia, or let the dream die here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME11110;A North German Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11110;\n\nAn open discussion amongst liberals in $COUNTRY$ has been occurring regarding the formation of a confederation of North German states. Conditions have never been right for it in the past, but many believe such a union is needed if the Germans are ever to have true security and take their place among the powers of the world. A $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led movement to create such a confederation might go over well with our neighbors, if we made the attempt to create it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME880130;Reactionary Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880130;\n\nRumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionary party. Aristocrats have allegedly been receiving payments and other illegal benefits for supporting the cause, while the party leader is shown to have made a fortune with sensitive national information. This has been declared beyond the pale even by reactionary supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the reactionary cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880140;Conservative Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880140;\n\nRumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ conservative party. Party leaders were allegedly paid secretly by local land owners to tweak laws in their favor, governmental positions given to favorites, goods stolen from  government warehouses - the list goes on and on. This has been declared beyond the pale even by conservative supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the conservative cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880150;Liberal Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880150;\n\nRumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberal party. Popular candidates have allegedly been involved in smuggling of illicit goods, used questionable tactics to buy votes and speculated on investments with government funds. This has been declared beyond the pale even by liberal supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the liberal cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880160;Radical Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880160;\n\nRumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ radical party. Several wealthy businessmen evaded taxes with the help of party members, who in return received kickbacks and a great deal of illegal funding for the party. This has been declared beyond the pale even by radical supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the radical cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880170;Socialist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880170;\n\nRumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist party. Illegal union activity, blackmail of important citizens, mistreatment of servants - the facts speak for themselves. This has been declared beyond the pale even by socialist supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely hurting the socialist cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880180;Communist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880180;\n\nRumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ communist party. While preaching water for the masses, important communist party officials appear to drink wine. Police have secured several party coffers filled with dirty money from illegal activities, stolen art and counterfeit documents. This has been declared beyond the pale even by communist supporters, severely hurting the communist cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880190;Fascist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880190;\n\nRumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fascist party. A militant group associated with the fascists was revealed to have murdered several socialist politicians, tortured priests and attempted to burn the mansion of a wealthy minority leader. This has been declared beyond the pale even by fascist supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the fascist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880200;Grave Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880200;\n\nAs more and more evidence against the ruling party has come to light, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it has no choice but to resign and call an election. The decision was made after several weeks of heated debate, and it is already well-known that certain members of the government -- those most sorely hit by the scandal -- have been repudiated by the ruling party and will not be seeking re-election. How this will affect the government's chances is so far unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880210;New Evidence Worsens Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880210;\n\nInvestigation of the current party scandal by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ press has brought to light a number of interesting facts. It seems that abuse of power and influence goes well beyond what was initially revealed. Only the surface of this affair has been touched so far, and God only knows what might turn up within the next few weeks. No-one in $COUNTRY$ appears to be discussing anything else at the moment, and already there are calls in the press for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to step down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999000;National Debate: Trade Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME999003;National Debate: Citizenship Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention, and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999020;There shall be peace and quite in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999021;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occurred in several large factories, with incidents of street fighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999021;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999022;Riots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999022;\n\nThe tensions from the current election campaign have escalated, with disorder spreading fast in $CAPITAL$ and spreading elsewhere.

EVTNAME999034;The Radicals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999034;\n\nIt looks like the radicals, a fringe group who have taken the liberal ideals to their extreme, have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999035;The Social Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election -- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform. They have been actively campaigning for people to support both, and have been attracting a lot of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999036;Reactionary Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999036;\n\nThere are a large number of people, particularly among the ruling elite of $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999037;Surge of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999037;\n\nIt looks like the conservatives have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999040;National Debate: Voting Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999040;\n\n'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999040;They are right - support their reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999040;Voting rights for the middle class? Nay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999040;A reform is long past due - issue a new voting right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999041;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999041;\n\n'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' While being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999041;Sounds like a good idea, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999041;Stop these ungrateful wretches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999041;We shall do this right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999042;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999042;\n\n'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweat and toil has brought the nation forward! We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n \n The subject of voting rights for the poor has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999042;Better late then never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999042;Better never than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC999044;\n\n'They have beaten me, again and again. Why? Because I am a proud citizen who will speak the truth! I don't believe that the ruling party will save us. And my weapon is logic, but theirs is the stick.'\n\nThe issue of political party harassment has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999044;This has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999044;There is no need to change the system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999045;Election Fraud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999045;\n\n'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!'\n\nThe issue of voter district gerrymandering has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999045;You are right, we have to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999045;Want me to play the world's smallest violin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999046;Request For Privacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999046;\n\n'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999046;I guess some privacy would be in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999046;What's next? Blindfolds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999049;National Debate: Unemployment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999049;\n\nThe election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999049;The socialists are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999049;Do not get involved in the debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999050;\n\nUnemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999050;Communism is our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME999055;The Child Labor Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all laborers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999056;The Rights of Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999057;The Immigration Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999060;War Dominates the Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999060;\n\nSo far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999061;Talk of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999061;\n\nWhile $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbors, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999065;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999065;\n\nA recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT880130OPTA;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT880200OPTA;A bad way to start an election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT880210OPTA;Things do not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31510;A Greater Austrian Destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31510;\n\nAustrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say Austria's unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. Still others say that, no, Austria already has its own name and empire, one that stretches over many cultures who would never welcome becoming more dominated by the Germans... not to mention that a Greater Germany would alarm the powers of Europe to such a degree it would almost surely herald a war. Thus the question arises: what shall our path be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31511;\n\nWe have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31515;\n\nAustrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31516;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31518;\n\nThere has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31519;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers -- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31521;\n\nAustria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams. Whole portions of the Empire have either declared their outright independence or their intention to reunite with their homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31530;\n\nAustrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering such a union could alarm the powers of Europe to a great degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31531;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. While such a nation would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would likely object to such a union. Is Greater Germany worth the possibility of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT31515OPTB;We shall give our non-German states independence before joining Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME800098;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Citizens Attacked in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800098;\n\nSeveral of our country's citizens have been attacked in the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$, an incident spurred on by the severe differences between our country's ideology and theirs. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has been extremely reluctant to admit any involvement in the affair, and our relations have been hurt as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2560;The Buffer State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2560;\n\nThis so-called 'buffer state' will not stop us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2560OPTA;Enough is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2600;$STATENAME$ Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2600;\n\n$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole. There are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags waving in $PROVINCENAME$, flown by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, so it does not seem so far-fetched an idea that $STATENAME$ be eventually considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory by the world at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2605;$PROVINCENAME$ Integrated into $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2605;\n\n$COUNTRY$ has controlled $PROVINCENAME$ for a long time -- long enough for those within $PROVINCENAME$ to truly consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and for the rest of the world to consider the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to the province to be legitimate as well. Though there are still some unhappy with the development, $PROVINCENAME$ is now considered an integral part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2610;$STATENAME$ Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2610;\n\n$STATENAME$ is considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory -- that is only in dispute by those neighbors who still have recognized claims on the area, and who maintain that many within $STATENAME$ consider themselves citizens of their country and not ours. The first step in rendering their claim invalid would be to enact a policy that encourages the assimilation of all people within $STATENAME$... they should be $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and hold no other nationality above ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2611;Assimilation Policies Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2611;\n\nWith the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military who warn that this is a dangerous idea, and that allowing these foreign identities to perpetuate will only lead to further conflict with our neighbors -- but, for now, their voices have been ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2615;Flags Burned in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2615;\n\nA demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them -- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$. Authorities broke up the demonstration, but there continues to be a growing discontent in the area. The turmoil has even spread to other citizens, who have begun calling on the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to end its assimilation policies and let the minority groups be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2616;Incident in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2616;\n\nThe recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbors with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least -- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2620;Flags Flying in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2620;\n\nA parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high -- and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2625;$PROVINCENAME$ Assimilated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2625;\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is the only one that can now be found flying in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. At long last, it can be considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and only $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. Even those who are members of other cultures no longer consider themselves truly part of our neighbors -- much as those neighbors might be unhappy with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2626;Claims in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2626;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ continues to hold some of our lands, lands which until today have always been considered part of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national territory. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ program of assimilation has succeeded, however, in weaning our own people away from any feeling as if this true. They no longer consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$, and indeed the international community appears to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2650;\n\nAccording to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to them -- and only the ones that belong to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2651;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2651;\n\nAccording to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to another nation -- but only those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2660;Our Lands Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2660;\n\nAs a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$. \n \n §RNOTE: If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back. Be careful!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2600OPTA;We should begin integrating $STATENAME$. §RGain 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME2601;Integration Canceled in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2601;\n\nThere is no longer a need to justify a claim in $STATENAME$, since it already exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2601OPTA;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2605OPTA;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2610OPTA;Begin assimilating $STATENAME$. §RGain 2 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT2611OPTA;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2612;Assimilation Canceled in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2612;\n\nThere is no longer a need for the assimilation policies currently underway in $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2612OPTA;It was worth the effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2615OPTA;The assimilation must continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2615OPTB;Abandon assimilation in $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT2660OPTB;We will keep everything we've gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98800OPTA;An excellent development!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98300;War-Time Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98300;\n\nAs the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98301;\n\nAs the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98302;\n\n$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems -- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98303;Contentious Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98303;\n\nAs the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98304;\n\nWith the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98305;\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere. Supporters of the ruling regime have turned out in force, as have the hopefuls seeking to defeat the current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98310;Conservatives Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98310;\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the conservative party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME11380019;Constitutional Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11380019;In a surprise election win, the fascists have taken power in the government. Technically they are allowed to do so, and their party has not been banned. There are concerns, however, that their ultimate goal is to take over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and that this election win is just the first step in doing so. Some are even suggesting the possibility of voter fraud. Regardless, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken... and the monarchy must decide whether to intervene and refuse the fascists their mandate as many expect. Failure to intervene means admitting that they have no power and thus relinquishing all control over the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC11380022;\n\nIn a surprise election win, the communists have taken power in the government -- despite the fact that their party opposes the monarchy and has been banned. Regardless, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken, and thus a political showdown has resulted: the communists cannot be permitted to win, but even if they're refused the next election might simply have the same crisis occur all over again. Perhaps the time has come to reconsider electoral reforms and put the power back where it belongs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME80120;Hui Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80120;\n\nThough tolerant of religious practices, the Hui Muslims in $PROVINCENAME$ are resentful of discrimination by the Qing government. Unrest in the province has stirred up anti-Manchu sentiment, even among non-Muslims. The violence is threatening to spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80121;Panthay Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80121;\n\nHave Peace with Han Chinese! \n Down with Qing court! \n \n A rebellion has erupted in the southern province of Yunnan, led by a rebel named Du Wenxiu. Foreign ambassadors are calling this event the "Panthay Rebellion", a revolt from the Muslims in Yunnan. The man's forces have already captured Dali and driven out the Qing governor, forcing our government to deal with the matter directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80122;Panthay Rebellion Crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80122;\n\nWith Qing forces marching into Kunming, the Panthay Rebellion is officially over. The rebels and their leaders have been routed, and already measures are being taken to ensure there are no further disturbances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80123;Panthay Rebellion Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80123;\n\nWe have driven the hated Manchu from Yunnan. At last, victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80125;The Dungan Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80125;\n\nWith Muslim-led unrest existing throughout the province of Sinkiang, a Tajik adventurer by the name of Yaqub Beg has led rebels to seize the capital of Kashgar and has driven Qing governors away. The situation in the frontier appears to be out of hand, with these Muslims having declared an independent state and full Jihad against the Emperor. This rebellion against our rule is being refereed to as the Dungan Revolt by the Amban of Sinkiang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80126;Dungan Revolt Crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80126;\n\nWith Qing forces marching into Kashgar, the Dungan Revolt is officially over. The rebels and their leaders have been routed, and already measures are being taken to ensure there are no further disturbances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT90904OPTB;Allow them to leave. We will not oppose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90904;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90904;\n\nPerhaps $FROMCOUNTRY$ has grown beyond our ability to control them? They have been far more welcoming of western ways, to the point that now they consider themselves 'civilized' and on par with the barbarians outside of $COUNTRY$... Indeed, they even consider themselves above us, and have thrown off $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule as if it were a bad shadow. They seek to chart an independent course, but should we let them? Should we allow them to pretend they are not part of China, and reject the heritage of thousand thousand years?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160001;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160001;\n\nWe are receiving disturbing reports of anarchy in southern China. A peasant army led by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui has declared the ascendancy of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' and driven out local governors. All within the Qing government agree that we cannot recognize these rebels as having credence -- if we do, it raises the question of whether the Mandate of Heaven is still held by the Imperial throne. That cannot be allowed, and thus the governors must be given the opportunity to crush the rebels and restore order in the Emperor's name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1600010;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared -- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarrassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160002;Taiping Rebellion Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160002;\n\nWe have crushed the 'Heavenly Kingdom', and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160003;Truce With the Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160003;\n\nEven though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160004;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160004;\n\nThough we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160006;\n\nThe continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarrassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160007;The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160007;\n\nThe truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160008;The Taiping Are Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160008;\n\nWe have overthrown the hated Manchu and taken control of all China. Now, as the world watches, the true test comes: transforming the nation into the true Heavenly Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160009;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160009;\n\nA troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160011;\n\nDue to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160012;Taiping Missionaries in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160012;\n\nWe have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu -- and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160013;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160013;\n\nTo many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $STATENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164504;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164504;\n\nThe man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160016;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160016;\n\nReports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller by the name of Yang Xiuqing has taken to walking the South lands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160017;Pro-Christian Riots in $STATENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160017;\n\nFollowers of the 'Heavenly Kingdom' are causing further problems in the south. They are already heavily fortified within $PROVINCENAME$, and many Qing advisors consider it completely beyond our control. Anarchy seems rampant, and all throughout $STATENAME$ these rebels are shouting treason. Can nobody do something about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160020;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160020;\n\nThe followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have spread their influence even further. According to officials in $STATENAME$, the Christian rebels have been spotted in $PROVINCENAME$ and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise throughout the entire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160025;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160025;\n\nOur beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away -- ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a republic is the way forward. Finally, a proper theocracy, without a hereditary ruler, is another option that is considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT160025OPTA;Establish a new dynasty under Hong Tianguifu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT160025OPTB;The Qing Dynasty must rule once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME160026;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160026;\n\nWith our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160501;Missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160501;Christian missionaries are stirring up trouble in southern China, handing out pamphlets in an effort to gain converts. This would not be so objectionable were the pamphlet not also preaching sedition against the Qing Dynasty. The fact that so many in $PROVINCENAME$ are willing to listen to these fools is worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160502;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160502;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $PROVINCENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1605020;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died -- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qing dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16050214;Retreat to Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050214;\n\nWith our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess. We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16050215;Victory over the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050215;\n\nWith their armies defeated, their provinces occupied and their government retreating to Taiwan it has become clear that the Kuomintang no longer has the will to fight. We may now claim dominance over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME162503;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC162503;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have infested yet another province. According to officials in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of Hong Xiuquan have been spotted and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME164599;The Xinhai Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164599;\n\nThe forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections. Army leaders, however, have threatened to oppose the Kuomintang and demanded the republic be under strict Beiyang control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164600;The Tongmenghui;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164600;\n\nRevolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or 'Chinese United League'. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisfied to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What's more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164601;Revolutionary Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164601;\n\nRevolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$. The incident appears to have begun in $PROVINCENAME$, after a demonstration by local workers turned violent. Though authorities have already moved in, the damage is done. What remains is to determine how we react to this outrageous provocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164602;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164602;Members of the proto-nationalist Yihetuan Movement, also known as the Boxers, have staged an uprising in $PROVINCENAME$.

EVTNAME99000;The Righteous Harmony Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99000;\n\n'Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreign!' \n \n Many Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society -- known to foreigners as 'Boxers' -- has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99001;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99001;\n\nAn attack upon a foreign merchant in $PROVINCENAME$ has signaled the arrival of the Boxer movement to $STATENAME$. Already the flags of the Righteous Harmony Society have been spotted, their followers recruiting fellow Chinese to support the Qing government in their struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99005;Attack on Foreigners in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99005;\n\nThroughout all of $STATENAME$, the Boxers are attacking western influence. Smugglers, missionaries, opium peddlers, anyone they can apprehend is being slain or forced to flee for their lives. We have a choice: either look the other way, risking anger from the great powers for these 'atrocities', or send in forces to suppress the Boxers and risk the anger of our own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99006;Boxer Atrocities in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99006;\n\nA group of Chinese nationalists known as the 'Boxers', intent on driving all western influence out of $FROMCOUNTRY$, have attacked a group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several were slain, while others were forced to flee for their lives. Worse, the Qing government has done nothing about it. They are looking the other way while these atrocities are being committed upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99010;Boxers Attack Legation Quarter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99010;\n\nThe Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners -- and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99011;Boxers Attack $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99011;\n\nThe Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozes of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk. The Qing government has looked the other way, an act that is seen by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as a declaration of war. Many are calling upon us to intervene in order to protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens from these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99015;The Boxer Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99015;\n\nWe are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ generals and representatives from all the great powers. The Righteous Harmony Society will be forcibly disbanded, its leaders executed or imprisoned, and our government is once again humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99016;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has submitted to the intervening powers, signing a treaty that promises to forcibly dismantle the Boxers and pay reparations for the atrocities committed in their name -- and explicitly supported by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT99000OPTA;We shall remain silent... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1645091;The Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1645091;\n\nThe Mandate of Heaven was a Chinese political and religious doctrine used to justify the rule of the emperor of China. According to this belief, heaven (tian) - which embodies the natural order and will of the universe - bestows the mandate on a just ruler, the Son of Heaven.\n\nIf a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy, and had lost the mandate. It was also a common belief that natural disasters such as famine and flood were signs of heaven's displeasure with the ruler, so there would often be revolts following major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT1645091OPTA;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1316080;The Opium Trade in China;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316080;\n\nOpium use in China first began with the use of opium for medicinal purposes during the 7th century, the practice of mixing opium with tobacco for smoking spread from Southeast Asia in the 17th century, creating a far greater demand. Imports of opium into China stood at 200 chests annually in 1729, when the first anti-opium edict was promulgated. By the time $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities reissued the prohibition in starker terms in 1799, the figure had leaped: 4,500 chests were imported in 1800. The decade of the 1830s witnessed a rapid rise in opium trade, and by $YEAR$, it had climbed to 40,000 chests. \n\nThe imperial decree had little effect, the Qing government, far away in Peking in the north, would prove unable to halt opium smuggling in the south. A porous border and rampant demand facilitated the trade, resulting in widespread use throughout much of the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1316081;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316081;\n\nA drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local named Lin Weixi in the village of Tsim Sha Tsui. Unlike English common law, Chinese law held the community, rather than the individual, responsible for transgressions. \n\nImperial Commissioner Lin Zexu demanded the death of the culprit and was prepared to accept any sailor, whether innocent or guilty, to settle the matter. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality -- meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these men executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316082;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316082;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well.

While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them a concession port and reparations.

The damnable Japanese are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarrassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement -- hand over Formosa and pay reparations. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them what they want, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316086;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us Formosa as well as reparations. This has improved relations between our countries tremendously, and should go a long way to ensuring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Asia remains strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316175;\n\nWe have lost all patience with the barbarians who call themselves our 'masters'. They ignore our laws, our customs, and force themselves upon the generosity of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ throne at every opportunity. It is time we turned them out, refused them their free reign in our lands and ports and demonstrated the true might of our Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316176;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Envoy Ejected;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316176;\n\nRelations have been cool with $FROMCOUNTRY$, laced with bitterness over our nation's superiority. Lately the situation has reached a boiling point, and we have received a report that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ envoy to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ court has been ejected. Indeed, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals throughout $FROMCOUNTRY$ are reporting harassment and outright violence. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ are being refused berth at Chinese harbors. This is a systematic campaign by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ emperor to reduce our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316180;Empire of the Great Qing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316180;\n\nChina has no need for, nor interest in, foreigners and their gifts no matter how ingenious they may be. It is only due to the emperor's generosity that foreigners are allowed to trade at all, and all such trade must take place at our will. The yi barbarians should tremble as they obey us and show no negligence! Barbarians shall bow down before the Chinese emperor in the manner customary for tributary envoys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316181;The Arrow Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316181;\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials recently boarded the Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship (a lorcha) that was suspected of piracy and smuggling. Twelve Chinese crew members were arrested on suspicion of piracy by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities. British officials have demanded the release of the sailors, however, claiming that because the ship had recently been British-registered, it was under their protection. They also demand reparations. The Imperial court has been enraged by this claim, suggesting that agreeing to British demands would give smugglers free reign throughout China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1316182;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials recently boarded the Arrow, a ship that -- according to all reports -- was flying British colors at the time. The Chinese claim this isn't the case, and we've received news that they intend to crack down on the opium trade throughout the Empire. The British government is up in arms, saying that we must exert our influence over the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ if we are to retain our position in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131709;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131709;\n\nAn incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qing government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge -- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The Chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse. Our prestige as an Empire to be reckoned with is being threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131710;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC131711;\n\nBritish diplomats have approached the Tibet government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and China now that Tibet is independent.

EVTDESC131714;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have cooled as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131715;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131715;\n\nOur efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces. The generals in charge of these forces, 'warlords' as some call them, have been gaining a great deal of power. They are part of the Beiyang Army, but fight amongst themselves... And, far worse, are critical of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We will need to watch these generals carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131720;Spread of Anhui Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131720;\n\nWarlord influence has begun to spread into $STATENAME$. These generals are still loyal to $COUNTRY$, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they are taking control of a significant portion of the country. Officials in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME131730;The Warlord Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131730;\n\nResistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their independence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131735;The Struggle for China;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131735;\n\nNow that we are free, we must choose where we stand in the ensuing struggle for the nation's destiny: either side with the Kuomintang and fight for domination of the republic or side with the Beiyang and fight for domination of a united China. Alternatively, we can declare our neutrality in the conflict and let the chips fall where they may.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131736;The Guominjun Clique;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131736;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general by the name of Feng Yuxiang has betrayed his superiors and broken off from the Beiyang armies. He and his supporters have taken the territory under their control and formed a new clique, swearing to topple the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131740;Leader of the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131740;\n\nThe leaders of the Kuomintang are preparing for their drive on Beijing, and $COUNTRY$ is expected to answer the call. Either we side with Nationalist China now, or we must abandon the Kuomintang cause and seek our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131741;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has answered the call, and will unite their forces with ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131742;The War of Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131742;\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are crying out for the nation to once again unify. We must gather our strength and strike out at those who would divide China, leaving it weak for foreigners to prey upon. Already the banners are in the streets, and $COUNTRY$'s generals are saying now is the time to launch an offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131743;War with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131743;\n\nWe have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army is massing on our mutual border, ready to make a massive offensive into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. It seems a war is upon us, whether we like it or not: either they destroy us or we destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131745;Chinese Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131745;\n\nThe call has come from the capital: the era of warlords is over, and all the Chinese peoples must unite under a single flag. This means $COUNTRY$ must either submit to Beijing's rule or face more war against a strong and unified foe. Your generals stand ready to receive your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131746;The Island of Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131746;\n\nNow that we own the island of Formosa, the local Min population has begun to organize itself -- presumably towards the end of breaking away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316089;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316089;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has won its war against us. Now their generals walk into $CAPITAL$, gloating with their superiority. It seems that, should they force us to the negotiating table to demand yet more concessions, we will have little choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316090;The Treaty of Shimonoseki;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316090;\n\nWe have won a great victory against $FROMCOUNTRY$. Now we must consider -- do we negotiate with them, perhaps promising the return of some of their land in exchange for the island of Formosa and reparations? Or do we stay our current course and perhaps alarm the Western nations at our advances into $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316091;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316091;\n\nWe have won a great war against $FROMCOUNTRY$. Now we are faced with a dilemma: do we force the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government to the negotiating table, perhaps promising the return of some of their land in exchange for a treaty port and reparations? Or do we stay our current course and perhaps alarm the other great powers at our advances into $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316092;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316092;\n\nAs we thought, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ infidels have forced a so-called 'treaty' upon us, demanding a great deal of reparations and land concession -- in return for land they currently possess but have no more right to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME152009874;The Destruction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC152009874;\n\nHeavy street fighting erupts in the small streets of Paris as $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces advance into in a bid to capture the city. Artillery is moved to the Chaillot Hill, past improvised barriers while infantry run away from the 7th arrondissement and move systematically from house to house, block by block, fighting a running battle against armed irregulars. The Arc de Triomphe is demolished by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ pioneers while the artillery in Chaillot hill set their sights on the Eiffel Tower. For several minutes the city is taken by the roar of artillery until silence falls and the only sound is the screeching of retorted metal slowly bending. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shout excitedly as they watch the Eiffel Tower bend and fall into the Seine, now reduced to an amorphous lump of metal. \n \n Fires rage out of control in the eastern parts of the city, lighting up the skyline as the fighting continues into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME152009875;The Fall of the Palace of Westminster;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC152009875;\n\nScattered gunfire can be heard echoing through the empty streets of London as the last pockets of resistance to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ occupation are quelled. The parliament houses in the Palace of Westminster lay empty while $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers run up and down placing explosives in the silent corridors. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ general silently read the orders that came from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital with instructions to destroy the Palace in an attempt to crush the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ spirit. The explosives are detonated at the same time as the Clock Tower bell strike its precise hourly strike. The tower is engulfed by flames as parts of the western palace collapse, with pieces of the Big Ben landing on the Thames along with other debris while nearby buildings are hit by flaming debris and catch fire. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers watch and cherish from a safe distance as the glass that once contained the phrase "DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM" rains on the ground. Nearby, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers storm the Buckingham Palace just to find out that the $MONARCHTITLE$ has already fled the country. They hoist the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ flag and turn to see the smoke rising in the horizon. London is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1000;\n\nKarl Marx has published The Communist Manifesto, which has led to workers in $COUNTRY$ to found a party dedicated to advancing the agenda laid out therein.

EVTDESC1001;\n\n'Comrades, it is a great fact that the misery of the working masses has not diminished from 1836 to $YEAR$ in $COUNTRY$, and yet this period is unrivaled in the development of its industry and the growth of its commerce. Capital is dead labor, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks. The time during which the laborer works, is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labor-power he has purchased of him. As time passes, all social rules and all relations between individuals are eroded by a cash economy, avarice drags Pluto himself out of the bowels of the earth. In light of this, we want, no, we NEED a free society, where no one is considered to be superior, no one is left behind and where mankind is free from oppression and scarcity. We need a society without a government, without class divisions and where the workers control the means of production. \n The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.';;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Radicals are the revolutionary avantgarde of the liberal ideology, and they will not hesitate to use whatever means necessary to see their ideas of freedom and free trade instituted both in $COUNTRY$ and abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME32537;The Rise of Mysticism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32537;\n\nImperial Russia is confronted with a religious renaissance, a widespread interest in spiritual-ethical literature and non-conformist moral-spiritual movements, an upsurge in pilgrimage and other devotions to sacred spaces and objects. The "God-Seeking" are shaping their own ritual and spiritual lives, sometimes in the absence of clergy. The upper class of $CAPITAL$ has been widely influenced by this wave of mysticism. Individual aristocrats are reportedly obsessed with anything occult and this new fever for anything mystic has been spreading to the middle class and the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME32538;The Tzar's Son Falls Ill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32538;\n\nIn $YEAR$, Tsesarevich Alexei, the Tzar's son, received an injury which caused him painful bleeding. When the doctors could not supply a cure, the desperate Tzarina looked for other help. Grigori Rasputin, a peasant who identified as a strannik, a religious wanderer, had already treated other nobles families and came for the desperate Tzarina. Rasputin was said to possess the ability to heal through prayer and was able to calm the parents and to give the boy some relief, in spite of the doctors' prediction that he would die. On the following day the boy showed significant signs of recovery. The careless Alexei received the last sacrament during another particularly grave crisis, and the desperate Tzarina turned to her lady-in-waiting, to secure the help of the peasant healer. The next day, Rasputin responded and sent a short telegram, including the prophecy: "The little one will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much." The boy's temperature dropped and the hematoma disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT32538OPTA;Well, I will be damned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32539;Intrigue in the Russian Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32539;\n\nWhile fascinated by Rasputin in the beginning, the ruling class of $CAPITAL$ became envious and turned against him: he had privileges no one else had. In $YEAR$, within four months, Rasputin had visited the Romanovs six times. The press started a campaign against Rasputin, claiming he paid too much attention to women. Hermogen, who told Rasputin to stay away from the palace, repeated the rumors that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a sect. Iliodor, hinting that Rasputin was Alexandra's paramour, showed Makarov a satchel of letters. The letters were handed to the Tzar and Rodzianko requested Rasputin to leave the capital. When Kokovtsov became prime minister he asked the Tzar permission to authorize Rasputin's exile to Tobolsk, but Nicholas refused: "I know Rasputin too well to believe all the tittle-tattle about him." Kokovtsov offered Rasputin 200,000 rubles for him to leave the capital, but he refused. Rasputin had become one of the most hated persons in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Russian nobility and clergy rejoices, arguing that the Tzar made the right choice. Rasputin only looked the Tzar in the eyes, and said "Before we repent, we have to sin.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME32541;Russia Goes to War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32541;\n\nDespite attempts to convince the Tzar, Rasputin stayed in court. Iliodor, one of the main orthodox priests, had Khionia Guseva attack Rasputin. She stabbed Rasputin in the stomach, just above the navel. Covered with blood, Rasputin was brought into his house. The Tzar sent his own physician and after a laparotomy and more than six weeks in the hospital, Rasputin recovered. From the hospital Rasputin sent quite a few telegrams to the court, expressing his fears for the future of the country: "If Russia goes to war, it will be the end of the monarchy, of the Romanovs and of Russian institutions." In $YEAR$, Tzar Nicholas took supreme command of the Russian armies, leaving his wife in charge of ruling the country. Alexandra loathed the Duma because of its discussion of Rasputin. While seldom meeting with Alexandra personally, Rasputin had become her personal adviser through daily telephone calls or weekly meetings with Vyrubova.

EVTNAME32543;Rasputin's Assassination;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32543;\n\nTwo city policemen on duty near the Yusupov palace heard shots and screams. They discussed the issue on the Pochtamtsky Bridge. One of them rang at the door and questioned Yusupov's butler, but was sent away. Twenty minutes later he was re-invited to the palace. Purishkevich boasted he had shot Rasputin, and asked the policeman, aware of his mistake, to keep it quiet for the sake of the Tzar. Rasputin's beaver-fur coat and the body were discovered in a frozen river, 140 meters away from the Bolshoy Petrovsky bridge, with a shot in his frontal lobe. The two nobles who killed Rasputin were exiled by the Tzar, who came back from the front. Progressively, more and more people came to the conclusion that the problem was not Rasputin but the weak-willed Emperor, who had secluded himself in Tsarskoye Selo, unable to react on what happened. The struggle between the Tzar and the Duma became more bitter than ever, and the Tzar, more secluded in his palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT32543OPTA;A gruesome end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32544;The Communist Plot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32544;\n\nEveryone who met Rasputin remarked on his eyes and how hypnotic they were. His "shining steel-like" or "bright and brilliant" and "intelligent" eyes became legendary. According to Theofan, Paul Kurlov and Count Kokotsov he had "piercing" eyes. To Tamara Karsavina he had the eyes of a maniac. But his hypnotic eyes couldn't do anything against the bullet of one of the members of the Communist Party who believed he could destabilize the government by killing a close friend of the Tzar's family and the Tzarina most trusted advisor. The Russian nobility rejoiced at the death of Rasputin, assassinated as he left his home, but the death had the inverse effect that his assassin expected: the Russian Tzar left his isolation and ordered a hunt. The police organized a crackdown in every syndicate or communist party/organization, severely crippling communist support and organization, and rounding up a few suspects including a prominent figure in the communist circles, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32545;Attempt on Rasputin's Life;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32545;\n\nDuring a visit to his home village, while exiting a church, Rasputin was attacked by a man. The man stabbed him in the belly three times before Rasputin managed to escape, running down the street with his hands on his belly. The man chased him, but Rasputin grabbed a stick from the ground and hit him on the head. Covered with blood, Rasputin was brought into the church. After ten hours a doctor arrived from the neighboring village and operated on him in the middle of the night. Rasputin stayed days under heavy guard and the man who attacked him was never found, but he recovered. He started drinking, his paranoia increased and eventually he asked to leave the service of the Tzar, which he did despite the Royal family protesting, and lived the rest of his life as a hermit. Nobles still went looking for him, asking for advice, and after he left his public image was somewhat redeemed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rubble falling into channels led to flooding in parts of the town, while others were set ablaze by the lamps. Five thousand perished in the tragedy. Two thousand homes, the colonial-era town hall and the Basilica of San Francisco were leveled, the remains burning to ash in the ensuing four-day fire.

Following the plan designed by the engineer Julio Balloffet, the city was rebuilt in a new nearby place, located approximately 1 kilometer to the southwest, and the authorities moved to the new seat shortly after. The design of the new city was intended for the rapid evacuation of the inhabitants in the face of a new seismic emergency. For this, wider streets and a greater number of squares were designed, which would serve as a quick refuge for the neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97112;\n\n"La Revolución del Parque" (The revolution of the park) was an uprising against the national government of $COUNTRY$ that took place on July 26, 1890, and started with the takeover of the Buenos Aires Artillery Park. It was led by members of the Unión Cívica against the presidency of Miguel Juárez Celman of the Autonomista Nacional Party. Though it failed in its main goals, the revolution forced Celman's resignation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36706;\n\nIn 1865, Father Damiaan De Veuster, a priest from Tienen in Brabant, departed with a ship to the island of Molokai in Hawaii to aid the lepers colony there. Many natives are being infected by diseases such as influenza, brought by foreign sailors and traders. Other diseases, such as the currently incurable leprosy, also affect a great part of the population. Father Damiaan plans to work and live with the lepers on Molokai for many years, showing true dedication to aiding those in need even though this trip may be considered a death sentence for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
URUGUAYLOST;\n\nOnce again Uruguay has attempted to liberate themselves from our rule, resulting in a humiliating defeat. After the failed revolt in Montevideo, a great debate has arisen in $CAPITAL$: the fate of Uruguay. Although there are many ideas, our options come down to two: integrate them officially as a province of $COUNTRY$ or grant them independence under strict $COUNTRY_ADJ$ supervision. What shall be done with the rebellious Banda Oriental?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
URUGUAYWON;\n\nWe have succeeded in our fight for independence against the Argentines and, in $YEAR$, we have proclaimed a Uruguay free from foreign domination. It is now time to celebrate this crucial victory for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME899089;Formation of the Shishi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC899089;\n\nA band of politically-inclined ronin discontent with the Shogunate has formed. The Shishi, or "men of higher purpose," hail primarily from Satsuma, Choshu, and Tosa, and they are prepared to take violent action to thwart Shogunal policies that would further put Japan under foreign influence. This is to say, not all of the shishi explicitly support bringing the Shogun down. But all of them believe a change of course in foreign policy is necessary to save Japan from foreign domination. To this end, they are willing to engage in terrorism, no matter the cost to national stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The prominent group of discontent ronin known as the Shishi has plotted violence in Kyoto in order to promote the cause of the Emperor's restoration to power. Last night, they convened at the Ikedaya inn in Kyoto, where they were ambushed by the Shinsengumi. The ensuing confrontation saw the two groups in intense battle within the inn.

EVTNAME899094;The State of the Modern Shogunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC899094;\n\nJapan has changed, yet it also seems the same as usual. In a race against the clock to modernize its military and social institutions to protect itself from Western imperialism, it has established a Prussian-esque semi-constitutional monarchy, and has otherwise adopted the government institutions of a modern country. Daily life, however, continues more or less as it did during Japan's isolated era. The Shogun is still a supreme military ruler, and the conflict of his agenda with that of the Emperor has not disappeared. Meanwhile, the populace has continued to maintain a severe distrust of all things Western, except the newfound wealth brought to the upper class from industrialization. Social mobility continues to be stifled by the divide between the peasant and samurai classes, which are inherited, mutually exclusive statuses. Both classes seek prestige and higher wages by either joining the national army or the Shinsengumi police force. In short, it's a status quo the Japanese people have been used to for hundreds of years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT899094OPTA;Let us rejoice, though, that Japan is stronger than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME899095;The Assassination of Sakuma Shozan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC899095;\n\nSakuma Shozan, also known as Sakuma Zozan, was a scholar of European technology and military strategy. Single-handedly, he studied the works of European scientists and engineers, then adopted their machines' schematics to create his own technology. His machines ranged from electrical generators to clocks to Japan's first telegraph. He also was a staunch advocate for opening Japan's ports to Western trade, which made him an enemy of the Shogunate. In $YEAR$, he was murdered by a group of assassins for his belief that the Emperor should move his castle to Hikone province, which roused the ire of the pro-Shogunate Hikone and Aizu clans. For the few who share his pro-Western convictions, he is a martyr. They would be sorely disappointed if the Emperor did not take heed to Sakuma's ideas after his passing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT899095OPTA;May the heavens grant him eternal rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CORRIENTESSCHIZO;\n\nDuring our righteous war against the savage federalists, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces have finally occupied Entre Rios and reached the Parana Delta. The province has been assigned to be governed by a local unitarian, who will also rally troops and lead them to fight against Rosas' regime. However, the province of Entre Rios is largely federalist, and the local population will certainly be angered and might attempt to revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRTUNIFICATION;\n\nWith Rosas unable to defeat the Corrientes rebellion, Colonel Astrada has assumed control of the government. Meeting with other unitarians in the country, they have drawn up a new constitution for Argentina. The Argentine Confederation was abolished and replaced by the unitarian-led Argentine Republic, with Genaro Berón de Astrada as president while the former Governor and President, Juan Manuel de Rosas, was forced to flee the country and is now exiled in the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7749112;Resistance to New Japanese regime;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7749112;\n\nFederal Japanese government officials have been hard-pressed to get the former daimyos and the samurai class to accept the new regime. There is a good deal of the population who are skeptical, if not hostile, to our rise to power. They prefer a return to the old ways of feudalism--and they are channeling their foolish nostalgia through civil unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7749112OPTA;They will get used to us, eventually.;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7749113;Resistance to the New Japanese Regime Dies Down;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7749113;\n\nWith a new high standard of living, modernized industry, and a prevailing sense of hope for Japan's future, the Japanese people are quickly adapting to our rule. They are no longer openly resisting the government, and instead are voicing their contentment with the direction of their newly modernized nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME666605;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Launches Invasion of Manchuria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC666605;\n\nTheir victory in the Russo-Japanese War has emboldened $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces to invade Manchuria. This is the latest step in their expansion of holdings in northeastern Asia. If they are able to annex Manchuria, what will that mean for our country's security in the future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743340;Bloody Sunday;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743340;\n\nWith our military's reputation being tarnished due to recent defeats, unrest has begun blanketing the peasant class of Saint Petersburg, sparking protests against larger socioeconomic inequality. Led by Georgy Gapon, a pro-Tsarist priest with a particular sympathy toward the poor, a crowd of unarmed protesters marched onto Narva Gate and attempted reaching the Winter Palace to address the Tsar. They carried the Imperial banner to signify their support of the Tsar, simply wanting to talk to him. The Tsar was not at the palace. The Imperial Guard, unprovoked, responded to the crowd by firing upon them. Up to 234 civilians were killed, up to 800 injured, and 6,831 arrested. \n\nThis massacre has disastrous implications for the monarchy. With it now established that the Imperial Army is not afraid to fire upon the Tsar's loyal subjects, the Russian people have no reason to believe the monarchy represents them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743341;Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich Assassinated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743341;\n\nThe peasant unrest grows more and more severe, claiming its latest victim within the Russian royal family--the Grand Duke, Sergei Alexandrovich. Ivan Kalyayev, a terrorist from the Revolutionary Socialist Party, stalked the Duke as he rode a carriage through the Kremlin. When the carriage crossed through Nikolsky Gate, Kalyayev threw a nitroglycerin bomb directly into the Duke's lap. The explosion instantly killed the Duke and mutilated his body almost beyond recogntion. \n\nSergei is remembered for his extreme methods putting down revolutionary movements. He was not afraid to shed the blood of hundreds of Russian subjects to maintain the Tsar's rule. With him gone, the budding anti-Tsar revolution can claim new heights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743342;The Lódz Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743342;\n\nThe Poles of Russia are joining in on the revolutionary fervor. Facing the same economic suffering as other Russian peasant subjects, as well as suppression of Polish culture and the Polish language under Russification, agitators have begun a violent uprising in Lódz. The uprising was supported by Polish socialists, though was notably opposed by the National Democrats. Wishing instead to promote cultural unity with Russians and increased Polish political representation, the National Democrats collaborated with the Imperial Army to put down the rebellion. Nevertheless, nationalist and socialist agitation is now spreading across Poland--a specter haunting the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7749114;The Council of Elders' First Session;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7749114;\n\nThe newly established Japanese national assembly, the Council of Elders, is meeting officially for the first time. The Council has been addressed by our leader with opening remarks about Japan's continued modernization, as well as the need for our new government to establish its legitimacy in the people's eyes. He ponders his words as he speaks, as if coming to terms with the new contradiction he is presented with as he takes on his new office. The Sonno Joi movement cast him as a leader of a new order meant to bring Japan to new heights, a liberal icon. Yet as a religiously-appointed sovereign, his authority is by no means a hallmark of liberalism. Which faction should our ruler come out in support of? What will be exact words?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7749116;Kiri-sute Gomen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7749116;\n\nThroughout pre-modern Japan, samurai had the right to kill peasants whom they perceived to have insulted their honor. The practice was known as Kiri-sute Gomen, literally the "right to cut down and leave [the victim's body]." Today, however, in an age of both revitalization and re-analysis of tradition, the practice has become controversial. \n\nIn the streets of Tokyo, a particularly grisly instance of Kiri-sute Gomen occurred when a samurai kicked a peasant to the ground and stabbed him through the heart. The incident unfolded directly in view of a House of Elders member, who was disgusted by the act. He has thus brought the old right to the House of Elders for a vote on its repeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756224;Japonisme;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756224;\n\nThe West has always shown curiosity in the customs of the East. Their exoticness--their non-Christian faiths, their unique art--both inspires and bewilders viewers who are accustomed to the established traditions of Western culture. Japanese art and culture has now reached a new height of popularity in the West. Romanticists, impressionists, and the generally curious have begun using Japanese-inspired styles, painting Japanese subjects, and even mimicking Japanese fashion sense through donning kimono. The trend of obsession with Japanese culture has been termed "Japonisme." This trend is a double-edged sword: while many Westerners genuinely appreciate our culture, some do so out of a morbid curiosity about what they perceive as an exotic, uncivilized nation--a society attempting to match the West's greatness with their curious traditions. Nevertheless, we will use Japonisme to cement our cultural dominance worldwide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756225;The Shinsengumi Turn against the Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756225;\n\nTrends toward liberalism and the political left have turned the Shogun-loyalist Shinsengumi, currently serving as Japan's elite police force, against our government. They are highly nationalist, seeing our modernization as an unjust drift toward emulating the West rather than differentiating us from them. They believe our government's reforms contradict Dentoudou: we claim to preserve our traditions while undermining the old order of our society. They have issued a warning: if we continue to drift leftward, they will start a rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756226;The Shinsengumi Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756226;\n\nThe Shinsengumi has declared that our rule is now illegitimate in their eyes. They have declared war on the Shogun, inciting sympathizers in the army to engage us and topple the government. Kansai is now a hotbed of reactionary fervor and violence. Japan has entered its second civil war in this century.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756227;The Shinsengumi's Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756227;\n\nWith our army struggling to contain the rebellion, the Shinsengumi has seen it fit to submit their demands. They wish to install their leader, Hijikata Toshizo, as the new Shogun. Additionally, they wish to revert the Shogunate to an absolute monarchy, giving the Shogun free reign to enforce an isolationist, traditionalist agenda. They have only vaguely specified the Emperor's role in their new government: some speculation is to be made about whether he will continue as speaker for the House of Elders or take on an entirely new role. If the Shinsengumi get their way, they will be given free reign to roll back modernization reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756228;The End of the Shinsengumi Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756228;\n\nThe Shinsengumi are demoralized and have stopped fighting. The Shogun emerges victorious, and our victory has led to reactionaries nationwide losing organization and political relevance. The Shogunate has now disbanded the Shinsengumi and will purge the army of their sympathizers and collaborators.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743343;The $YEAR$ Russian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743343;\n\nWe now have the opportunity to solve the question plaguing our politics today: the fate of Russia's absolute monarchy. Should the $YEAR$ Constitution pass, Russia will become a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliamentary system. The federal legislative branch will include two assembly bodies: the State Council, consisting half of Tsar-appointed officials and half elected by the people, and the State Duma, entirely composed of elected representatives. This is a last resort to prevent the Tsardom's total destruction. Then again, the Tsar still steadfastly holds on to the belief that the Russian people are too unintelligent to know how to represent themselves. If we break our promise in the October Manifesto to establish this constitution, we may spare the Tsar some peace of mind--at the cost of guaranteeing a huge uprising down the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743344;The Moscow Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743344;\n\nA socialist-communist coalition of rebels have descended upon our great city of Moscow. While the new constitution was able to satisfy liberals, who demanded expanded political rights, socialists and communists were left dissatisfied because of unsolved worker's rights issues. The rebels were brought to action by the rousing words of Vladimir Lenin, the infamous Marxist leader himself, who called for an armed uprising. The preparations for this uprising were in place shortly afterward, and the catalyst for the revolt came when the Saint Petersburg Soviet communist group's members were all arrested. \n\nBefore violence broke out, though, about 2 million Moscovites went on strike peacefully, After police violently intervened, rebels clashed with them, then carried out attacks on the Guard Ministry and the Kremlin itself. Moscow is a war zone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743345;The Nizhni Novgorod Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743345;\n\nA factory uprising in Nizhni Novgorod has ballooned into a revolt engulf the entire city. After workers from multiple left-wing groups, including the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries, prepared improvised weapons from industrial steel and gathered guns from donations, they clashed with the military and turned the city into a war zone. The rebels seem to have taken inspiration from the Moscow Uprising. We suspect that the left-wing unrest could create more uprisings in a chain reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743346;The Rostov Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743346;\n\nThe Moscow Uprising's chain reaction has led to another uprising, this time in Rostov. Left-wing worker rebels have engaged the police and military throughout the city after first occupying the city railway station, resulting in the rebels being bombarded with artillery. The violence has also spilled into the neighboring city of Taganrog--where military-trained workers squads are mobilizing against Tsarist troops. Both cities are engulfed in continued warfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743347;Uprisings Engulf Ukraine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743347;\n\nSocialist and communist elements in Ukraine have risen up, creating several breakaway "republics" instating policies they demand all of Russia to implement. In Kiev, students and factory workers declared a socialist "republic" in the neighborhood of Shulyavka. They called for an end to monarchy, expanded social programs, and an end to Jewish pogroms. In Gorlovka, more than 4,000 factory workers took up arms against Tsarist forces, protesting decreased wages. Similar violence erupted in Priluki and Yekaterinoslav as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BUCHANAN;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government are proposing that our current overlapping claims on the Puna de Atacama region be resolved via arbitration with United States minister to Argentina, William Buchanan, mediating the conflict. If we were to accept this proposal it is possible some of our claims might be awarded to $FROMCOUNTRY$. However, this arbitration is our opportunity to set a fixed border in the region and prevent a war. While we may lose some of our claims, it is also possible we are awarded our rightful lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743348;The Stary Buyan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743348;\n\nUnrest from militant socialist and communist elements has led to a daring measure being made by the village of Stary Buyan, in Samara. Known for being a revolutionary socialist hotbed since the 1880's, the peasant village has declared itself an independent socialist republic. The "republic's" leaders know this secession is mostly symbolic, since the Russian army's might would easily crush them. Nevertheless, they hope the Tsar will take heed to the budding socialist revolution's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743349;The Krasnoyarsk Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743349;\n\nA second symbolic secession from $COUNTRY$ has occurred within the city of Krasnoyarsk. After a general strike by the local workers, continuing a trend of strikes originating in Moscow, armed worker's squads formed to enforce the demands of the newly formed Krasnoyarsk Worker's Soviet. The Soviet established an assembly of 120 leaders to consolidate its organization. The Soviet's smooth rise to power was quickly quashed, however, when armed workers battled reactionaries as a pogrom was carried out in the Krasnoyarsk's downtown. \n\nAll that's left to wonder: which city will be the next to rise up?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-EVTNAME743350;The Sochi Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743350;\n\nSocial Democratic and Communist elements have declared a Soviet Republic in Sochi and Gelendzhik, Krasnodar Krai. Under violent retaliation from Tsarist forces, the two cities are embroiled in open warfare. The rebels, however, became numerically superior to the local police garrison and now have forced the government to send in the army. We may as well consider this conflict another civil war with a breakaway state, part of the continued anti-Tsar revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME743351;The Latvian Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC743351;\n\nSpirited by the Moscow uprising, Latvian workers have declared a general strike and subsequently clashed with police. Their demands, echoing those of other striking workers in Russia, include increased pay and increased autonomy for the Baltic states. The uprising was spearheaded by the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party, which advocates for the Russian Empire's split into a decentralized union of autonomous states. They greatly resent Russification and the cooperation of Baltic Germans with Russian authorities as Latvia's autonomy is continuously undermined. Violence has become especially severe in Ventspils and Valmiera.;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIEDMASHEEP;\n\nThe cities of Viedma and Carmen de Patagones have been economically diversified since their foundation, and export various different products, aside from being mostly self-sufficient. However, there has been a recent amount of sheep coming from Buenos Aires, and this might be an opportunity to exploit the wool business in the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7433532;The Mutiny of the Battleship Potemkin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7433532;\n\nAmidst the chaos erupting from the leftist elements in Crimea, the Battleship Kniaz Potemkin Tavricheskiy, or Prince Potemkin of Taurida, has gone rogue. The crew mutinied after morale plummeted due to the Russian military's repeated losses and the resulting disruption of supply lines, which forced the crew to eat borscht rations made from rotting meat. When the crew refused to eat the rations, Ippolit Gillarovsky, the ship's second in command, threatened to shoot them. In the aftermath, a showdown between the ship's officers and the other crewmates erupted and caused seven of the thirteen officers to be killed. \n\nThe Potemkin is now without any naval command, on to parts unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7433533;Battleship Potemkin's Crew Takes Refuge in Constanta;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7433533;\n\nThe Russian Battleship Potemkin has landed in our waters, the crew seeking refuge from the upheaval in their native country. This presents us with a dilemma. Should these sailors seek refuge here and become civilians? Should they be offered enlistment in our own navy? Or, should we return them to Russia in hopes we avoid a diplomatic row with them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7433534;Battleship Potemkin's Crew Takes Refuge in Constanta;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7433534;\n\nPotemkin has been sighted on the shores of Constanta. It is confirmed that the crew is seeking asylum in $FROMCOUNTRY$. In the midst of our constant unrest, it may be wise to let this incident go, though there is always the opportunity to demand military retaliation if we are so inclined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7433535;The Potemkin's Crew has been Repatriated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7433535;\n\nThe Potemkin's mutinous crew has been repatriated graciously by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities. They will be summarily prosecuted, and the Potemkin will go back into service under a new crew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7433536;The Potemkin's Crew has been Repatriated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7433536;\n\nOur military action in order forcibly repatriate the Potemkin's crew was successful. The mutineers will be summarily prosecuted, and the Potemkin will go back into service under a new crew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7433537;The Potemkin Shells Odessa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7433537;\n\nAfter the crew mutinied and killed seven of its thirteen officers, the Potemkin has arrived again in Russian waters to deliver sailors attending the funeral of Grigory Vakulinchuk, one of the mutiny leaders. The Russian army then ambushed the attendees and arrested them. In the chaos, crewmembers on the ship retaliating by bombarding the army. Odessa is now under martial law, with the electrical grid cut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756229;Japanese Warship Visits Manila;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756229;\n\nJapan's modernization and resistance to the West is now an oft pointed-to inspiration for Philippine revolutionaries. The positive relationships our diplomats have cultivated with the Katipunan have led to us being a role model for the struggling colony. As a result, the battleship Kongo has arrived on a goodwill trip in Manila to greet the revolutionaries. Behind closed doors, however, rumors are circulating about arms deals having been brokered between us and the rebels. Spain has heard of this and now looks upon us with great suspicion. \n\nOpenly allying the rebels can help us further our cause of greater Asian sovereignty. However, it's also tempting to exploit the rebels by kicking out the Spanish together and taking the islands for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756230;The Japanese-Philippine Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756230;\n\nThe Katipunan now has a powerful new ally: $FROMCOUNTRY$. Japanese officials confirm that the nation's military will support the rebels as part of a global campaign for Asian sovereignty. This certainly means imminent war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756231;Spain Threatens War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756231;\n\nSpanish officials have responded to our alliance with the Katipunan with a warning that war would break out immediately should we not retract our alliance. We have no intention of doing so. It is time for Japan for strike at one of its Western rivals and come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756232;What Shall We Demand from Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756232;\n\nVictory over Spain yields us plenty of options to make demands from them. We initially declared our alliance with the Katipunan intending to fight for Asian sovereignty. However, our geopolitical interests in southeast Asia make it tempting to assume control over the Philippines ourselves, betraying that alliance. One thing is clear, though: Spain can no longer have a foothold in the Pacific. We will need to seize their islands in Micronesia to create a buffer around the Philippines. \n\nNote: If Spain does not own Palau, Saipan, Guam, or any other Pacific islands, they will not be ceded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756233;Japan Presents their Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756233;\n\nJapan demands that the Philippines be freed from our rule, and that our surrounding Pacific possessions be ceded to Japanese control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756234;Japan Presents their Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756234;\n\nJapan demands that the Philippines be freed from our rule and be placed under their appointed puppet government. Furthermore, all our Pacific island territories surrounding the Philippines will be ceded to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756235;Japan Presents their Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756235;\n\nJapan has performed a dramatic turnaround in their policy regarding the Philippines. Betraying their alliance with the Katipunan to fight for the colony's independence, they demand that the Philippines and all other Spanish-held Pacific islands be annexed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756236;Our Demands to Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756236;\n\nConsidering the disgraceful aggression Japan has displayed toward us, we have drafted a harsh but fair set of demands. They will pay us £200,000 in reparations and cede to us all outlying islands within their realm--including ones close to their major population centers. We will take the Ryukyus, Tsushima, and Sado.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756237;Spain Presents their Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756237;\n\nAfter their victory over us, Spain demands our total withdrawal of diplomatic relations with the native Philippine people, and that all our outlying island territories be ceded to them. This includes the small islands closest to our largest regions, including the Ryukyu islands, Tsushima, and Sado.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756238;The Caribbean Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756238;\n\nWord of our defeat by Japan has reached Cuba and Puerto Rico, leading independence activists to immediately stage a revolt against Spanish rule. They waited for the perfect opportunity--a moment when our army is reeling from a major defeat and unable to protect our remaining overseas possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756239;Aftermath of Revolutionaries' Defeat in the Caribbean Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756239;\n\nThe revolution has been crushed. Cuban and Puerto Rican nationalists have temporarily laid down their arms, but continue to spread pro-independence sentiment among the colonies' populace. To stop the indepndence movement from rising up again, we need to continue ruling over the Caribbean territories with an iron fist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756240;Korea Revolts after Japanese Loss to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756240;\n\nAfter our humiliating defeat at Spain's hands, the Korean people have taken to open revolt to throw off the chains of our colonial rule. They sensed our military's weakness, unable to defend our foreign territories, and launched the revolt by storming government buildings across the peninsula. Korean former soldiers in our army distributed arms to as many able-bodied men as possible, while women and children took to the streets with Korean flags while chanting the independence slogan "Daehan dokrib manse!" The Japanese government has lost its ability to govern the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756241;Shall we Intervene in Korea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756241;\n\nThe troubles in Korea continue to roil as pro-independence forces clash with the Japanese army. The conflict engulfs the land and signals a point of great Japanese weakness. Should they lose Korea, Japan will be stripped of its strategic position in north-east Asia. This gives us the opportunity to reassert our dominance in the region. Korea is valuable as a buffer state between us and Japan--and the more loyal they are to us, the better. Shall we send troops to help the Koreans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756242;Russia aids Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756242;\n\nOur troops are now fighting two enemies in the Korean War of Independence. Russia has begun sending troops and materiel to support the Korean revolutionaries, hoping to rebuild Korea as an independent state blocking us from military access to continental Asia. The war has not developed in Japan's favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756243;Shall we Intervene in the Caribbean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756243;\n\nSpain's defeat at the Japanese's hands has led to revolutionaries in Cuba and Puerto Rico revolting, striking during a perfect opportunity at a point of peak Spanish weakness. The Monroe Doctrine obligates us to keep Europe from interfering in Latin America, which is our backyard. We could honor the Doctrine by declaring war on Spain. This will allow us to advance the cause of Latin American sovereignty, or possibly exploit the rebels to get territorial concessions from the Spanish. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756244;What Shall we Demand from Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756244;\n\nOur victory against Spain during our intervention in the Caribbean yields us some options for profitable demands from them. We can guarantee independence for the Spanish West Indies, or we could either vassalize or annex them directly--betraying our alliance with the revolutionaries. The choice is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756245;Filipinos Respond to the Japanese's Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756245;\n\nMidday yesterday, Katipunan members marched to the Spanish governor general's building to proclaim victory over the Spanish, escorted by Japanese troops. By the time the Katipunan fighters reached the steps, however, the Japanese troops pushed them aside and blocked off the entrance. Pamphlets circulated the city within a few hours containing a startling message: the Philippine Islands would become subject to full Japanese jurisdiction, and all independence fighters were to surrender their arms and announce their allegiance to the Japanese government or face deportation. A shootout occurred between indignant resistance members and the Japanese troops at the Governor General building, which then led to skirmishes breaking out nationwide. \n\nThe Philippines have succumbed to a devilish ruse from a supposed ally. They ask Japan: "Have they no shame?";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756246;Cubans and Puerto Ricans Respond to the Americans' Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756246;\n\nThe populace of Cuba and Puerto Rico have reacted poorly to coming under American rule. After our troops marched into the Spanish capitols in Havana and San Juan and declared the islands are now under US jurisdiction, independence advocates gathered outside and began rioting. Led to believe we would fight for their independence, they feel betrayed. They are not wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756247;The Americans Submit their Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC756251;\n\nThe Korean revolutionaries are battered and demoralized, but their convictions stay the same. It will take a long while before Koreans as a whole are willing to submit to Japan as their legitimate overlord. Meanwhile, the colonial government slowly is returning to authority, with heavy backing from the army. We must be ever vigilant to avoid another revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756252;The United States Intervene in the Caribbean Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756252;\n\nAmerican troops have disembarked to engage our forces in the West Indies, providing backup for the Cuban and Puerto Rican rebels. There's no doubt the United States wish to exploit the revolt for their own gain, possibly to get territorial concessions out of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAYPACTS;\n\nThe Pacts of May, four protocols proposed in Santiago de Chile by Chile and Argentina on 28 May, 1902 in order to extend their relations and resolve its territorial disputes, are being negotiated. The pacts include selling off warships already in construction in Europe and working towards resolution of territorial disputes. If we were to sign these protocols, we could possibly lose part or all of our disputed claims on the Andes. However, refusing them could lead to possible war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANDESCASE;\n\nThe governments of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and Argentina find themselves in a dispute over their borders in the southern Andes mountain range. Argentina claims it lies along the highest peaks of the mountains, while Chile's claim states the border to follow the fluvial watershed. Both countries have signed an agreement to end this dispute on friendly terms, and we have been contacted to arbitrate this dispute. Who shall the land go to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWAUSTRALIA;\n\nWilliam Lane, an Australian socialist, along with some 240 settlers, has come to our nation in the search to create his very own socialist utopia. The settlers were required to pay a minimum of 60 pounds to join the colony, and the small settlement has already begun to be formed. While Lane's strange ideals could prove dangerous to the safety of $COUNTRY$, it is unlikely anything will come of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWGERMANIA;\n\nA group of impoverished Saxon families from Germany, led by Bernhard Förster, have emigrated to $COUNTRY$ in the search of a place to found a utopian settlement in order to practice ideas regarding Aryan supremacy and the like. While these ideas could prove dangerous to our country, they are nothing more than a few colonists, and their development of the land could prove useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756253;Answering the "Imperial Question";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756253;\n\nThe Emperor is the center of an underground, but still significant, debate in Japanese politics. He may not hold the title of absolute ruler anymore, but that does not stop the former rebels of the Sonno Joi movement from still insisting he must overtake the Shogun as Japan's sole monarch. In pre-modern times, the Shogun was supposed to act as commander in chief of the Japanese army, while the Emperor tended to all other affairs. Of course, this has not been the case in several hundred years, ever since the rise of the samurai rulers of old. \n\nThe wave of instability culimating in the Shinsengumi Rebellion has led to the "Imperial Question" being asked again. Is the Emperor really best kept as Speaker of Parliament? Should he be charged with a greater duty? Or, should he be stripped of power to keep this debate from ever coming up again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756254;A New Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756254;\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Elders, the Emperor is a significant figure in Japan. He guides the House to vote on matters of state with some independence from the Shogun. However, he too is checked and balanced out by the government branches both above and below him. He cannot call upon policies directly, but he certainly can advocate for them--and, perhaps, form a voting bloc of members who share his personal political beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756255;The Japanese Dual Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756255;\n\n"It is not enough anymore for me to stand alone in the highest office of the land," declared the Shogun. "We can only reconcile with those who do not believe I have the right to rule by giving up some of that power to our Emperor. We are not enemies--not anymore." The Shogun addressed Japan in a speech where he declared the Emperor his co-head of state. As was standard hundreds of years ago, the Emperor will now be tasked with domestic matters, addressing the concerns of the Japanese people, while the Shogun prioritizes military and diplomatic affairs. Japan has reinvented itself yet again--or, rather, revived its former self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756256;Emperor Returned to Ceremonial Role;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756256;\n\nDrastic measures have been taken. Seeking to squash the source of unrest in Japan once and for all, the Shogun has privately ordered the Emperor to step down from power, returning again to a ceremonial role. The Emperor departed for the old Imperial Palace in Kyoto inconspicuously, in civilian's clothes to avoid being recognized, then issued a statement confirming he has relinquished power. He has said in this statement that he believes that stepping down is necessary to prevent another civil war. The following day, the Shogun himself stood to address the House of Elders and declared himself head both of the executive branch and legislature. There remains to be seen what comes of this new development in Japanese history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME756257;The New Imperialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC756257;\n\nGradual build-up of the Japanese military now leads our people to wonder: if we are not making war, why do we arm ourselves? Hawkish members of the Council of Elders have begun pushing for a new policy of "Seifukuron," or "Doctrine of Conquest." They say that if the samurai have no one to fight, they will become disloyal to the government. This echoes the ambitions of the daimyo Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who in the late Sengoku period unsuccessfully led a campaign to conquer Korea and China. He did so to distract the samurai from his terminal illness and lack of a legitimate heir. Can Japan today follow in Toyotomi's footsteps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC6765859;\n\nFollowing the Hungarian Revolution, a similar but smaller uprising already began brewing in Prague. Only 3 days ago, Prague students met in Karolinum and sent a request to general Windisch-Grätz, demanding that the army, which was monitoring the situation from its deployment around the city, withdraw. After being denied their demands, the students spread the contents of their letter as a leaflet around Prague, stirring up the populace. The uprising has begun in earnest today, with peasants building barricades and fiercely opposing government troops. Our forces had no choice but to retreat and Prague is now controlled by the rebels. The rabble now demand that we grant the Czechs greater autonomy. While this would pacify them, it would also lead to even greater discontent in other Slavic areas. §RWe must act quickly should we decide to quell the rebellion to prevent its spread to other Czech provinces!§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6765860;\n\nToday Muslim residents of Aleppo, largely from the eastern quarters of the city, rioted against Christian residents, mostly  located in the northern suburbs of Judayde and Salibeh. Aleppian residents originally protested against the threat of conscription, and marched to the palace of Mustafa Zarif Pasha, the governor of Aleppo. The rioters then advanced to the predominantly Christian quarters, where they began to loot and pillage both churches and private homes, killing anyone found inside. Do we intervene on behalf of the Christians or let the events run their course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC5858548;\n\nToday, a mob attacked a group of sailors on shore leave from the cruiser USS Baltimore outside a bar in the Chilean port of Valparaíso after one of the American sailors spat on a picture of Arturo Prat, one of Chile's national heroes. Two sailors were killed and eighteen were injured. The Chilean government must pay for the victims and structural damage or face the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

abdulaziz_expeditioneur_desc;Ottoman sultans have never traveled to Eastern or Western countries except for campaigns, and only a few have traveled around the empire. Moreover, it is exceptional for Ottoman sultans to go on pilgrimage. Our Sultan, Abdülaziz, has never been in foreign lands. However, due to recent events, our Sultan has decided to break the Darül- Harp (Abode of War), and travel to Europe for diplomatic reasons. The journey has been thoroughly discussed in the palace, and finally a solution has been found. Special compartments built under sultans shoes will be filled with earth so that Sultan Abdülaziz would not step on foreign lands in the countries he visited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME30092;The First Aliyah;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC30092;\n\nFollowing through with the Zionist idea of resettling the land originally part of the Kingdom of Israel, Jewish immigrants have come to Palestine to seek a new life. They are making what is called in Hebrew "aliyah," or the return of Jews to their ancestral homeland. The Zionist movement's representatives have petitioned $COUNTRY$ to officially agree to permitting the free migration of Jews to Palestine to achieve this goal. Jewish immigrants already have moved to Palestine throughout the early 19th century and even before for religious reasons and to escape persecution, but this is the first time they have come as part of a political, nationalist movement. These new immigrants come in small numbers now due to Zionism being relatively unknown, but it's doubtless that they will soon arrive by the thousands and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME30093;The First Zionist Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC30093;\n\nIn $YEAR$, pioneer Zionist Theodor Herzl convened with his followers to finalize the agenda of the Zionist movement. The assembly was officially named the First Zionist National Congress. Having originally planned the event in Munich, Germany, it was moved to Basel due to fierce opposition from the local Reform and Orthodox Jewish populations, who believe the Biblical return to the Promised Land can only be led by God. Nevertheless, the Congress was held, and Zionist leaders agreed to fully pursue the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME30094;The Rise of Palestinian Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Arabs have begun to vocally oppose the Zionist project, becoming increasingly fearful of their complete marginalization in the land they've called their home for hundreds and hundreds of years. Zionist leaders, meanwhile, have taken a firm stance against any attacks on the local Jews and have adamently rejected prospects of regulating Jewish immigration to protect Arab residents, who find themselves evicted to make way for Jewish settlers. Zionist leaders' main concern clearly is settling as many Jews as possible, which they believe should not require the consent of Arab political leaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME30095;The Nebi Musa Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC30095;\n\nArab militancy in $COUNTRY$ has reached a boiling point, resulting in perhaps the largest incident of inter-communal violence between them and the Jews since the Balfour Declaration. On the Easter Sunday festival of Nebi Musa, between 60,000 and 70,000 Arabs gathered in the Old City of Jerusalem to protest Palestine's colonial rule and facilitation of Jewish immigration to the land. Crowd members chanted antisemitic slogans and soon attacked Jewish residents. The colonial gendarmerie forcibly broke up the riot and instated a curfew, but failed to adequately protect Jews from rioters. Members of the Jewish paramilitary group Irgun, led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, requested to reinforce colonial troops, but the offer was declined. Consequently, Irgun troops tried to intervene on their own but found themselves unable to pass through the Old City's walls. More pogroms are doubtlessly on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME30096;The Establishment of the Kibbutzim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC30096;\n\nRecent Jewish migrants are increasingly publicly showing support for socialist and communist causes. In hopes of establishing a socialist state in the Land of Israel, many have begun constructing communes known as kibbutzim. Residents of a kibbutz share all resources and are assigned work according to the needs of the community as a whole. If the Jewish homeland is destined to be a socialist nation, guaranteeing the livelihood of all based on shared wealth, who are we to oppose it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC30097;\n\nWith a generation of Jewish settlement having passed, the Arabs of $COUNTRY$ have reached a point of unrest that has resulted in the bloodiest violence since the start of the Zionist project. Conflict between Jewish and Muslim groups over access to the Temple Mount, a site holy both to Judaism and Islam, occurred earlier this month. However, the main spark of violence occurred when a Jew was stabbed to death by an Arab in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim. Gunfire soon broke out at the Temple Mount as Arabs descended on Jews in the Old City to massacre them. Waves of similar attacks raged on in all major cities. The Jews in turn retaliated through random acts of violence and property damage, following the principle of eye-for-an-eye. \n\nThis is the point of no return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELFRAREVWTH;\n\nBefore the French Revolution a movement of radical-democratic republicans was active who wanted to dethrone King Leopold I, some by force. When the Revolution in France started, they mobilized and set up to do the same here. With the cooperation of the new republican government in Paris, thousands of Belgian guest workers were gathered and taken to Belgium on three trains. The intent was to arm them before the border and create a trail of revolution by associating themselves with local agitators and masses in the towns they passed. Thanks to infiltrated groups, we were informed of the preparations for it. The armament in France was partly prevented and one of the trains was defused. After a fierce firefight, the arrival of artillery was decisive and the republicans were dispersed at Risquons-Tout. Meanwhile, from Bruges to Virton, local riots and revolts were suppressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16121914;\n\nThe Naturalist on the River Amazons is a newly published book by the British naturalist Henry Walter Bates about his expedition to the Amazon basin. Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution by natural selection, as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored thousands of miles of the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start, he also describes animal behavior, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18481988;\n\nA derailment occurred today at 16:00, when the GranvilleParis Express overran the buffer stop at its Gare Montparnasse terminus. With the train several minutes late and the driver trying to make up for lost time, it approached the station too fast and the driver's application of the train air brake was ineffective. After running through the buffer stop, the train crossed the station concourse and crashed through the station wall. The locomotive has fallen onto the Place de Rennes below, where it stood on its nose. Although the passengers survived, a woman on the street below has been killed by falling masonry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATTRAINWRECK;\n\nA train wreck occurred today in Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania, between Camp Hill station and Fort Washington station. Two trains, traveling on the same track in converging directions, collided, killing between 59 and 67, and injuring over 100. The incident is now referred to as The Camp Hill Disaster in Montgomery County, and The Picnic Train Tragedy in Philadelphia. It's now the deadliest railroad catastrophe to date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3171811;\n\nDiscontent has built up over the years and unrest was to expected. The revolution of February 1848 in Paris has caused a wave of revolutions throughout the Europe which pose a threat to the Luxemburg monarchy. The protest began in form of petitions to authorities. Their extent was unusual, to the effect that 70 petitions were sent in March alone, which had been drafted and signed spontaneously. These petitions originated from towns across the country, indicative of the widespread discontent. Now, a popular uprising has begun with its center in Ettelbruck in the North of the country. Today, angry citizens declared a republic and sang the Marseillaise in spirit of the French revolution. A crowd gathered and blocked the way for the gendarmes when they appeared on the scene, trying to provoke them to use their firearms. Fearing expansion of the revolt, we have sent new forces to Ettelbruck, as a fair will take place there tomorrow. A revolution has begun: let's hope that it fails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

lux_constitution_1848_desc;After a deadly Revolution, we have been forced to write a new constitution. It has been written in a very liberal spirit. It establishes a balance of legislative and executive powers in that it conferres an important place on the Chamber of Deputies as a legislative body and as a body of control of the executive power. In addition, it proclaimes fundamental rights and freedoms, such as equality before the law, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press. With the demands of the Revolution fulfilled, our country can be in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

lux_coup_1856_desc;In a speech from the throne, the Governor of Luxembourg, Prince Henry, announced the amendment of the constitution, which he claimed was required to bring it into line with the rest of the German Confederation. Our constitution is too liberal, and it has to be reverted. The liberals in the Chamber are outraged, and demand that any changes respect the freedoms won in the Revolutions of 1848 and the independence of Luxembourg from the Netherlands, which was in a personal union with Luxembourg. We could ignore the liberals' opinion, which don't have much power in the chamber, and revert it anyway. That could provoke a new Revolution though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18481989;\n\nA coaldust explosion, the cause of which is not known with certainty, has devastated a coal mine operated by the Compagnie des mines de houille de Courrières today, causing the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France. A large explosion was heard shortly after 6:30 AM. An elevator cage at Shaft 3 was thrown to the surface, damaging the pit-head: windows and roofs were blown out on the surface at Shaft 4: an elevator cage raised at Shaft 2 contained only dead or unconscious miners. Rescue attempts have begun quickly, but are hampered by the lack of trained mine rescuers in France, and by the scale of the disaster: some two-thirds of the miners in the mine at the time of the explosion have perished, while many survivors suffer from the effects of gas inhalation. This disaster is the worst mining accident to date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18481994;\n\nToday Poles around Tarnów have revolted against serfdom, directed against manorial property and oppression. The recent poor harvests resulted in significant unrest among the local peasantry. The crownland (province) of Galicia is the largest, most populous and poorest province in the Austrian Empire, and is disparagingly known in Vienna as Halbasien (Half-Asia), a province the Austrian officials regarded dismissively as "a barbaric place inhabited by strange people of questionable personal hygiene". Even Poles refer to the zone jokingly as Golicja and Glodomeria (Naked and Hungry). With the recent Kraków uprising, the peasants' rebellion has been ignited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18481995;\n\nAfter not stopping the Galician slaughter, our aristocrats in the area rebelled against our rule. We have to rally an army to stop this at this instance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC35401;\n\nYears ago there was a violent anti-government demonstration which took place at the end of the Third Italian War of Independence. It was organized by disappointed former partisans (who had joined the 'Thousand' after their landing and those who had followed Giuseppe Garibaldi in Aspromonte in 1862). Today the growing misery of the population, cholera and its 3,977 victims in the city and district have taken the final blow to the Palermitan: Thousands of people rose up, many armed, from neighboring villages. Nearly 4,000 rebels attacked the prefecture and police headquarters, killing the inspector general of the Public Security Guard Corps. The city is now in their hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC35403;\n\nKing Umberto I today had an attempt made on his life as he was accompanied by his wife, son, and the statesman Benedetto Cairoli. While riding in an open carriage through the procession of a Naples parade, he was attacked by the knife-brandishing anarchist Giovanni Passonante, who yelled as he assailed the King: "Long live Orsini! Long live the universal republic!" Umberto was able to fend off Passonante until an officer of the royal Curassiers Regiment subdued him. Cairoli, meanwhile, was wounded in the thigh as he attempted to shield Umberto. \n\nThis attack is the culmination of the left's seething opposition toward Umberto, who loathe him for his social conservatism. As expected, protest marches both supporting and opposing the attacker have broken out nationwide. It is crucial at this point, shortly after its birth, that the monarchy be protected from the growing political blocs who wish to see it die in its crib.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC35404;\n\nAnother assassination attempt against Umberto I was made today again by an anarchist terrorist. His attacker, Pietro Acciarito, waited amongst a crowd within the Campanelle Hippodrome racecourse in Rome, then charged at the King's carriage with a knife upon its arrival. Umberto was able to dodge the attack, his swiftness having been honed from his familiarity with assassins. Acciarito was sentenced to life in prison. \n\nThe court adjudicating Acciarito's trial attempted to find proof of a larger anti-monarchist conspiracy he was part of. However, Acciarito denied this, insisting he acted alone. The Italian police nevertheless has rounded up anarchist and socialist elements on suspicion of collaboration. None of these arrests have turned up evidence proving Acciarito was not a lone actor. Acciarito's actions have provided a spark for anti-monarchist demonstrations again to break out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31746;Queen Isabella today narrowly survived an attempt on her life by a rogue priest. While she was attending a mass of thanks for the safe delivery of her child, the priest and liberal agitator Martín Merino y Gómez waited for her as if intending to deliver her a message, then tried to stab her to death. The knife, thankfully, caught on the stays of Isabella's dress, saving her from a fatal wound. Merino was arrested on the spot and imprisoned to be executed later. Our liberal and anti-monarchist populations have clearly grown out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31748;\n\nQueen Isabella is ready for marriage, and Britain and France have taken opposite sides on whom to support as her potential husband. Ever since the War of Spanish succession a century ago, France has desired to unite her crown with the Spanish one under the Bourbon dynasty. As such, they support marrying her off to Francis, Duke of Cádiz, her second cousin. However, the British object based on the 1713 Peace of Utrecht, which prohibits the French from appointing a candidate to the Spanish throne. Britain instead supports her marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a member of the current British royal house. Whomever is chosen will bring Spain closer to the country promoting either candidate. The decision is best left to the discretion of our government. \n\nWhat, you thought Isabella had a say in this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31749;\n\nPeasants and day laborers' discontent is being channeled into a revolt in the municipalities of Sevilla province. Growing social inequality has led to demands for lower costs of living as well as more radical demands such as the abolition of the monarchy. The laborers have burned down estates, chanting "Death to the rich," and attacked the Civil Guard in El Arahal and Utrera, leading to open warfare. Eventually, however, Spanish troops surrounded them as they engaged them in Serranía de Ronda and captured their military leaders, executing them by firing squad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16121915;\n\nThe Cape Town Railway & Dock 0-4-2 has begun operation today. It is the first railway system in South Africa supporting tender locomotives. A modest stretch of track, it is only able as of now to transport cargo and passengers a total of 1 and a half miles between Cape Town Station and Salt River. But for the railway to become open to the public now means that South Africa's rail system is destined only to grow further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6765861;\n\nGreek entrepreneur Nestor Gianaclis has begun a foray into the tobacco industry by founding a factory in Alexandria. Using imported tobacco from Turkey, his ambitious business project seeks to get exploit the high demand for cigarettes and introduce Western tastebuds to an Egyptian-style smoke. Gianaclis' business has the potential to attract fellow Greek tobacco merchants to Alexandria and, in turn, give our economy some much-needed diversity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6765862;\n\nDespite faring somewhat better in Eastern Muslim lands compared to Europe, the Jews of the Orient are still vulnerable to persecution. One example unfolded just recently. After Italian monk Tomaso de Camangiano and his Muslim boy servant went missing in Damascus's Jewish quarter, local gentiles assumed the Jews kidnapped them and murdered them to use their blood in matzo bread. This notorious lie, nicknamed the 'blood libel' and commonly used since the Middle Ages, led the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to investigate. The investigation indeed resulted in bones being found in the sewers below the Jewish quarters, but no forensic analysis was done to confirm whose they were. Jews were then rounded up and interrogated, with one prisoner confessing under torture to the murders along with seven other men. The aftermath has seen Christians and Muslims terrorizing the Jewish quarter: synagogues destroyed, shops vandalized, people beaten in the streets. Jews the world over, meanwhile, united by their conviction to end their people's suffering, have rallied to condemn the persecution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC7562598;\n\nJapan's economy is not quite geared yet to creating a global demand for our goods and services. Yet with times constantly changing and businesses growing increasingly ambitious to attain untold riches, the economy may well yet reshape itself to compete with the largest of trade powers. Ready to take up this mantle are the zaibatsu: family-owned conglomerations holding a wide variety of companies. Their holding companies are in turn funded by investment banks, allowing the zaibatsu to easily create monopolies if they grow large enough. The Japanese government may easily take advantage of the zaibatsu to carry out tasks more efficiently than national institutions can, such as tax collection, supplying the military, and guiding foreign trade. The question is: should we? Will the zaibatsu be at the center of Japan's economic future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123689;\n\nA massive pogrom occurred in Mashhad today at the behest of the city's leader. Upon his orders, Muslim residents have attacked local Jews, burned down their synagogue, looted their homes, and abducted girls and women. This violence was motivated by a desire to rid the population of non-Muslims: many Jews were pressured into renouncing their religion and publicly converting to Islam, appearing in public as openly Muslim but continuing to practice Judaism secretly at home. Others fled the city for nearby Herat. The brutality has been warmly received by Persia's Muslims, with the event being dubbed "Allahdad"--or "God's Justice.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC30099;\n\nOur nation has occupied and annexed the Golan Heights, or "Ramat Hagolan" in Hebrew. This land was once part of the tribe of Menasseh, with the ancient city of Golan being one of the six Levitical cities of refuge. It was an inseparable part of the Israelite domain, and it should be treated as part and parcel of our modern nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC38507;\n\nAustralian pearls were first gathered by Aboriginals, soon attracting the interest of colonists. Now, in $PROVINCENAME$, they have begun a full pearling industry using Aboriginals as forced labor. Their job is perilous and many die of shark attacks, storms, disease, maltreatment and the bends. Still, the pearling business is immensely profitable: A virtual gold rush has begun, with colonists from all over swarming to $PROVINCENAME$ to get in on the pearl business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC30098;\n\nIn the wake of riots in nearby Jerusalem, the previously peacefully coexisting Arab and Jewish people of Hebron have had their relations irreparably damaged. Hebron, a Jewish and Muslim holy city known for housing the Cave of the Patriarchs, became the site of a pogrom. False rumors about Jews carrying out the "wholesale killing of Arabs" were spread, leading Arab rioters to attack Jews on the streets, in synagogues, and at the town's yeshiva. \n\nAshkenazi Jews were particularly targeted because of them being perceived as foreign colonizers, unlike the local Sephardic Jews, who are well assimilated and speak Arabic. In total, 12 Sfaradim and 55 Ashkenazim were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31000;\n\nThe Jews of $FROM$, beleaguered by a hostile Arab population that will not let up on attacking them to prevent the founding of the Jewish state, are now demanding independence.

On the Easter Sunday festival of Nebi Musa, between 60,000 and 70,000 Arabs gathered in the Old City of Jerusalem to protest Jewish immigration to the land. Crowd members chanted antisemitic slogans and soon started attacking Jewish residents. The gendarmerie forcibly broke up the riot and instated a curfew, but failed to adequately protect Jews from rioters. Members of the Jewish paramilitary group Irgun, led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, tried to intervene on their own but found themselves unable to pass through the Old City's walls. More pogroms are doubtlessly on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31004;\n\nThe unorganized resistance to the Zionist project has officially broken out into a military conflict. With outrage in the Arab world over the relinquishment of land by the Palestinian Arabs to Jewish settlers, all hope of a shared sovereignty between Jews and Arabs in the land of Israel has been lost. Gunfire broke out as Arabs ambushed a bus carrying Jewish immigrants. As Jewish forces attempted to mobilize and prevent further attacks, the Arabs' intentions were made clear: they plan a full overthrow of Jewish sovereignty, seeing it as a settler colonial project intended to erase the Arab presence in the land. If they succeed, they will surely attempt to expel and massacre our land's Jewish inhabitants, as they have already recently.\n\nCome what may of their endeavor, we are prepared to show that, as people with ancient roots here, our ancestral right to sovereignty in Eretz Yisrael will not be taken from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31006;\n\nOver the years, a modest Jewish neighborhood built on the outskirts of Jaffa has grown into a city in its own right, attracting thousands of immigrants to settle within. Originally named Ahuzat Bayit, the town was been renamed Tel Aviv, after the Hebrew name of Theodor Herzl's seminal Zionist work Altneuland . With Jewish immigrants flocking to a city whose mayor, Akiva Arieh Weiss, intends to give all the virtues of modern Western civilization, Tel Aviv has become a metropolitan counterpart to the ancient port city of Jaffa and has overtaken its population. Tel Aviv today is the pinnacle of Klal Yisrael's national revival: a cultural capital of the Jewish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31007;\n\nThe defeat of the Palestinian insurgency has left local Arabs in a panic over their livelihood. By the scores, they have fleeing their homes in panic as the Haganah and other Zionist paramilitaries launched assaults on their villages, or out of anticipation of attacks. Some have even been expelled for the military's expedience, such as in the towns of Lod and Ramle. The events of this Palestinian mass flight will inevitably be a source of indelible tension between the Jews and Arabs throughout the region, since the depopulated villages the Arabs have left behind will doubtlessly be resettled by Jews, and the Arabs will most likely not be allowed to return so as to ensure a Jewish majority and prevent a fifth column from continuing to exist in the Jewish State. Their flight will erase most of the visible presence of Arabs in the Land of Israel.\n\nWe fought for our freedom and won, but at what cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MARCH1STMOVEMENT;\n\n"We herewith proclaim the independence of Korea and the liberty of the Korean people. This we proclaim to all the nations of the world in witness of human equality. This we proclaim to our descendants so that they may enjoy in perpetuity their inherent right to nationhood."\n\nSince March 1st, approximately 2 million Koreans have participated in 1,500 individual protests against Japanese rule. The movement came as a long-coming powder keg of civil rest in Korea, a nation with an ancient history that has been totally subsumed by Japan. Despite their resolve to see their liberation through, the demonstrations were largely peaceful until the Japanese police lost the ability to control the crowds and sent in the military. The result has been massacres of Korean protesters by the thousands. Nevertheless, Koreans remain undeterred, ready to continue organizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600358;\n\nA light rain complements a lively rally in Chicago's Haymarket Square for eight-hour work days. To an estimated 600 to 3,000 disgruntled workers, the progressive leaders August Spies, Albert Parsons, and Rev. Samuel Fielden give igniting speeches enumerating the grievances of workers who toil for long hours for paltry pay, barely enough to feed themselves or their families. After Fielden's 20 minute speech, however, police begin to amass around the rally and call for it to disperse, moving in to forcibly clear the premises. Suddenly, a homemade bomb is thrown at the police, killing seven officers. Pandemonium ensues: a flurry of gunfire is exchanged between police and protesters, and officers even fire upon fleeing unarmed civilians. The media has concluded that the workers threw the bomb, while progressive activists state it was a police mole who threw it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HELVECIA;\n\nIn recent times, a fair amount of Swiss immigrants have been arriving on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands to seek a better life. While most have settled in the large cities and areas of growing population density, some families seek to work the fields in Santa Fe instead, with some remarkable foundations regarding a colony named Helvecia. Provided we sell them a lease of land in the near-barren areas of the province, they could help develop the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MOISESVILLE;\n\nJewish refugees from Kamianets-Podilski fleeing persecution are seeking to immigrate to $COUNTRY$. Initially thinking to settle an area of inner Buenos Aires province, the price of the land has risen and has made it impossible for them to purchase the properties in the area. Some aristocrats have offered an area of land around Santa Fe to the settlers, but this land has not met their expectations. They are currently living in deplorable conditions. Their plight has come to the attention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs--we could help the colonists thrive with some economic aid, although it would be expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FISHINGMARCHIQUITA;\n\nFollowing the boom around the southern coast of Mar Chiquita, there have been talks of encouraging the small but growing fishing industry around the Miramar area. Although it could be beneficial, this also could end catastrophically and plunge the region into poverty if not handled correctly. Instead, a safer choice could be made: funding the Quebracho tree lumber industry on the lake's islands and coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEVELOP_PARANA;\n\nThe plan to develop the Mesopotamia into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ heartland was a success, but there is still more to be done. The regions adjacent to the Paraná river are not as developed as their immediate neighbors, creating a difficult contrast. There are proposals in $CAPITAL$ to extend the development plan to nearby regions. These could, however, be quite pricey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NONAKBA;\n\nWith the Palestinian Arab insurgency defeated, the Arabs of Eretz Yisrael have been left deathly afraid of their future in their homeland of over a millennium. To secure the right for Jews to continue settling the land, and to prevent a fifth column from forever being present in Israel's borders, the Haganah's high command all expected an order to come to expel the Arabs or encourage them to leave. Such a command, however, never came to reality. The Arabs of the villages most affected by the conflict have not fled in panic, but have chosen determinedly to stay.\n\nZionist leaders have instead put their energy into building trust with Arab leaders. Haganah forces oversee the reconstruction of Jewish and Arab communities alike. Jewish towns' mayors negotiate with Arab mukhtars about resources and the state's future budget for both communities. There is still general distrust between Jews and Arabs due to their opposing aspirations for self-determination in the same land. However, steps toward reconciliation are rapidly being made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OLEGABRIELSORENJAABAEK;\n\nRural farmers, typically of poor background, are increasingly getting involved in Norwegian politics. This phenomenon is thanks to the rise of leaders representing the country's common people, such as Ole Gabriel Ueland and Søren Pedersen Jaabæk. Ueland started his political career as a farmer with no formal education, eventually coming to represent the district of Stavanger Amt in the Storting. He is respected for his advocacy for farmers' welfare. Jaabæk, in addition to now representing Lister og Magdals Amt in the Storting, has founded the Bondevennerne, a political advocacy group for peasants named after a similar organization in Denmark.\n\nNorway is entering a new age of social progress. May the country and its people thrive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It might be worth it to comply, lest we prolong this war and further embarrass ourselves globally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YANBIANKOREANS;\n\nEthnic Koreans have migrated to Manchuria in large numbers since the start of the 19th century, becoming a dominant ethnic group especially within the south of the region. Within recent years, however, Koreans have begun infiltrating into Manchuria in larger numbers than ever before to escape famine in our country's north, mainly Yanbian province and its surroundings. Yanbian province specifically is part a once disputed territory called Jiandao, claimed by us until 1712, when a treaty with the Qing demarcated our borders along the Tumen River. The number of Koreans in Jiandao has led to an interesting development: they claim that their demographics alone ought to make the land Korean soil. China intends to deport these migrants, and we must step in to protect them. Perhaps this means we ought to reassert a claim to Jiandao--or Gando in Korean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC9899815;\n\nAfter our victory in the Austro-Prussian war, several Great Powers were alarmed after our severe peace deal against the Prussians and started to make plans to organize a coalition against us, however, the British decided to solve this problem by organizing a meeting in London which several European Powers attended. After much debate over the fate of Germany and Central Europe, it was agreed to force us into a compromise that would demand several concessions in Central and Eastern Europe, including the loss of all non-German territories in exchange for our complete control over Germany. Namely, Western European powers demanded the creation of a large independent Hungary, while Galicia-Londomeria would be handed over to the Russians as an autonomous region, and predominantly Italian territories would be ceded to Italy. The only loser in the conference was France, whom the Great Powers denied any chance to annex territory on the left bank of the Rhine, land which France has either once controlled or aspired to control since Napoleon's reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9899819;\n\nAfter the Prussian defeat and the expulsion of the Prussians from Berlin, several Great Powers reunited in London to discuss about the fate of Germany and Central Europe. At the end it was agreed that Austria must give up its ethnically non-German lands and suffer several concessions from their neighbors. However, our demand for everything on the left bank of the Rhine was outrageously rejected by the other powers, leaving us with no territorial gains whatsoever by the conference's end. But maybe we can organize a lesser concession for the southern part of the left bank of the Rhine, however, it all depend on the Austrian response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9899820;\n\nFrance has demanded concessions in the Rhine's southern east bank as compensation for our victory against Prussia. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1929MURCHISONEARTHQUAKE;\n\nThe north of New Zealand's South Island was hit by a high magnitude earthquake today at 10:17 AM, creating widespread damage. The quake occurred within an epicenter around Nelson, Greymouth, and Westport, at a 12-kilometer focal depth. The surrounding region suffered large enough damages to lay ruin to roads, buildings, and bridges alike, within an estimated 26,000 square kilometers. 14 of the 17 resulting deaths resulted from landslides, while the other two souls perished in a coal mine collapse. Locals also report that the quake created a new water fall 8 kilometers southwest of Murchison, at the end of the Maruia River.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
1931HAWKESBAYEARTHQUAKE;\n\nThe earth continues to shake unpenitently and drag the people of New Zealand into the ground, burying them alive. At 10:47 AM, in the eastern North Island, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck that killed 256 and injured thousands. The Hawke's Bay region was utterly destroyed, thousands of its people suddenly thrust into homelessness.\n\nThe quake has been called the worst natural disaster in New Zealand's history. That label certainly does not feel premature--the destruction has even caught the King's attention, who telegraphed the Governor-General a message sharing his condolences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7449115;\n\nThe ascension of the Emperor to the sole Japanese sovereign currently is not taken lightly by China and those under its sphere of influence. Korea, for example, has refused to recognize the use of the word "Tenno" to describe the Emperor, which implies ceremonial superiority to the Korean King and equality with his overlord, the Chinese Emperor. Hawkish nobles have insisted we use this diplomatic row as an opportunity to send a punitive expedition to Korea and flex our military might. It would provide jobs for unemployed samurai and distract them from their dissatisfaction with the new regime. But is a war over such an easily reconciled misunderstanding worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
EVTDESC20605626;\n\nJapan has voiced total outrage at the result of a diplomatic mission to our country, which resulted in the death of the ambassador Saigo Takamori. Shortly after arrival in Korea, Saigo had been scheduled to meet with several Joseon bureaucrats to discuss relations between our countries. He arrived at this meeting with a katana in hand, then striking at the bureaucrats without provocation in a fit of inexplicable rage. A retainer restrained and then killed Saigo. All Japanese diplomats have resultantly been expelled from our kingdom. Japan, however, refuses to claim responsibility for Saigo's behavior, instead insisting that his treatment under Korean hospitality was "inhumane" and "barbarous." We suspect Saigo's behavior was intentional--that he acted on Japan's orders so they may claim a casus belli. Come what may of this war, we will fight to the last man for our security and sovereignty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUCHAMPFOUNTAIN;\n\nA most unusual piece of "artwork" has appeared at New York City's inaugural exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists. The work, credited to Frenchman Marcel Duchamp, is a dismounted urinal placed on a wooden column, signed on the front with the pseudonymous signature "R. Mutt" and the year 1917. Duchamp presented the work as a "sculpture," whose purpose reflected how everyday objects may be "raised to the dignity of a work of art by the artist's act of choice."\n\nThe Society did not reject the work, as Duchamp paid the submission fee. However, they refused to display it at the exhibition. The sculpture's existence would come to light when photographer Alfred Stieglitz captured a photo of it at Manhattan's 291 Art Gallery. The work remains there as a curiosity--forcing the viewer to examine what even constitutes a piece of art.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
