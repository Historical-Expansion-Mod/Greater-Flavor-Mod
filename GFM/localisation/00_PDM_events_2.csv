EVTNAME20110;Natives in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20110;A recent demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought attention to the plight of natives in $STATENAME$, namely to their oppression by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and their demands for independence. If something isn't done soon we may be facing intervention by foreign powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20111;Trouble in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20111;A recent riot in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought a great deal of attention to $STATENAME$-- the kind that would normally prompt the great powers to consider intervention. It seems, however, that the demands for independence by 'uncivilized' peoples has largely fallen on deaf ears. News of the trouble has faded away as quickly as it began.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20112;Long Memories;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20112;While recent trouble in $STATENAME$ has raised the spectre of foreign intervention once again, there are many who remember the last crisis over $STATENAME$'s people as if it were yesterday. Try as they might, the world is simply not ready to listen to them again-- yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20115;Incident in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20115;A demonstration by $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ quickly got out of hand as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shot into the crowd to disperse it. A riot ensued, and several protestors were slain. Throughout $STATENAME$, the reaction has been one of outrage-- and there is an effort by some $PROVINCECULTURE$ malcontents to draw the attention of the world, just one more example of $COUNTRY$'s disregard for peace and civilized behavior-- or so they'll say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME32520;The Eastern Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32520;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings in Okhotsk and Kamchatka, and we must seek to claim these lands before the Japanese do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME32521;Treaty of Shimoda;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32521;Vice-Admiral Yevfimy Putiatin has sailed from Russia to $COUNTRY$ on a mission to establish formal relations and to define the borders between our respective territories. After months of negotiation, we have agreed to open three ports to Russian merchants and to guarantee Russian ships access through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ waters and straits. Both sides have agreed that our borders in the Kuril Islands lay just north of Etorofu, and propose to share sovereignty over Sakhalin Island. The finished treaty was signed on February 7th, $YEAR$ in Shimoda.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA32521;May our empires prosper together!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME32522;Trouble in Sakhalin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32522;Conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian and Japanese claims, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. There are several solutions we could propose: first, we could officially divide the island between us and Japan, essentially legalising the status quo. This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return. This would hurt our reputation, and it would badly offend the Japanese, who would probably refuse. How should our diplomats proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32523;It seems that conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. The Russian recently approached us, all smiles and willingness to co-operate. They have offered to make the current status quo official: Sakhalin will have a border drawn dividing it in two. Considering the fact they could have forced the issue, it seems they want us to be friends rather than enemies.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32524;It seems that conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia. On the other hand, if we insist on the status quo, we will keep our present territory but risk escalating the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC32525;It seems conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have outrageously demanded that we give them full control of Sakhalin, in exchange for nothing! Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin. If we give in, we will lose a promising colony and look weak to other nations. But, if we insist on the status quo, the conflict is likely to escalate into open war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME32526;Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32526;The Japanese have refused our proposal, and they now insist that they will settle for nothing less than the present division of Sakhalin. We can back down and accept the status quo, or we can use force to get our way. If we accept the status quo after reaching for more, we will look weak to the other Powers, though relations with Japan will be preserved. But, our only other option now is to declare aggressive war for the islands, which will hurt our reputation abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME32527;Treaty of Saint Petersburg;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32527;The treaty has been signed! Our borders in Sakhalin and the Kurils are now settled, and ships from both empires have been guaranteed access through the Strait of Tartary and the Sea of Okhotsk. This should ease tensions in the region considerably and ensure close diplomatic ties between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32528;The war for Sakhalin is lost! Russia has been compelled to acknowledge Japan's sovereignty over the south of the island. One day, we will make this right--- but, for now, we are beaten.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32529;The war for Sakhalin is won! We have successfully defended ourselves against Russia's misguided aggression, and the Russians have been forced into a treaty acknowledging Japanese sovereignty. Peace has been restored to Sakhalin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32530;The war for Sakhalin is won! Russia has enforced its rule over the entire island, and the Japanese have been forced into a treaty renouncing their claims. Peace has been restored to Sakhalin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME33030;The German East Africa Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33030;The Society for German Colonization has been attempting to colonize the Zanzibar coast for several years now, having formed the German East Africa company and signed several treaties with Swahili tribes. It now seems they are facing difficulty with rebellions and have asked us to step in. The Sultan of Zanzibar will doubtlessly object if we do, as he claims authority over the coast-- even if his actual authority is minimal-- but so what if he does? This may be an interesting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME33031;German Warships!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33031;For the last several years, Swahili tribes on the coast have been making treaties with Europeans, allowing them to create small settlements. We knew this would be trouble, and we were right. Powerful warships have arrived from $FROMCOUNTRY$, a demonstration of their power as they make a demand for the entirety of the coast. If we do this, they say, we shall be safe from further molestation-- and they claim we do not truly control the coast anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME37235;The Algerian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37235;Not long ago, Algerian bitterness towards Ottoman rule made them almost welcome French intervention. Our colonization of Algiers and the northern coast, however, has given rise to a resistance under the leadership of Emir Abdel Kadir. The man has united the Maghrebi tribes, and now has launched attacks on several colonial settlements.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97570;Native Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97570;Now that $COUNTRY$ is free, native $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens are beginning to protest against the colonial regime that still remains. Foreigners still hold the highest positions in the government, and have a privileged status in comparison to those they once ruled over as a colony. In $PROVINCENAME$, the recent arrest of a native for trespassing on the estate of a foreigner has led to riots-- and dissension has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97666;The Rebellion is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97666;Saigo Takamori is dead-- some say he committed seppuku after receiving a wound-- and the rebellion he inspired is now ended. To many, this was the last gasp of the ancient samurai? and a new way for $COUNTRY$ on the path of progress now lies ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97680;The Sakhalin Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97680;Japan has quarreled with Russia before over the rule of Sakhalin Island. Now, our influence in China and Korea has led to renewed friction between our nations. The Line of Advantage dictates that we must extend our control over the whole of Sakhalin and establish a stronger northern border. But are we willing to risk war with a European power?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97681;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97681;The warmongers in the Japanese government are now demanding that Russia cede Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands entirely to them. To give up so much territory without a fight would make us look very weak, but Japan's might has grown tremendously in recent decades. Can we risk a war in the Pacific?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME99000;The Righteous Harmony Society;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99000;'Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreign!'/n/nMany Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society-- known to foreigners as 'Boxers'-- has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99001;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99001;An attack upon a foreign merchant in $PROVINCENAME$ has signaled the arrival of the Boxer movement to $STATENAME$. Already the flags of the Righteous Harmony Society have been spotted, their followers recruiting fellow Chinese to support the Qing government in their struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99005;Attack on Foreigners in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99005;Throughout all of $STATENAME$, the Boxers are attacking western influence. Smugglers, missionaries, opium peddlers? anyone they can apprehend is being slain or forced to flee for their lives. We have a choice: either look the other way, risking anger from the great powers for these 'atrocities', or send in forces to suppress the Boxers and risk the anger of our own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99006;Boxer Atrocities in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99006;A group of Chinese nationalists known as the 'Boxers', intent on driving all western influence out of $FROMCOUNTRY$, have attacked a group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several were slain, while others were forced to flee for their lives. Worse, the Qing government has done nothing about it. They are looking the other way while these atrocities are being committed upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99010;Boxers Attack Legation Quarter!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99010;The Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners-- and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME99011;Boxers Attack $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99011;The Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozes of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk. The Qing government has looked the other way, an act that is seen by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as a declaration of war. Many are calling upon us to intervene in order to protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens from these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99015;The Boxer Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99015;We are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ generals and representatives from all the great powers. The Righteous Harmony Society will be forcibly disbanded, its leaders executed or imprisoned, and our government is once again humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99016;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has submitted to the intervening powers, signing a treaty that promises to forcibly dismantle the Boxers and pay reparations for the atrocities committed in their name-- and explicitly supported by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900640;The Cyprus Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900640;An idea has arisen within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: could we perhaps offer our support to the Ottomans in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for a lease on Cyprus? Our support could make a great deal of difference for them... and the island's proximity to Suez makes it of strategic importance. The Ottomans could use all the support they can get, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with a proposal: they will lend their support to us in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for Cyprus. The island's proximity to Suez makes it of strategic importance, after all, and while some might consider the offer an insult there are others who suggest that without this offer it's just as likely the island will be offered to Greece. $FROMCOUNTRY$ could ensure it isn't... and we could use all the allies in the Congress we can get.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900645;The Bosnian Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900645;$COUNTRY$ has a reasonable issue to bring before the upcoming Congress: while it seems beyond question that the Bosnians will be given independence, we could make a case for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ stewardship over Bosnia at the Congress and it seems likely we would be heeded... though it would, without a doubt, upset the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC900715;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ delegates were sent to the recent Congress-- reasonable considering it was the fate of our country and the entire Balkans that was being decided, or so we thought.

Through him, we may conduct a new treaty that turns these rights into colonial concessions. Considering that the control of the local sultans over these areas is murky at best, and more than one has sometimes granted rights to the same areas, it truly seems as if we are obtaining clearance for the creation of a British North Borneo Company rather than wresting land from the natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
