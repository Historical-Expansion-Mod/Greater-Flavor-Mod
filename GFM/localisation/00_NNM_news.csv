EVTDESC37255_NEWS_LONG;Boulanger's refusal to lead the coup gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back. The Minister of the Interior decided to investigate the matter.

The Parliament stripped him of his immunity from prosecution, the French Senate condemned him for treason, sentencing him to deportation and confinement.
