EVTNAME99900;The Singapore Free Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99900;The Free Port of Singapore. Due to its strategic position in the Straits of Johore, Singapore grew to become one of the most important ports in the world. In 1834, the British government ended the East India Company's monopoly on the China trade, allowing other British companies to enter the market and leading to a surge in shipping, as a result Singapore became an important coaling station for steam shipping networks that were beginning to form in the 1840s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99901;Chinese Migration to Singapore;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99901;Poverty in China due to the Opium Wars sparked many Chinese to seek better lives in Singapore, "These Chinese coolies formed the early backbone of Singapore's labor force, engaged mainly in hard physical labor. Their cheap labor in Singapore's mines, ports, construction sites, plantations and jungles contributed greatly to the island's growth. The word “coolie” is believed to have come from the Hindi term kuli, which is also the name of a native tribe of Gujerat in western India. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99902;The Free Immigrants of Australia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99902;Between 1793 and 1850 nearly 200,000 free settlers and assisted immigrants chose to migrate to Australia to start a new life. The majority were English agricultural workers or domestic servants who outnumbered the Irish and Scottish migrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99906;On his return to Germany from his 1879–1882 Pacific expedition, Otto Finsch joined a small, informal group interested in German colonial expansion into the South Seas led by the banker, Adolph von Hansemann. Finsch encouraged them to pursue the founding of a colony on the north-east coast of New Guinea and the New Britain Archipelago even providing them with an estimate of the costs of such a venture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99907;The Don Pacifico Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99907;It is with much grief that I feel myself obliged to communicate to your Excellency a dreadful event which has happened to me, and as an English subject to beg your protection. Last Sunday, Easter-day, at about 12 o'clock, a crowd of people, presented themselves at the door of my house, which they very soon battered down. These brigands, in number about 300 or 400, entered my house, and began beating my wife and my innocent children. After having broken every article of furniture, they robbed me of every valuable in my possession..;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99908;Apparently, the former Portuguese Consul Don Pacifico was attacked by a mob in his home and in an act of pure arrogance, the British have demanded a compensation be paid to this man, of which the valuation of his losses are worth more than the Royal Place in Athens! Our pride dictates that we cannot give in to these absurd claims, but to not do so might incur the wrath of the mighty Royal Navy..;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99909;I have desired the Admiralty to instruct Sir William Parker to take Athens on his way back from the Dardanelles, and to support you in bringing at last to a satisfactory ending the settlement of our various claims upon the Greek Government. If however, the Greek Government does not strike, Parker must do so. In that case you should embark on board his fleet before he begins to take any hostile steps, in order that you and your mission may be secure against insult. He should, of course, begin by reprisals, that is, by taking possession of some Greek property, but the King would probably not much care for our taking hold of any merchant property, and the best thing, therefore, would be to seize hold of his little fleet, if that can be done handily. The next thing would be a blockade of any or all of his ports.... - Lord Palmerston, Foreign Secretary;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The French and the Prussians are calling for us to resist the British Blockade, but have not guaranteed any military support.

EVTNAME99930;Splendid Isolation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99930;It is the duty of the Government of this country, placed as it is with regard to geographical position, to keep itself upon terms of goodwill with all surrounding nations, but not to entangle itself with any single or monopolizing alliance with any one of them, above all to endeavor not to interfere needlessly and vexatiously with the internal affairs of any foreign country. - Lord Edward Stanley, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. \n\nThe policy of 'splendid isolation' was characterized by Britain's reluctance to enter into permanent European alliances or commitments with the other great powers. During the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99928;The Australian Gold Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT99904;Gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT99928;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99928;In the 1850s, the cities of each colony began a period of dramatic change. This transformation was due to an increased population, wealth from the gold rushes in New South Wales and Victoria and new ideas generated by a culturally diverse population. By the end of the decade, public structures and housing in Sydney and Melbourne had multiplied. Many elegant and ornate civic buildings with attractive tree-lined and paved streetscapes were built. \n\nBetween 1851 and 1854, the population of Victoria grew from about 77,000 to more than 200,000. The estimated population of Australia in 1850 was approximately 400,000, but had increased to 1 million by 1860.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99932;The Treaty of Frankfurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99932;The Treaty of Frankfurt was signed in Frankfurt on $YEAR$, at the end of the Franco-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ War.

EVTNAME99934;The Death of Queen Victoria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99934;The day was one of glorious sunshine. . . \n\n Queen Victoria, whose 63-year reign , was the longest in British history, came to an end at her estate, Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight on $MONTH$, $YEAR$. Victoria was eighty-one years old and had served as Britain's Queen for almost sixty-four years.

EVTNAME99903;The California Gold Rush;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99903;The California Gold Rush began on $YEAR$, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The first to hear confirmed information of the gold rush were the people in Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), and Latin America, and they were the first to start flocking to the state in late $YEAR$. \n\n All in all, the news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. Of the 300,000, approximately half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99913;The largest gold rush ever to take place on North American soil has all but come to an end. Where gold was once found in abundance by panning creaks and rich veins sparkled at the stroke of a pickaxe, even traces are hard to come by now. An estimated 370 metric tons of gold have been extracted, exhausting the deposits. Of the miners, about half made a modest profit, taking all expenses into account. Some particularly lucky miners and merchants became very rich, especially those selling prospecting supplies. However, many late arrivals to California arrived when the gold was already running short and walked away with empty hands. Many boom towns whose economy was purely based on gold mining, especially those built in inhospitable and infertile areas of the Sierra Nevada, have become so-called ghost towns after being abandoned by their residents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99935;The Lone Star State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99935;In $YEAR$, Congress narrowly passed a bill that authorized the U.S. to annex the Republic of Texas if it so voted. The legislation set the date for annexation for the end of of the same year. A majority of voters in Texas approved a proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and the slave trade. This constitution was later accepted by the U.S. Congress, making Texas a state on the same day annexation took effect, therefore bypassing a territorial phase \n\n The Mexican government had long warned that annexation would mean war with the U.S. When Texas joined the U.S., the Mexican government broke diplomatic relations with the United States. The U.S. now assumed the claims of Texas when it claimed all land north of the Rio Grande. In $YEAR$ President James K. Polk sent General Zachary Taylor to Texas, soon 3,500 Americans were on the Nueces River, prepared to defend Texas from a Mexican invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99936;Chinese Migration to Singapore;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99936;In the mid-to-late 19th century, the Chinese Qing Empire weakened substantially and became increasingly unable to support the Lanfang Republic as its vassal state. Thus, Lanfang Republic's vigorous development suffered from the eventual expansion of the Dutch. The Republic's citizenry waged a tenacious resistance, but ultimately failed due to poor weaponry. Many of Lanfang's citizens and their descendants made their way to Sumatra or Singapore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99937;Georges Boulanger;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99937;Georges Ernest Jean-Marie Boulanger, nicknamed General Revanche, was a French officer who was noted for his bravery and leadership during the Franco-Prussian War and was among the leaders of the Third Republic who crushed the short-lived Paris Commune. \n\n With backing from his direct superior, Henri d'Orleans, duc d'Aumale (incidentally, one of the sons of former king Louis-Philippe), Boulanger was made a brigadier-general and in $YEAR$ was appointed  director of infantry at the war office. His base of support and popularity comes from the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, however he was initially seen as a Republican. He is noted for an aggressive form of nationalism, known as Revanchism, which opposes The German Empire and calls for the defeat of the Franco-Prussian War to be avenged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99938;After Georges Boulanger was was recalled from the command of the army in North Africa, he returned to Paris, and began to take part in politics under the aegis of Georges Clemenceau and the Radicals. \n\n In $YEAR$, when Charles de Freycinet was brought into power, Clemenceau used his influence to secure Boulanger's appointment as War Minister. Clemenceau assumed Boulanger was a republican, because he was known not to attend Mass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99939;The Schnaebele Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99939;In $YEAR$, the French Havas news agency published a dispatch to the effect that Guillaume Schnaebele, a mid-level and obscure French police inspector, had been arrested by two agents of the German secret police on the Franco-German frontier near Pagny-sur-Moselle, as he was travelling for a meeting with the German police inspector there, at the latter's request. A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, under the circumstances Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n\n The reason given for the arrest was that in a previous inquiry, evidence had been produced that Schnaebele was involved in transmitting information as to German fortresses, furnished by Alsatians in the pay of the French Government, in other words, the Germans believe Schnaebelé to be a spy. \n\n What should the response of the French Government be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99940;In $YEAR$, the French Havas news agency published a dispatch to the effect that Guillaume Schnaebele, a mid-level and obscure French police inspector, had been arrested by two agents of the German secret police on the Franco-German frontier near Pagny-sur-Moselle, as he was on his way to Ars-sur-Moselle for a meeting with the German police inspector there, at the latter's request. A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, the French claim Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n\n It is suspected by German officials that Schnaebelé had been spying on German border fortresses for the French Government, however the circumstances behind his arrest may put us in a negative light despite of the proofs of guilt. \n\n What should our response to the French be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99941;The Schnaebele Affair - Schnaebele is released!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99941;Within a week of his arrest, Schnaebelé was released by order of the German Emperor William I. Although the German Government considered, in view of the proofs of guilt, the arrest to be fully justified, it was deemed expedient to release Schnaebelé on the ground that business meetings between frontier officials "must always be regarded as protected by a mutually-assured safe conduct." \n\n Although many in France believe Bismarck backed down because he was afraid of Boulanger, the French Army is no better of than it was during the Franco-Prussian War. \n\n There is now question on what to do with Boulanger, with many within the government to have him sacked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99942;Daniel Wilson, son-in-law of the sitting President Jules Grevy, has been caught selling Legion d'honneur medals for his own personal gain public outcry for his arrest and for Jules Grevy to resign. \n\n During this period, General Boulanger was in Switzerland, where he met with Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II, technically a Bonapartist, who offered his full support to the cause. The Bonapartists had attached themselves to the general, and even the Comte de Paris encouraged his followers to support him. Once seen as a republican, Boulanger shows his true colors in the camp of the conservative monarchists. In $MONTH$, $YEAR$ Boulanger was expelled from the army and the day after, Daniel Wilson had his imprisonment repealed. It seemed to the French people that honorable generals were punished while corrupt politicians were spared, further increasing Boulanger's popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99943;Boulanger Wins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99943;In the elections of $YEAR$, Boulanger ran as a deputy for Paris, and, after an intense campaign, took the seat with 244,000 votes against the 160,000 of his main adversary. A coup d'état seems probable and desirable among his supporters. How should the next few days proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99944;Had Boulanger immediately placed himself at the head of a revolt he might have effected the coup which many of his partisans had worked for, and might even have governed France, but the opportunity passed with his procrastination on $MONTH$. According to Lady Randolph Churchill "all his thoughts were centered in and controlled by her who was the mainspring of his life. After the plebiscite...he rushed off to Madame Bonnemain's house and could not be found". \n\n Boulanger decided that it would be better to contest the general election and take power legally. This gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back, and activities of secret societies were soon forbidden and banned.\n\nShortly afterward the government issued a warrant for Boulanger's arrest for conspiracy and treasonable activity. To the astonishment of his supporters, he fled Paris before it could be executed, going first to Brussels and then to London.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Nian fortified their captured cities and used them as bases to launch cavalry attacks against Qing troops in the countryside, prompting local towns to fortify themselves against Nian raiding parties. \n\nIn $MONTH$, $YEAR$, the Qing government sent the Mongol General Senggelinqin, who had recently crushed a large Taiping army, to defeat the Nian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Secondly, several coastal cities of China are still under our influence and control, and under the past treaties with the Qing, these ports have to remain open to foreign trade. \n\nNow the question is which course should we take - Extending our influence to the breakaway Chinese states, Seizing the coastal ports open to foreign trade, or make peace with the new Chinese Kingdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cherif Boubaghla has launched another revolt against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, launching an attack against a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army detachment near Gohhni.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME988888;The Liberals demand a Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC988888;Since the death of king Fernando VII in 1833, his wife Maria Cristina has been the regent of Spain for her daughter Isabella. In 1834, the Estatuto Real was issued by Maria Cristina. This was not a constitution but permitted greater freedom than the previous absolutist rule of Fernando VII. News has broken that liberal members of the army have captured Maria Cristina and demanded a return to the 1812 constitution. Should we agree to ensure her safety?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
988888OP1;The liberals shall not succeed, the Estatuto Real of 1834 will continue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
988888OP2;A new moderate constitution will be created ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
988888OP3;The liberals will get their demands. The 1812 constitution will return once more;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37706;Pablo Picasso has abandoned the conventional ideas of painting and begun using a far more conceptual style, influenced by sculpture and African art.One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he spends the most of his life in France. He inspires and develops a wide variety of different styles, among others, he is renowned for co-founding of the Cubist movement. Born with remarkable talent, Picasso painted realistically through his childhood and adolescence, to advance to more abstract and experimental forms later in his life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME530005;The Great Seattle Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC530005;The port city of Seattle has been engulfed in flames. The flood-battered shore flats of Elliot Bay prompted many residents of the boom town to build their homes atop wooden stilts and pipes, with more recent arrivals resorting to shoddy shacks along the notorious Skid Row. An accident at a carpentry shop lit the tinderbox of a town, but miraculously without loss of life. Local business interests, seeking to redevelop the town to avoid future disasters of this magnitude, have asked us to invest in a project to raise the street level, burying the ruins of flood and flame in the basements of new construction. This would be a costly development, but would breath fresh life into the notoriously derelict city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA530005;Raise the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME441256;A City's Name;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC441256;Various competing names have been proposed for the city residing on the shores of the Puget Sound. The most prevalent of these are "Alki" after a common motto in the Chinook jargon, "Dewamps" from the local Indian tribe, and "Seattle" from the name of a local tribal chieftain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA441256;It shall be named Seattle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB441256;Dewamps it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC441256;Alki is a fine name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC42342;A long time has passed since the civil war. There are festivals in the streets, in which the union flag and people is hoisted and our national anthem is sung with pride. People around the country, born after the times of strife, have become true patriots. All identity associated with the old states of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama has been lost. There's no doubt about it: The future of the union is now guaranteed to be preserved forever, Bolívar's legacy will live on.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48742;With the proclamation of independence of a new Republic in defiance of the Union, our national integrity is under threat. It seems that we have returned to the days of the civil war. Swift action must be taken if we are to restore the Union!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9899812;After our defeat in the Austro-Prussian war, we were forced to give up most of our land in Germany. A question now faces us Prussians: Should we still support the idea of uniting with all the other German states now dominated by the rule of the Habsburgs, or should we give up on Germany and go on a separate path as the Kingdom of Prussia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9899813;The Prussians have declared their desire to exit the German Confederation and continue as a fully independent state. It's very clear they do not wish to be included in united German state under our rule. Leaving them as an independent state that is separate from the Confederation would mean giving up on many Germans living in western and eastern Prussia. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9899814;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has denied us our exit from the German Confederation. They claim we are Germans and they won't rest until all of the German people are united under one country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
