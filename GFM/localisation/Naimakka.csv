EVTNAME48190001;The Carlist Sublevation of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190001;\n\nThe recent turmoil with Spain's empire has seen an increase in support for Carlism. A series of small uprisings have sprung up around the country starting in Badalona, where a group of armed Carlists initiated a shootout with police outside the civil guard barracks. Other than the shootout in Badalona, a couple of other towns have also seen some smaller insurrections consisting of roughly 30 people each. The revolts have been entirely unsuccessful, and peace is settling again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
