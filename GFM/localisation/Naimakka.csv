EVTNAME48190001;The Carlist Sublevation of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190001;\n\nThe recent turmoil with Spain's empire has seen an increase in support for Carlism. A series of small uprisings have sprung up around the country starting in Badalona, where a group of armed Carlists initiated a shootout with police outside the civil guard barracks. Other than the shootout in Badalona, a couple of other towns have also seen some smaller insurrections consisting of roughly 30 people each. The revolts have been entirely unsuccessful, and peace is settling again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME48190002;The Great Natchez Tornado;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190002;\n\nA massive tornado formed some twenty miles southwest of the city of Natchez and then followed the Mississippi River north, stripping both sides of the coast. The storm later struck at Natchez' river port, Natchez Landing, destroying the vast majority of the boats that were docked there and drowning their crews and passengers. The tornado destroyed almost all of Natchez Landing before moving towards Natchez proper, ruining many buildings in the central and northern parts of the city. On top of the destruction in Natchez, the damages also stretched into the town of Vidalia on the opposite side of the river. More than 300 people died and the property damage caused will take considerable time and resources to repair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME48190003;The $YEAR$ Rhodes Blood Libel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190003;\n\nOn the 18th of February a Greek Rhodian Woman reported to the authorities that her son had gone missing after taking a walk the day before. The Governor of the island ordered a search but after multiple days nothing had been found. Rumours quickly spread amongst the Greek Christian population that the boy had been murdered by jews for ritualistic purposes. Local authorities, pressed by the christians investigated the Jewish quarter, to again find nothing. Multiple days later a woman claimed the she had witnessed the boy being taken to the city of Rhodes by four jews, one of which she named as Eliakim Stamboli. The man was promptly arrested, interrogated and had his feet whipped five times hundred times. He was further interrogated in the presence of many dignitaries such as the greek archbishop and several European consuls. Stamboli confessed to the ritual murder under torture thereby opening the door for local authorities to carry out further arrests. On the advice of the Greek bishops and European Consuls, the governor of the island blockaded the jewish quarter for twelve months blocking the supply of fresh food and water. However, word managed to slip out of the blockaded jewish quarters and reach other parts of Europe, particularly the head of the Rothschild family bank in Vienna who quickly used his influence and close personal relationship with von Metternich to get Austria involved. In the United Kingdom, the Board of Deputies of the British Jews, after som deliberation, also got involved and met with Lord Palmerston to ensure British intervention. After a while a consensus formed with the European diplomats in Constantinople that the persecution must be stopped. On the 21st of May the remaining jewish men were freed from custody and two months later a court had them acquitted. Lord Ponsoby has suggested that we issue a firman formally denouncing the blood libel accusations, doing so would ease relations with the European powers and our jewish communities but would certainly anger the greek population on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
