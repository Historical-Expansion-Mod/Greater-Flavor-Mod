EVTNAME48190001;The Carlist Sublevation of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190001;\n\nThe recent turmoil with Spain's empire has seen an increase in support for Carlism. A series of small uprisings have sprung up around the country starting in Badalona, where a group of armed Carlists initiated a shootout with police outside the civil guard barracks. Other than the shootout in Badalona, a couple of other towns have also seen some smaller insurrections consisting of roughly 30 people each. The revolts have been entirely unsuccessful, and peace is settling again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME48190002;The Great Natchez Tornado;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190002;\n\nA massive tornado formed some twenty miles southwest of the city of Natchez and then followed the Mississippi River north, stripping both sides of the coast. The storm later struck at Natchez' river port, Natchez Landing, destroying the vast majority of the boats that were docked there and drowning their crews and passengers. The tornado destroyed almost all of Natchez Landing before moving towards Natchez proper, ruining many buildings in the central and northern parts of the city. On top of the destruction in Natchez, the damages also stretched into the town of Vidalia on the opposite side of the river. More than 300 people died and the property damage caused will take considerable time and resources to repair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME48190003;The Bayless Dam Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190003;\n\nAfter a week of heavy rainfall, the Bayless Dam collapsed and flooded the town of Austin, Pennsylvania. The dam, which was originally constructed to supply power for a paper mill run by Bayless Paper, had cut significant corners in its construction in order to save costs, missing out on vital safety features. The flood caused by the failure of the dam killed 78 people and caused significant damage to much of Austin- in some places the water was so high only the tops of churches could be seen. The failure of the dam has brought into question the lax local regulations surrounding these constructions, however Bayless Paper seems adamant on rebuilding their lost assets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME48190004;The $YEAR$ Rhodes Blood Libel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC48190004;\n\nIn February, a Greek Rhodian boy went missing prompting a search of the island, which failed to turn up any results. Rumors spread amongst the Greek Christian population that the boy had been murdered by Jews for ritualistic purposes. Local authorities investigated the Jewish quarter to again find nothing. Days later, a woman claimed she had seen the boy being taken to the city by four Jews. One of the men she named was promptly arrested, interrogated and whipped five hundred times. The authorities also arrested several other Jewish men after the man confessed to the ritual murder under torture. The governor blockaded the Jewish quarter after the arrests but nevertheless word still managed to slip out and reach Jewish communities around Europe. Thanks to pressure by European diplomats, the Jewish men were freed in May and acquitted in July. A British diplomat has suggested that we issue a decree formally denouncing the blood libel accusations- doing so will ease relations with the European powers and our Jewish communities at the risk of angering the island's Greek population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
