EVTNAME190441;Grave Circle A, Mycenae;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190441;Grave Circle A is a 16th-century BC royal cemetery situated to the south of the Lion Gate, the main entrance of the Bronze Age citadel of Mycenae in southern Greece. This burial complex was initially constructed outside the fortification walls of Mycenae, but was ultimately enclosed in the acropolis when the fortifications were extended during the 13th century BC. The grave site represents one of the major characteristics of the early phase of the Mycenaean civilization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME190442;The Palace of Knossos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190442;Settled as early as the Neolithic period, the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete. The palace of Knossos eventually became the ceremonial and political center of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age, c. 1380–1100 BC. The reason why is unknown, but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward.\n\nThe site of Knossos has had a very long history of human habitation, beginning with the founding of the first Neolithic settlement c. 7000 BC. Neolithic remains are prolific in Crete. They are found in caves, rock shelters, houses and settlements. Knossos has a thick Neolithic layer indicating the site was a sequence of settlements before the Palace Period. The earliest was placed on bedrock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME200006;The first 'Beethovenfest';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200006;In 1845, the greatest living musicians of Germany fulfilled their project to erect a monument in memory of Ludwig van Beethoven, born in the city of Bonn in 1770. Beethoven is viewed by many as the most influential composer of the 19th century. The inauguration of the monument was celebrated with a great music feast, in which Franz Liszt took part. High ranking monarchs of the German states and the whole of Europe joined the festivities, which was marked by unbelievable musical mastership, scandals and diplomatic issues between the great powers. Anyway, Beethoven was a symbol of the unresting German nation spirit, and the values of liberty and democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME200007;The Constitution of Hanover;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200007;When King William died, Princess Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. Ernest Augustus became the King of Hanover. Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective, and would have preferred the popular viceroy, the Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but both of Ernest's younger brothers refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. \n\nHanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in 1819. This did little more than denote Hanover's change from an electorate to a kingdom, granted by the Congress of Vienna. The Duke of Cambridge, as King William's viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganization of the Hanoverian government. William IV had given his consent to a new constitution in 1833. The Duke of Cumberland's consent was neither asked nor received, and he had formally protested against the constitution's adoption without his consent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA200007;Suspend the constitution, it does not meet the Kingdom's needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB200007;The Monarch is above the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB200008;They are right. We should strive for a more liberal society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200009;The Göttinger Seven;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200009;Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the new King Ernest August dissolved the parliament which had been convened under the disputed constitution. He proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the ground that his consent had not been asked, and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs. The King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored. In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at Göttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths, and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions, and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover. However, he was widely criticized in other parts of Germany and Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA200009;Even if liberalism is a thread, the king has gone too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Beethoven monument turned its back on the most important guests, King Frederick William IV of Prussia and the British Queen Victoria, who had taken their places on the balcony of the Fürstenberg Palace. Alexander von Humboldt saved the day by remarking that Beethoven had always been a rude fellow. Even more embarrassed was the fact that, during the toasts at the festival banquet in the 'Goldene Stern', Liszt snubbed the French contingent led by Berlioz and nearly caused a riot. Also, the Spanish dancer, Lola Montez, the famous mistress of the popular tragic-romantic King Ludwig I of Bavaria, made a scandalous guest appearance by dancing wildly on the tables. The king was later forced to end his affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

His works include four novels, epic and lyric poetry, prose and verse dramas, memoirs, an autobiography, literary and aesthetic criticism, and treatises on botany, anatomy, and color. In addition, there are numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him extant. \n\nGoethe is the greatest son of Frankfurt.

Brentano, whose early writings were published under the pseudonym Maria, belonged to the Heidelberg group of German romantic writers, and his works are marked by excess of fantastic imagery and by abrupt, bizarre modes of expression. On the whole his finest work is the collection of Romanzen vom Rosenkranz (published posthumously in 1852). His short stories were very popular. The latter part of his life he spent in Regensburg, Frankfurt and Munich, actively engaged in promoting the Catholic faith. Against his will, his works were often seen as devotional literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With this project, the king also aimed to 'invent' a new architectural style which would combine the best features of historical models combined with then modern building technology. The avenue is framed by mostly neo-Gothic buildings influenced by the English Perpendicular style.

EVTDESC202045;The Mole Antonelliana is a major landmark building in Turin. Named after the architect who built it, Alessandro Antonelli, the building was conceived and constructed as a synagogue. The Jewish community of Turin - with a budget of 250,000 lire and the intention of having a building worthy of a capital city - hired Antonio Antonelli. Antonelli promised  to build a synagogue for 280,000 lire. The relationship between Antonelli and the Jewish community was not happy. He proposed a series of modifications which raised the height to 167 meters, over 46 meters higher than the dome in the original design. Such changes, in addition to greater costs and construction time than were originally anticipated, did not please the Jewish community and construction was halted in 1869, with a provisional roof. The people of Turin, who had watched the synagogue rise skyward, demanded that the city take over the project.

EVTDESC202051;Giovanni Pascoli was an Italian poet and classical scholar. He studied at the University of Bologna, where his teacher and mentor was Giosuè Carducci. Pascoli, even in a period of Positivism and scientism, believed that life is a mystery. Only symbolic associations discovered in the humble things of nature can lead man to catch a glimpse of the truth behind mere appearances. His later poems share similar themes but are more experimental, and reflect his knowledge of classical antiquity. They were a great influence on later Italian poets, who incorporated his melancholy themes into their own works. He wrote in both Italian and Latin, he also translated English poetry. Pascoli was also a political activist, sympathizing with Socialism. In $YEAR$, when the War of Libia broke out, he assumed a prominent role in the public debate. Pascoli's interventionist politicis were not unique in Italian intellectual circles: his rhetoric helped to shape the public mind and to create feelings of patriotism, of fraternal pride and of a shared destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
