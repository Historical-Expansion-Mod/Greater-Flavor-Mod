EVTNAME37299;The Colony of Libreville;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37299;Ever since the abolishment of slavery the African population of our country would flock back to the African continent is search of better life and/or freedom. One of the examples of this process is the free colony of Libreville set on the shores of Africa. We might want to take advantage of this and establish a colonial rule there as a long-term investment, or leave the people to their deserved freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1000200;The New Protector of Eastern Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1000200;Now that we are powerful enough to hold our own, an important matter rose up regarding our role in the Eastern Christendom. It is a well known fact that the Byzantine Empire for a long time was the center of the Orthodox Church and the Eastern Christendom as a whole. Sadly, we've lost our authority and power due to numerous wars and raids and our title as the protector was taken by an another powerful Orthodox nation known as the Russian Empire. We are glad that they've been doing our work for centuries now, but it's time that we take this title back since it's supposed to be us that should protect the Eastern Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1000201;The Orthodox Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1000201;We've been notified that the newly restored Byzantine Empire seeks to recaim its title as the Orthodox Protector. We've taken their duty to continue protecting the Eastern Christendom as a powerful nation within it. Should we stand down and give the title back to its original owner, or should we hold onto it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1000202;The Russian Empire refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1000202;The fools of The Russian Empire refuted our rightfull claim on the title of the Orthodox Protector. The title is ours by definition and they will pay for denying us our claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1000203;The Russian Empire accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1000203;As we expected, the Russians complied and offered back the title of Eastern Protectors. This is a joyous day for the mighty Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1000204;The War is Won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1000204;We have proven in battle that we are truly worth the title we were fighting for. The Russian Empire will have to agree to our demands and our position in the Eastern Christendom will be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1000205;The War is Lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1000205;We have lost the war and forever lost the right to call ourselves the Protectors of Eastern Christendom. The new title owners have proven themselves to be more suitable for this role and we'll have to set our sights elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there exists the concern they may conspire behind our backs with the local Tejanos to help Mexico place us under their control again. In addition, they occupy land which we could use to invite more settlers from the United States. They've already dealt with their own native populations by confining them in reservations, which happened to be across our northern border. We should do the same with our own, and send them there as well. They will oppose this, naturally, and even fight us. However, we are confident we will have no problem forcing them to move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
