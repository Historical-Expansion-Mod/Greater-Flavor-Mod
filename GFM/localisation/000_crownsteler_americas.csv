enact_the_homestead_act_desc;In the West lies the vast and vacant land of the Great Plains. It is an harsh an unproductive land, home to nothing but bands of roaming savages and bison. We can offer these lands -Federal lands- free to any man who wants to put a plow into the unbroken sod. Offering the golden opportunity of freedom and self-sufficiency to all who conquer this tough sod with hard work, and providing productive land to our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_the_plantation_and_ranching_act_title;The Plantation & Ranching Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_the_plantation_and_ranching_act_desc; The Great Plains are a harsh place with tough sod and little rainfall, not easily conquered or cultivated. Turning it into productive land benefiting the nation would require major investment, far beyond the means of small scale farmers. The Federal lands of the West ought to be granted to those of means, for the establishment of plantations and ranches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
first_treaty_of_fort_laramie_title;The Treaty of Fort Laramie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
first_treaty_of_fort_laramie_desc;Tens of thousands travel West on the Oregon and Santa Fe Trails each year, searching for fresh lands, opportunity, gold, or just running away from something. A long and arduous journey not made any easier by hostile Indian nations, who -even when not explicitly targeting the wagon trains- make -with their incessant warfare- the journey a particularly risky endeavor. We can call a great conference of the plains Indians to force an end to their warfare, guarantee the right of free passage of our wagon trains, as well as secure lands west of the Mississippi for settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indian_removal_act_title;The Indian Removal Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indian_removal_act_desc;§RGain 4 infamy§! While in the North the Indians have long since disappeared, in the South the Five Civilized Tribes -the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole- are still firmly established. It would be hard to argue that they are prospering though: they are subject of continuous encroachment by settlers seeking new, fertile, lands to farm. In this march of progress, it is unlikely that their way of life -or indeed they themselves- will survive for long. It has been argued that the tribes should be evacuated West, across the Mississippi, where they can live and preserve their way of life under self-rule.\n\nEnacting the Indian Removal Act will allow us to start negotiating to this effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indian_cessations_title;The Indian Cessations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indian_cessations_desc;For years the hypocritical North has been lecturing us on the need to respect the Indians living on our lands, to protect them and to not settle their territories. Yet they do so from the comfort of having their own lands cleared of Indians and opened for settlement by generations past. Now free from their domination, we can finally open the Indian lands to settlement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cramped walls, littered with chains and ropes, tell tales of the trade that goes on in this auction house. One by one, blacks are shoved unto a small stage to stand, their hands tied, while the auctioneer calls out the bids.

EVTNAME16121;Abolitionist Pamphlets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16121;An extensive tract, describing the purported unconstitutionality of slavery, is being widely disseminated in $PROVINCENAME$. Allowing its continued circulation might upset the lower classes -- where it has seen its widest circulation -- but attempting to curtail distribution will definitely be regarded as an attack on freedom of speech, which will anger the districts big-wigs.

EVTDESC16131;'Where am I!?', he wakes up screaming. Upon being told that he was found collapsed just a few yards north across from the $STATENAME$ border, he starts laughing. It's a calm laugh, interrupted only by the occasional cough. - '$STATENAME$. I'm in $STATENAME$. Oh merciful Lord, I'm in $STATENAME$!' The man is a slave, escaped from some or other plantation down South of Mason-Dixon. He's wounded, but still alive. What perils he has suffered on his way to $PROVINCENAME$, only the good Lord knows.

EVTNAME16141;Underground Railroad;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16141;The Underground Railroad was an informal network, run by abolitionists of varying creeds and colors, dedicated to helping slaves escape from the southern slave-states to freedom in the North. We have every reason to believe that $PROVINCENAME$ has recently developed into a hotbed of Railroad activity. We could put pressure on local politicians to combat their activities, but only at the risk of stirring up abolitionist sentiments in the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16151;Copperheads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16151;The 'Copperheads' were a group of Democrats in the Northern United States who, during the Civil War, opposed the war, and favored a peace settlement with the South. The moniker came originally from Unionists likening them to poisonous snakes, but it soon struck home with the Copperheads themselves. While there is no war yet, there is staunch resistance to abolitionism within some democratic circles in $PROVINCENAME$. Stepping up the local political campaigning could probably neutralize them, but only at the cost of offending Southern sentiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16311;The Amistad;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16311;The Supreme Court is about to hear a contentious case involving the Spanish schooner 'La Amistad', which had been brought to one of our ports after suffering a slave rebellion.\nThe British have taken a keen interest in the case: arguing that the slaves had originated in Africa and were transported -in violation of treaties signed by both Spain and the U.S.- across the Atlantic: They should therefore be released. A position much lauded and supported by domestic abolitionists, who have formed committees to support the Amistad slaves. The Spanish, however, counter that the Amistad was carrying domestic slaves, born before 1820, for -legal- internal trade and, as the crime occurred on a Spanish ship, to Spanish nationals, in Spanish waters, only they have jurisdiction on the matter, in accordance with treaties signed between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16313;In a ruling delivered today, the Supreme Court has decided that the slaves involved in the violent rebellion aboard the Spanish schooner 'Amistad' of 1839, later apprehended near Long Island, New York, are legal property of their Spanish owners and should be returned to their possession as soon as possible in accordance with the Pinckney's Treaty. The court has no standing to question the legality of their status of slaves under Spanish law, and would be a mute point, as the slaves would -under U.S. law- have to be returned to Spain to stand trial for their involvement in the mutiny and death of the crew. This ruling is viewed as a landmark victory for property rights, and by extension slave power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16314;In a ruling delivered today, the Supreme Court has decided that the slaves involved in the violent rebellion aboard the Spanish schooner 'Amistad' of 1839, later apprehended near Long Island, New York, are, in light of the outlawing of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, slaves nor property, but, as the mutiny occurred on a Spanish ships in Spanish waters resulting in the death of Spanish nationals, the Court has no standing to judge this matter and they have to be returned to Spain to stand trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16320;Civil Discourse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16320;'Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine.'-Representative Preston Brooks\n\nA brutal onslaught took place on the House floor today, as Southern representative Brooks pulled out his cane and proceeded to beat abolitionist Sumner senseless over an inflammatory and offensive speech made earlier. Caught by surprise, Sumner had no defense and no help, as any intercession was blocked by Brook's associates. Not even the breaking of the cane or Sumner's collapse to the ground halted the assault, only the arrival of the Sergeant at Arms did. Sumner lives, but is expected to suffer lasting damage from his ordeal.\nAnd yet, while this may be the most prominent example to date, this is not an isolated incident, as the battle lines over the issue of slavery are increasingly clear in our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16326;Prigg v. Pennsylvania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16326;A man by the name of Edward Prigg was convicted some time ago under Pennsylvania law on grounds of abduction and assault for trying to return a -virtually free, but never legally emancipated- slave to her legal owners. As such action is legal under the Constitution and federal law, Prigg has brought suit against the state of Pennsylvania on the grounds that Pennsylvania law violates the Constitution and federal law.\n\nThe Supreme Court, having heard the arguments, has ruled that the Pennsylvania law is unconstitutional as a denial of slaveholder right's to recover their property under the Constitution and federal law. However, the ruling included the caveat that, if state law so prohibits, state officials cannot be compelled to enforce these rights. In effect, this ruling relieves state officials from their duty to enforce the return of fugitive slaves and makes it a fully federal matter, only enforceable by federal officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC650025;'The relationship between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations. ... The Federal Government inherited the sole right to deal with the Indian Nations from Great Britain.'\n\nThe Supreme Court has issued a ruling today, vacating the conviction of Samuel Worcester who was caught on Indian lands without a license. A requirement under Georgian state law, the Supreme Court ruled that the Indian Tribes are sovereign nations and state law is not applicable on their lands.\n\nA major setback for Georgia, which had been pursuing Indian removal in its own right, as well as advocates of states rights, as it reinforces federal supremacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
