no_schools_desc;There's no organized school system or budget for education. The scarce literacy gain that is achieved comes from religious schools or it is based on informal community teaching, though these places get some funding, indirectly, from the government. Higher education institutions are either non existent or completely religious and medieval.\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%. If it is 50%, funding needs to be at least 20%. If it is 75%, funding needs to be at least 30%. Otherwise literacy will start to fall.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_schools_desc;A rudimentary school system exists in the capital and a few important cities but enrollment is completely optional. Schools limits themselves to teaching pupils how to read and write. There's no government agency to inspect schools and they have no common standards for teaching, with the few courses that exist being overcrowded. Private schools are commonly in the same conditions. Teachers don't have professional formation and are often just literate men, while pupils often leave school without being properly schooled.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 30%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%. If it is 50%, funding needs to be at least 20%. If it is 75%, funding needs to be at least 30%. Otherwise literacy will start to fall.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
acceptable_schools_desc;Schools can be found in every major and most of the medium cities. A government agency exists to ensure quality standards in education and to inspect that proper facilities are used for it. Enrollment is encouraged and sometimes it's outright mandatory, but it's not properly enforced and pupils often don't go to school for a variety of reasons. Children are also taught math and a few other subjects. Education institutions for teenagers are starting to appear, and secular, higher education institutions for adults are common. Teachers are formally trained, but oftentimes poorly.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 40%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%. If it is 50%, funding needs to be at least 20%. If it is 75%, funding needs to be at least 30%. Otherwise literacy will start to fall.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
good_schools_desc;Schools can be found in almost every city. Government agencies take education with the utmost seriousness, and enrollment is mandatory and tightly controlled. Children and teenagers are taught a variety of subjects besides reading and writing and teachers are taught pedagogy during their formation. Literacy campaigns for adults and the elderly are a part of the government's effort to eradicate illiteracy. Higher education institutions are considered good, with opportunities for the poor classes to enroll.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 50%.\nA fully funded education provides a bonus to this reform.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

synthetic_sulphur_factory_desc;Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF's Oppau plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year. During World War I, the production of munitions required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large sodium nitrate deposits in Chile controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort. Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of nitric acid, a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liquor_distillery_desc;The continuous still allowed the alcohol industry to reach new levels of productivity. The still consists of a first column (called the analyzer) in a column still that has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. It behaves like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPEEDEXPLAINED;So, in case you've been having problems with game speed, this event is for you. You may have already seen the performance submod that decreases terrain texture resolution for that purpose. Another thing can be done to increase performance, however it is a bit more difficult. \n 1. Go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\GFM\settings.txt \n 2. Find "update_time = 1.00000" in the file \n 3. Change it to "update_time = 100.00000" \n The issue with this is that it undoes itself every time you restart the game, so you either need to do it every time you start, or you can set the file to read only, however this makes the game unstable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31716;The Construction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31716;Work on the foundations of the Eiffel Tower began. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block built of limestone each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. Each shoe was anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were complete by $YEAR$ and the erection of the ironwork began. For this part, we need to set a budget for the construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31717;The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from L'Independent and La Vanguardia completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large Catalan flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME9991011;The Leicester Balloon Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9991011;It occurred at a test flight of a new hydrogen balloon by aeronaut Henry Tracey Coxwell, for which 50,000 spectators attended. The crowd were enraged by rumours that the balloon was not the largest and newest of Coxwell's balloons. As tensions ran high, a woman was allegedly struck by a police officer trying to defend the balloon from the crowd, causing a riot. Coxwell's balloon was torn to shreds by the crowds, which caused the gas envelope to collapse as he fled, under attack from the crowd. The event set back scientific progress in the field of high-level flight and was of great expense to Coxwell who had to build a replacement balloon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

adopt_the_peseta_desc;The Peseta is the currency used mainly in Northern Spain, and is regulated by a Central Bank, which is under government control. The name of the currency comes from peceta, a Catalan diminutive form of the Catalan word peça (meaning piece), and it can be divided into 100 céntimos. If we nationalize and officialize the currency, commerce within our state and with the world would be more accessible and regulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPAFORCEDCONSTITUTION;The Spanish Constitution of 1845 would replace the Constitution of 1837, reverting many liberties granted for it. In May 1844 General Ramón María Narváez took over the government, the moderates were divided on the need to reform the 1837 Constitution then in force - even the most reactionary group led by the Marquis de Viluma advocated its repeal and the return to the charter granted by the Royal Statute of 1834-. Narváez finally leaned towards the option of the reform defended by the group led by Alejandro Mon and Pedro José Pidal against the group of moderate "puritans" who defended its maintenance because its approval had been the result of consensus between the two large liberal parties, moderate and progressive, which would allow them to alternate in government without having to change the Constitution every time the government is changed. Our Queen, even if you are 14 years old, we have to ask: do you accept the new constitution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31723;Today engagements in the town of Vicálvaro have started between rebel troops under General Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan and government troops. The rebels want to restore the 1837 Constitution, which promised electoral and individual rights, but was and continues being too liberal for our King. They are well armed, and fight with will and the hope that their unnecessary rights are returned to them. Do we avoid more bloodshed and restore the Constitution or fight for our control over Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31724;The rebels advanced into Madrid, while engagements in the town of Vicálvaro have ceased with a victory of the rebel troops under General Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan. The rebels are rising in other parts of Spain, and we are surrounded in Madrid. Do we continue fighting and hope for the best or cede?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31725;Today our troops in the defence of Madrid have been victorious, and revolts in other parts of Spain are being put down by our glorious troops, defending our prestigious monarchy. Our country is in ruins and our people is tired of war, but Espartero escaped encirclement, alone with his horse, and retired to the countryside, where we hope he will die and dissapear from history. After all this bloodshed, we could try to calm our population, but doing so would also anger the reactionaries, which would search for rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31726;After a bloody war against the Carlists, pacts with them have been conducted in Lécera to establish the conditions of treatment of prisoners of war and regularization of exchanges, similar to the Elliot Convention in 1835. The Carlists had moved their prisoners of war to Onda, where they are tortured and starved. If we reach an agreement, we could stop that madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31727;Today a revolt started in Barcelona against the government of Joaquín María López, who has breached the agreements with the Central Board for the overthrow of the government of Espartero, produced a few weeks earlier and in violation of various provisions in the 1837 constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31728;It has been leaked that our provisional government wants to be a monarchy again, and the federalists, most of them in the north of the country, especially in Catalonia, are preparing for a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31729;Today news has reached us that negotiations between the Federalists of Vasconia and Catalonia, on the topic of rebellion and civil war, have been finished. We can't let the federalists enter our precious lands and sweep any recourses left, killing our economy in the process, and letting them enter our prestigious capital for them to establish a corrupt democracy. We could spy them to prevent rebellion, but it's to late. Do we unarm them by force or let them be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31730;Today engagements around the country are starting, and our forces are preparing for an impending civil war. Our people will have to suffer over it, or do we let them live in peace, and have all those "liberties" they want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31731;Today eight to ten thousand men rose to Empordà, Catalonia with the federal flag, decisively promoted for the suspension of the constitutional guarantees and the disarmament of the popular militias of Tortosa, Barcelona, Tarragona and other places in the always rebellious Catalonia.

Do we give them orders to fire or to move to more possible to defense land, like the Serralada Transversal to the West, or the Monseny to the South?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31732;Today rebellions in Valencia have started for the federalist cause. The monarchist troops, at the command of Joan Prim i Prats, which has been Militar Governor of Barcelona during its final bombing in 1843, and Captain of Puerto Rico, have surrounded Valencia and threathen to bomb it and stop the insurrections there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31733;Our valentious armies have been defeated in Madrid, after a harsh civil war, and insurrections already have expanded to Málaga, finishing any controlled land in Spain. We have no hope left, let them establish their puny democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31741;Today, Barcelona-based Swiss industrialist Hans Gamper has founded what will end up being Futbol Club Barcelona, along with a handful of sports enthusiasts, mainly foreigners, who gathered at Gimnàs Solé after their integration into Català FC was rejected. . The founders included the club's first players: Walter Wild, Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Künzli, Otto Maier, Enrique Ducay, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31742;The lower house of the Spanish Parliament approved the creation of a Commonwealth today, but with limited powers compared to those originally envisioned for it by its promoters. On 18 December 1913 the king signed the law granting all Spanish provinces the right to group themselves into associations or commonwealths, Catalonia being the only commonwealth so planned. The first President of the Commonwealth of Catalonia will be, if done, Enric Prat de la Riba, of the Lliga Regionalista, who will led a programme to create an efficient infrastructure of roads and ports, hydraulic works, railways, telephones, charities and healthcare. The Commonwealth also wants to undertook initiatives to increase agricultural and forest yields, introducing technological improvements, the improvement of services and education, and promoting education in technologies necessary for Catalan industry. The last decision is for the Spanish Senate, which depends on us to finish their decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31743;"Spaniards: The enthusiastic welcome that the Liberal Army found in the villages, so heroically shown in Vicálvaro, the applause with which the news of our patriotic uprising has been received everywhere, they assure from now on the triumph of the freedom which we have sworn to defend. In a few days most of the provinces will have shaken the tyrants, the nation will enjoy the benefits of the representative regime. It is time, then, to say what we are determined to do in the matter of victory. We want the preservation of the throne, the rigorous practice of the fundamental laws, tax cuts, we want to uproot the peoples from that centralization, giving them the local independence necessary to preserve their culture, and as a guarantee of all this we want and raise, under solid foundations, the National Militia. These are our attempts, which we express frankly, without imposing them on the nation. We'll lay the definitive foundations of liberal regeneration to which we aspire. We have our swords consecrated to the national will, and we will not sheath them until it is fulfilled.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31744;After a patriotic federalist manifesto by Espartero, the people has rose up everyone against our corrupt government, and surrounded the King's Palace, making us firm an armistice and negotiate peace. As we're occupied and wihout forces and will left, the only thing we can do is give them what they want and stop this bloodshed that rained over our beautiful Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31745;3 days ago a draft constitution was presented to a progressive chamber, and it was approved by it. This constitution contained the most advanced approaches of the progressive liberal ideology, where the principle of national sovereignty was reaffirmed, although now in an absolute way, and all institutions, including the Crown, would find their foundation in the will of the Nation, it also widely recognized political rights and installed, for the first time in Spain, a regime of religious tolerance. Its articulation is broader and more complete than that contained in the Constitution of 1837 and the Constitution of 1845. It is a rigid constitution, as it establishes a rather tedious reform procedure, procedure which was partly followed by the rest of the constitutions which were subsequently enacted. Regardless, yesterday, General Leopoldo O'Donnell staged a counter-revolution, staging a coup that ended the progressive biennium of the reign of Elizabeth II of Spain and decreed the closure of the Constituent Assembly elected in 1854, and cancelled the Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
