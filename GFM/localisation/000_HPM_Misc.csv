no_schools_desc;There's no organized school system or budget for education. The scarce literacy gain that is achieved comes from religious schools or it is based on informal community teaching, though these places get some funding, indirectly, from the government. Higher education institutions are either non existent or completely religious and medieval.\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%. If it is 50%, funding needs to be at least 20%. If it is 75%, funding needs to be at least 30%. Otherwise literacy will start to fall.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_schools_desc;A rudimentary school system exists in the capital and a few important cities but enrollment is completely optional. Schools limits themselves to teaching pupils how to read and write. There's no government agency to inspect schools and they have no common standards for teaching, with the few courses that exist being overcrowded. Private schools are commonly in the same conditions. Teachers don't have professional formation and are often just literate men, while pupils often leave school without being properly schooled.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 30%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

acceptable_schools_desc;Schools can be found in every major and most of the medium cities. A government agency exists to ensure quality standards in education and to inspect that proper facilities are used for it. Enrollment is encouraged and sometimes it's outright mandatory, but it's not properly enforced and pupils often don't go to school for a variety of reasons. Children are also taught math and a few other subjects. Education institutions for teenagers are starting to appear, and secular, higher education institutions for adults are common. Teachers are formally trained, but oftentimes poorly.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 40%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

good_schools_desc;Schools can be found in almost every city. Government agencies take education with the utmost seriousness, and enrollment is mandatory and tightly controlled. Children and teenagers are taught a variety of subjects besides reading and writing and teachers are taught pedagogy during their formation. Literacy campaigns for adults and the elderly are a part of the government's effort to eradicate illiteracy. Higher education institutions are considered good, with opportunities for the poor classes to enroll.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 50%.\nA fully funded education provides a bonus to this reform.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

synthetic_sulphur_factory_desc;Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF's Oppau plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year. During World War I, the production of munitions required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large sodium nitrate deposits in Chile controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort. Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of nitric acid, a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liquor_distillery_desc;The continuous still allowed the alcohol industry to reach new levels of productivity. The still consists of a first column (called the analyzer) in a column still that has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. It behaves like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

APRILUPRISING;Chaos reigns in Bulgaria as villages explode into revolt left and right. The Bulgarians' 480-year slumber has ended, and their awakening has sent us into a waking nightmare. An open revolt has begun, planned out by the secret Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee. The uprising has been divided into 4 separate revolutionary districts with separate command structures. Expat brigades of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee have crossed the Romanian border to aid their compatriots. Suffice to say fighting through every mountain village will be a bloody and protracted conflict, sure to attract the eyes of the international community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOODYLETTER;Brothers! \nYesterday, Neceb Aga came from Plovdiv to our village and demanded imprisoning several people, including me. I called up some brave men and after getting armed, we headed towards the konak and attacked it, killing the governor and some policemen. Now, as I write this letter, the flag waves before the konak, rifles shoot and the church bells echo simultaneously with them and men are kissing one another on the streets. If you, brothers, happen to be true patriots and apostles of freedom, then do follow our example in Panagyurishte. Koprivshtitsa, 20th April 1876 T. Kableshkov \n\nThe so-called 'Bloody Letter' was written in the blood of a local governor murdered by Bulgarian revolutionary Todor Kableshkov in an uprising. It has kicked off unrest across Bulgaria. We can only hope it doesn't get out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATAKMASSACRE;Ahmet Aga, the Ottoman commander, had surrounded the village and said that he wanted all arms laid down. Trendafil, the rebel leader, went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him. I heard Ahmet Aga command for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. His words were "Shishak aor" which is Turkish for "to put on a skewer". They took all his money, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth, impaled him slowly on a stake and roasted him. I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women, surrounded by Bashi-Bazuk who forced us to watch what was happening. One of the children, Vladimir, still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her. Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, there in front of me. Trendafil's burnt bones stood there for a month before being buried. \n\nOttoman irregulars have massacred the inhabitants of the village of Batak, the last holdout of the Bulgarian rebels. They did so independently of high command, but the international community is in uproar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

build_the_eiffel_tower_barcelona_title;Build the Eiffel Tower in Barcelona;;;;;;;;;;;;;
build_the_eiffel_tower_barcelona_desc;Barcelona deserves a new wonder of architecture--a world marvel along the lines of Egypt's pyramids or Rome's Colliseum. More than that, the region of Catalonia deserves to boast a new grand cultural achievement in celebration of the upcoming World Fair, of which we have selected to become the host country. The architects Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nougier, under the tutelage of civil engineer Gustave Eiffel, have designed a huge iron lattice tower to be built within Barcelona, overlooking the city like a giant steeple. It will be the centerpiece of the World Fair and serve as a permanent structure to go along with other masterpieces of architecture in the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31716;The Construction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31716;Work on the foundation of the Eiffel Tower is complete. The construction of the legs facing the the south and east were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The other two, however, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated. Each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15m (49 ft) long and 6m (20 ft) in diameter, driven to a depth of 22m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs support a block built of limestone, each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. The shoes are anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. \n\nThe laying of the ironwork for the tower's body can now begin, though we must set an appropriate budget for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31717;The Eiffel Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31717;The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from L'Independent and La Vanguardia completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large Catalan flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC9991011;It occurred at a test flight of a new hydrogen balloon by aeronaut Henry Tracey Coxwell, for which 50,000 spectators attended. The crowd were enraged by rumors that the balloon was not the largest and newest of Coxwell's balloons. As tensions ran high, a woman was allegedly struck by a police officer trying to defend the balloon from the crowd, causing a riot. Coxwell's balloon was torn to shreds by the crowds, which caused the gas envelope to collapse as he fled, under attack from the crowd. The event set back scientific progress in the field of high-level flight and was of great expense to Coxwell who had to build a replacement balloon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC18481984;We agreed in the Treaty of 1843 to never take possession of any parts of the Hawaiian domain, but French colonists and merchants continue to clamor for annexing Hawaii into our empire. Added to our ordeal over this "Hawaiian Question" is the persecution of French Catholics, whom we ought to avenge. Gillaume Patrice Dillon, the current consul in Hawaii, despite having previously been given orders by us not to display any "pugnaciousness," agrees that a show of force is necessary against the Hawaiians. He writes that "it will prove sufficient to display a good French corvette for three days at Honolulu to force concessions from this devious and hypocritical Government." Admiral Louis Tromelin, who is currently anchored in Honolulu, has proposed sending a list of demands that would protect Catholics and increase our economic influence under the threat of invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHHAWDEMANDS;France has sent a frigate under Admiral Louis Tromelin to deliver us a list of demands: the reduction of import duties on French brandy, the immunity of Catholic missionaries to our laws, the use of French as the language of communication between France and Hawaii, and the punishing of schoolboys who misbehave in Catholic churches.

adopt_the_peseta_desc;The Peseta is the currency used mainly in Northern Spain, and is regulated by a Central Bank, which is under government control. The name of the currency comes from peceta, a Catalan diminutive form of the Catalan word peça (meaning piece), and it can be divided into 100 céntimos. If we nationalize and officialize the currency, commerce within our state and with the world would be more accessible and regulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPAFORCEDCONSTITUTION;The Spanish Constitution of 1845 would replace the Constitution of 1837, reverting many liberties granted for it. In May 1844 General Ramón María Narváez took over the government, the moderates were divided on the need to reform the 1837 Constitution then in force - even the most reactionary group led by the Marquis de Viluma advocated its repeal and the return to the charter granted by the Royal Statute of 1834. Narváez finally leaned towards the option of the reform defended by the group led by Alejandro Mon and Pedro José Pidal against the group of moderate "puritans" who defended its maintenance because its approval had been the result of consensus between the two large liberal parties, moderate and progressive, which would allow them to alternate in government without having to change the Constitution every time the government is changed. Our Queen, even if you are 14 years old, we have to ask: do you accept the new constitution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31723;News has reached us that engagements between rebel troops under General Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan and government troops have started in the town of Vicálvaro. The rebels demand the restoration of the 1837 Constitution which granted electoral and individual rights but was too liberal for our Queen, getting replaced in 1845 by a more conservative constitution. The rebels are well armed and fight with tenacity and hope, believing that they can overthrow the government and restore rights to the citizenry. Do we avoid more bloodshed and restore the constitution of 1837 or fight for our control over Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31724;The rebels under General Leopoldo O'Donnell have advanced into Madrid after defeating government forces in the town of Vicálvaro. Rebels are rising in other parts of Spain and are have gathered to surround Madrid. Do we continue fighting and hope for the best or give in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31725;Today our troops in the defense of Madrid have been victorious, and revolts in other parts of Spain are being put down by our glorious troops, defending our prestigious monarchy. Our country is in ruins and our people is tired of war, but Espartero escaped encirclement, alone with his horse, and retired to the countryside, where we hope he will die and disappear from history. After all this bloodshed, we could try to calm our population, but doing so would also anger the reactionaries, which would search for rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31726;After a bloody war against the Carlists, pacts with them have been conducted in Lécera to establish the conditions of treatment of prisoners of war and regularization of exchanges, similar to the Elliot Convention in 1835.

EVTDESC31727;Today a revolt started in Barcelona against the government of Joaquín María López, who has breached the agreements with the Central Board for the overthrow of the government of Espartero, produced a few weeks earlier and in violation of various provisions in the 1837 constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31728;We have been told by informants that the federalist movement, concentrated largely in the North of the country, is preparing for a revolt. The situation seems dire, especially in Catalonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31729;News has reached us that negotiations between the federalists of Vasconia and Catalonia concerning the prospect of rebellion have been finished. We can't let the federalists seize our precious lands, sweep away our traditions and way of life, destroy our economy, or even letting them capture our beloved capital for them to establish a corrupt democracy. We could spy them to prevent rebellion, but it's too late to fully prevent it. Do we disarm them by force or ignore the danger?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31730;Today engagements around the country are starting, and our forces are preparing for an impending civil war. Our people will have to suffer over it, or do we let them live in peace, and have all those "liberties" they want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31736;Today our people have once again risen up, this time in Madrid, our capital.

EVTDESC31741;Today, Barcelona-based Swiss industrialist Hans Gamper has founded what will end up being Futbol Club Barcelona, along with a handful of sports enthusiasts, mainly foreigners, who gathered at Gimnàs Solé after their integration into Català FC was rejected. . The founders included the club's first players: Walter Wild, Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Künzli, Otto Maier, Enrique Ducay, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31742;The lower house of the Spanish Parliament approved the creation of a Commonwealth today, but with limited powers compared to those originally envisioned for it by its promoters. On 18 December 1913 the king signed the law granting all Spanish provinces the right to group themselves into associations or commonwealths, Catalonia being the only commonwealth so planned. The first President of the Commonwealth of Catalonia will be, if done, Enric Prat de la Riba, of the Lliga Regionalista, who will led a program to create an efficient infrastructure of roads and ports, hydraulic works, railways, telephones, charities and healthcare. The Commonwealth also wants to undertook initiatives to increase agricultural and forest yields, introducing technological improvements, the improvement of services and education, and promoting education in technologies necessary for Catalan industry. The last decision is for the Spanish Senate, which depends on us to finish their decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31743;'Spaniards: The enthusiastic welcome that the Liberal Army found in the villages, so heroically shown in Vicálvaro, the applause with which the news of our patriotic uprising has been received everywhere, they assure from now on the triumph of the freedom which we have sworn to defend. In a few days most of the provinces will have shaken the tyrants, the nation will enjoy the benefits of the representative regime. It is time, then, to say what we are determined to do in the matter of victory. We want the preservation of the throne, the rigorous practice of the fundamental laws, tax cuts, we want to uproot the peoples from that centralization, giving them the local independence necessary to preserve their culture, and as a guarantee of all this we want and raise, under solid foundations, the National Militia. These are our attempts, which we express frankly, without imposing them on the nation. We'll lay the definitive foundations of liberal regeneration to which we aspire. We have our swords consecrated to the national will, and we will not sheath them until it is fulfilled.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31744;Inspired by Espartero's patriotic federalist manifesto, the people have risen up against our government and surrounded the King's Palace, forcing us to agree to an armistice and negotiate peace. As we lack support of the populace and the necessary soldiers, the only thing we can do is give the rebels what they want and stop the bloodshed that has struck our great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31745;3 days ago a draft constitution was presented to the progressive parliament and approved. This constitution follows a strongly progressive and liberal ideology, reaffirming the principle of national sovereignty in an absolute way. All institutions, including the Crown, would find their foundation in the will of the Nation, it would also grant a wide range of political rights and install, for the first time in Spain, a religiously tolerant system of governance. Its articulation is broader and more complete than that contained in the Constitution of 1837 and the Constitution of 1845. It is a rigid constitution, as it establishes a rather tedious reform procedure. Regardless, yesterday, General Leopoldo O'Donnell staged a counter-revolution, launching a coup that has put and end to the progressive biennium. He has decreed the closure of the Constituent Assembly elected in 1854 and canceled the Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEGREATGATSBY;The Great Gatsby, a book by Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, has been published today. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan. The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's cover art greatly impressed Fitzgerald and he incorporated aspects of it into the novel. This tragic work of literature is one of the best of the genre and is sure to remain a classic for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHARLESLINDFLIGHT;Charles Lindbergh, an obscure air mail pilot, made history today by completing the first solo flight over the Atlantic from Roosevelt Field, Long Island, to Le Bourget Aerodrome, Paris, in his purpose-built, single-engine Ryan monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis. His monoplane was loaded with 450 U.S. gallons (1,704 liters) of fuel that was strained repeatedly to avoid fuel line blockage. The fully loaded aircraft weighed 2.7 tons (2329 kilograms), with takeoff hampered by a muddy, rain-soaked runway. Lindbergh's monoplane was powered by a J-5C Wright Whirlwind radial engine and gained speed very slowly during its 7:52 AM takeoff, but cleared telephone lines at the far end of the field by about twenty feet. Over the next 33 and a half hours, Lindbergh and the Spirit faced many challenges, which included skimming over storm clouds at 10,000ft (3,000m) and wave tops at as low as 10ft (3m). He landed at Le Bourget Aerodrome at 10:22 PM on Saturday, May 21st. A crowd estimated at 150,000 stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the cockpit, and carried him around above their heads for 'nearly half an hour'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
raise_militia_title;Raise a militia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
raise_militia_desc;Our country is too small to raise a regular army, yet we desperately need armed forces. Conscripting peasants into an improvised irregular militia will result in a very disorganized and unprofessional force, but that will have to do. We must simply hope that in the face of danger, such a motley band would not simply melt into desertion. \n\n§RWarning: You have to merge the brigades that are generated by this decision§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16121916;A team of 12 fearless mountaineers and 60 porters traveled to the foot of Mount Everest and set up a base camp to prepare an ascent. This Mount Everest expedition of 1924 is our second attempt to reach the top of the world after the failure two years prior. Both expeditions have been financed by the Royal Geographical Society, the Alpine Club, and a major contribution by Captain John Noel. After two summit attempts had to be broken off despite setting a world altitude record of 28,126 feet (8572 m), the mountaineers George Mallory and Andrew "Sandy" Irvine set out on a third and final bid for the peak - and were never seen again. The last sighting was Noel Odell's claim to have watched two black dots on the 2nd step (cliff face) of the Northeast ridge, ascending it in roughly 5 minutes. Nobody knows whether they reached the peak before perishing. Today, the surviving expedition members erected a memorial cairn in honor of the men who never returned from Mount Everest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LEMANSSTARTS;Today the first '24 Hours of Le Mans' race has taken place, running along public roads near the name-giving city. It is planned to be a three-year event, the winner being declared by which driver could go the farthest distance over three consecutive 24-hour races, being awarded the Rudge-Whitworth Triennial Cup. For now, winners who covered the largest distance in a single 24-hour race are declared annually. Twenty car manufacturers constructed special racecars for the event, all from France aside from Bentley from Great Britain and Excelsior from Belgium. The victory in the first race went to the Chenard-Walcker team and their Bentley. Although they were delayed by stones smashing a headlight and puncturing the fuel tank, in the end the team of René Léonard / André Lagache and Christian Dauvergne / Raoul Bachmann won a comfortable 1–2 victory. The race has been an excellent exhibition of machine endurance and reliability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOUBAGHLAREVOLT;An insurrection has begun in the mountains surrounding in Benni Abbes against our colonial rule. Intense unrest among Maghrebis and Berbers in the region has lead to civilians supplying the rebels. Chérif Boubaghla, a skilled guerrilla tactician, is at the head of the insurrection, organizing the mountains tribes into raiding parties who ambush our forces and vanish again like strokes of lightning. Today, an attack on Chellata wreaked havoc on the local administration. Sheriff Benali, chief of the Zaouia of Chelatta has reproached our forces for failing to prevent Boubaghla's attack, deciding to join him in rebellion. If we don't do anything, more and more chieftains will begin joining the revolt. The battle for Kabylia has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSASSINATIONAGARFIELD;James A. Garfield, 20th president of the United States, has been shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C.. Garfield was scheduled to leave Washington on for his summer vacation, which was reported in the Washington newspaper. Charles J. Guiteau, a mentally ill lawyer who was fantasizing about Garfield being politically indebted to him therefore knew to lay in wait at the train station, preparing to shoot him. At 9:30AM, as Garfield entered the station's waiting room, Guiteau stepped forward and shot him at point-blank range from behind. Garfield cried out, 'My God, what is that?', flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again, and Garfield collapsed. While Guiteau was quickly arrested, the president has been severly injured, suffering internal hemorrhaging. He will probably not survive to see the end of the year, and that after only having been president for four months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSASSINATIONWMCKINLEY;News has reached us that William McKinley, 25th president of the United States, was shot in the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He was shaking hands with the public when anarchist Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen. McKinley had attended the exhibition to hold speeches with the goal of convincing the attendees of the importance of protective tariffs. Aside from this official purpose, he also took time to enjoy the fair and meet fairgoers in scheduled public receptions such as the one at the Temple of Music that lead to the shooting. McKinley is currently in critical condition. Of the two bullets Czolgosz fired at him, one deflected off a button but the other penetrated his abdomen, lodging in his back. While the bullet itself is no longer dangerous now that it has stopped moving, its path through McKinley's gut is very concerning. If it gets infected, the president doesn't have much longer to live. While doctors are optimistic, McKinley's chances are slim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iasi_national_theatre_title;The Iasi National Theatre;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iasi_national_theatre_desc;The first building in Iasi arranged to host theater performances was the "Théâtre des Variétés" (Variety Theater) built in 1832. As the number of local or passing theatrical troupes increased, the building quickly became too small. Thus, the need for a grand theater the likes of which is common in great European cities has arisen. Construction has been proposed to take place in the building which had served as palace to Ionita Sandu Sturdza, ruler of Moldavia from 1822 to 1828. Architect Alexandru Costinescu has made plans for refitting the ground floor into a huge amphitheater surrounded by three rows of loges and crowned with a gallery and large stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
german_npolarexp2_title;The German North Polar Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
german_npolarexp2_desc;August Petermann, an expert on cartography and geography has proposed an expedition to the North Pole at a Geographic assembly in Frankfurt organized by the 'Freier Deutscher Hochstift'. Petermann firmly believes in the questionable theory of the open polar sea, concluding that beyond a thin belt of drift ice, the sea surrounding the North Pole is itself devoid of ice. Although Petermann ambitiously hopes that the expedition might reach the pole after clearing the purported ice zone and reaching the open sea, it would still be of great academic value to explore and scientifically analyze the waters and islands of the far North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
challenger_exped_title;The Challenger Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
challenger_exped_desc;Charles Wyville Thomson, a Scottish natural historian and marine zoologist of the University of Edinburgh and member of the Royal Society of London has requested use of the HMS Challenger to make a scientific circumnavigation of the globe. Goals of the expedition include discovering new species of marine fauna and flora, conducting deep sea soundings, bottom dredges, open water trawls and serial water temperature observations and surveying and exploring Antarctic waters. The ambitious 127,580km journey requiring a crew of 216 lead by 21 officers would certainly be arduous. Experts have predicted 'a great advance in the knowledge of our planet' would be reached by the expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He is working together with the Geographical Society of Brussels to raise funds but is still sorely in financing. Subsidizing the expedition would make Belgian national prestige involved in the undertaking and ensure that the potential scientific discoveries to be made in Antarctica would not fail due to lack of funding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SISIASSASSINATION;60-year-old Empress Elisabeth, also popularly known as Sisi, traveled incognito to Geneva, where she had been invited to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage. After the death of her only son, Rudolf, in the so-called Mayerling Incident, where he committed murder-suicide together with his lover Baroness Mary Vetsera, she sank deep into melancholy. Elisabeth began wearing long black dresses and carried a white parasol, going on trips throughout Europe to distract herself from her misery. On the fateful day of her arrival in Geneva, as Elisabeth and her lady-in-waiting were walking along a promenade leading to a steamer which they intended to take to cross lake Geneva, 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them. After peering underneath the empress's parasol, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand as if he wanted to maintain his balance. In reality, he stabbed Elisabeth with a four-inch-long sharpened needle file. She died shortly after boarding the steamer, having been Queen for 44 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HALIFAXEXPLOSION;This morning, the SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship laden with high explosives, collided with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo in the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbor to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the Mont-Blanc led to a massive explosion that devastated the Richmond district of Halifax. 1,782 people have been killed, largely in Halifax and Dartmouth, by the blast, debris, fires, or collapsed buildings, and an estimated 9,000 others have been injured. This blast was the largest man-made explosion in history. Preliminary investigations have concluded that both ships were to blame for the collision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EUREKAREBELS;The Victorian gold rush began in 1851, bringing masses of migrants into the area to seek their fortune in the mines. The local government sought to profit from the boom by issuing a mining tax of 30 shillings a month. Furious gold miners organized in protest, eventually escalating to ten thousand people swearing allegiance to a newly proclaimed secessionist republic. The conflict erupted into battle when 280 soldiers engaged 190 miners, resulting in around 50 deaths and the arrest of the agitants. While the worst offenders are now behind bars and the secessionist sentiments have been quelled, this incident has still caught the attention of all of Australia, laying the seeds for future unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Time and time again, tensions have risen over the area due to attempts by our or the British officials to extend administration to the territory, leading to a mutual acceptance of the status quo. Now, the time has come to definitively settle the issue. Proposing an arbitration by the king of Italy should win over the Brits and guarantee a fair outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DINGWUQIHUANG;A famine has lead to the death of about 10 million people - the most to die in a famine in the last 200 years - in the states of Shensi, Shansi, Honan and Shantung, causing huge economic and social downturn. The sale of wives and daughters into human trafficking has become common due to the chaos that has ravaged the region. Traffickers are reported to regularly drive groups of thousands of women South from the barren lands of Shansi and Honan to the East and South. The famine may be caused by opium plantations being placed where rice once grew, lowering rice output available to the populace combined with crop failure caused by a drought due to el Niño. Even a heart of stone should shed tears for the death that has struck us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

His revolt was the last in a long chain of conflicts in the region led by members of his bloodline. His oldest son, Yishanhan Khoja, has assumed the title of 'Kata Tiaole', grand prince of the Khojas. He is gathering forces in one last glorious attempt to capture Kashgar for islam but lacks funding. Sponsoring his holy war would be costly but hopefully a decisive blow against Qing rule in Sinkiang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QIHEZHUOREBELLION;With support from the Khanate of Kokand, Kata Tiaole, the heir to the Khoja dynasty which we drove from Sinkiang in 1759, has invaded over the mountains and captured the city of Kashgar. The Khojas have long been a thorn in our side, last invading the area in 1830. If we defeat them decisively here and now on the field of battle, we may be rid of them for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAGASAKIINCIDENT1;The Beiyang fleet docked in Nagasaki in a visit as part of their tour of various major Asian harbors as a show of force. 500 sailors took part in shore leave, going to the red-light district, where during an altercation with locals, they were blamed for damaged fixtures. Locals also claimed that drunken sailors went around the city pursuing women and children, causing an outrage. Nagasaki Prefecture Police Department tried to intervene together with a large number of local civilians. As a result, the policemen and sailors, using swords purchased from stores, began to fight hand-to-hand in sword battles within the city, causing at least 80 deaths. This is sure to cause diplomatic tensions with Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAVITEMUTINY;A dangerous trend in the Philippines has become apparent: the willingness for Filipinos to resist Spanish rule through armed revolt, including those in the colonial army and workforce. Today, around 200 Filipinos staged a mutiny in Cavite's San Felipe Fort. These rebels primarily were soldiers and laborers employed in the Cavite arsenal, the latter of whom deeply resented how their exemption from paying tribute to the Spanish government was revoked. Other grievances included the refusal by the Spanish to pay for tobacco from Filipino farmers as well as the use of forced labor. The mutiny, nevertheless, was unsuccessful, and our troops executed many of the participants. The Catholic priests turned mutiny leaders Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora--collectively known as Gomburza--have in particular become immortalized as martyrs after their execution, since the Filipinos assert these men were not given a fair trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_shakespeare_title;Shakespear's Mission to Khiva;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_shakespeare_desc;Russia has long been scheming to conquer the Khanate of Khiva. While their last attempt in 1717 was pushed back, news has reached us of a large force gathering in Orenburg that is clearly being assembled for a march across the steppe into Khiva. Russia's primary justification for their aggression against the Khanate is their holding of many Russian fishermen captured from the eastern Caspian as slaves. Major d'Arcy Todd of our mission to Herat has suggested sending his political assistant, Richmond Campbell Shakespear, as an emissary to Khiva to attempt to convince the Khan to release the Russian slaves, thus removing the Russian pretext for war. However, we do not know whether Russia will already have invaded Khiva by the time he would arrive, nor whether he would be able to survive the dangerous journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEAREINKHIVA;An strangely-clothed man has arrived in Khiva from the southern desert, claiming to be a representative from the distant country known as Great Britain. He urges Khan Allah Quli Bahadur to issue an order to release all Russian slaves in our domain so he may bring them across the steppe to the Russian frontier. His reasoning is that Russia is angered by our keeping of the slaves, around 450 in number, and is thus likely to invade us in the near future if we insist on keeping them. Indeed, Russia has on several occasions demanded that we release our Russian slaves. Should we follow the recommendations of this strange man and let him take them to Russia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARENOTINKHIVA;It has been a long time since Richmond Shakespear set out North from Herat to try to reach Khiva in an attempt to persuade the Sultan to release his Russian slaves, thus depriving the Tsardom of a pretext for war. Sadly, we have heard nothing back from him. He evidently perished on the dangerous journey across the lawless tribal lands on his path North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARESUCCESFULRUS;A bedraggled group of 416 former slaves has arrived at one of our forts on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea led by a Brit by the name of Richmond Campbell Shakespear. He claims to have traveled from Herat up the Oxus on a mission to persuade the khan of Khiva to release his Russian slaves, an endeavor which he succeeded in. While morally just and an excellent outcome for the freed slaves, this move on the board of the Great Game was clearly meant by the Brits to deprive us of our reason to invade Khiva.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARESUCCESFULENG;Richmond Campbell Shakespear has arrived on a ship from St. Petersburg to a celebratory welcome in London. After traveling from Herat along the Oxus to Khiva, he met with the Khan who he reports to have been a gentleman, not at all the cruel tyrant he was rumored to be. After some deliberation, the khan agreed to let Shakespear journey across the steppe to the Russian frontier with the slaves. The Russians, while glad to have their people back, were obviously angered to have lost their pretext to invade Khiva. Thanks to Shakespear's heroism, we have gained an edge in the struggle of the Great Game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUBARALSITRI;The Shi'ite cleric Shubar al-Sitri was pushed out Bahrain today after a failed coup attempt to bring the country under Persia's sphere of influence. He had gathered weapons from the northern Arabian towns al-Hasa and Qatif to do so, then attempted to negotiate a collaboration with the Persian Shah, Nasser al-Din Qajar. But while al-Sitri was given support from the Shah, he failed to receive enough manpower due to Persia's preoccupation with contesting the European powers and maintaining internal stability. The failed coup, nevertheless, brought much bloodshed, with scores of Bedouin tribesmen fleeing to Qatar for refuge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VICEROYMAYODED;Richard Burke, 6th Earl of Mayo, the Viceroy of India, was assassinated today in Port Blair, Andaman Islands, during an inspection of the port's penal settlement. The assassin was a convict there, named Sher Ali Afridi, a Punjabi veteran of the British Army serving life in prison for murdering a relative during a feud. His murder of Lord Mayo was part of his plan to avenge his incarceration by killing two high-ranking British officials, since he thought the life sentence was too severe. Lord Mayo's body is being prepared for its return to his native Ireland, while Afridi awaits execution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEATHHAWYARD;News has reached us that George W. Hayward was murdered while passing through Chitral. He was on his way north to map the desolate Pamir mountains. Officials had warned him of the danger awaiting him in many of the lawless areas he would pass through, but he proceeded anyway, even carrying with him expensive gifts for Pamiri rulers to endear them to the Brits. These gifts would also, however, make him a target. After passing through Chitral and entering the mountains to the North, Hayward was said to have been ambushed by Chitrali tribesmen who murdered him in cold blood and looted his gifts. They were said to have been delivered to the amir of Chitral, who is rumored to have been complicit in the killing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STODDARTKIDNAPPED;Reports have reached us about yet another humiliating loss of a British diplomat in our interminable quest to win the upper hand in Central Asia. Colonel Charles Stoddart has been kidnapped and imprisoned on orders of Emir Nasrullah Khan of Bukhara. Initially dispatched to negotiate a treaty of friendship with Britain and the release of Russian prisoners, Stoddart was taken utterly by surprise by his arrest. We suspect Nasrullah wishes to use Stoddart as a pawn to persuade Britain to leave Central Asia. We can send in another diplomat to plea for Stoddart's release, though it's unlikely we could negotiate it and still keep a good standing in Bukhara. Captain Arthur Conolly would do for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STODDARKLLD;Our bid to rescue Charles Stoddart has come to a tragic end. Failing to negotiate Stoddart's release, Captain Arthur Conolly has himself been arrested, and both men have been beheaded for spying for Britain. Stoddart was put through hell over his time in prison, kept in a twenty-foot-deep hole infested with vermin with other common criminals. The conditions of his imprisonment changed with the Emir's fickle mind, which in turn flip-flopped as he estimated Britain's power in Central Asia, then abused Stoddart accordingly when we were at a geopolitical disadvantage. The pleas of Britain, Russia, the Ottomans, and even Khiva and Kokand could not persuade the Emir to release him. May both men rest in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;

TASHKENTJERUSSIA;Sometimes mutiny can be for the better. General Mikhail Cherniaev has acted against our order not to advance on Tashkent, sieging it over two days despite a stiff defense. He has allowed Russia to annex Tashkent as an autonomous khanate, and he shall be rewarded for his efforts with medals. Nevertheless, we should replace him to ensure our future orders are followed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALE;After a French cargo ship carrying 98 tons of goods capsized off the coast of Salé, Morocco, a few tons of the cargo were salvaged and stored in Salé itself. For us to have believed these goods would be kept safe, though, was foolish: the locals are scavenging the goods with abandon with little interference from Moroccan authorities. This is a clear act of piracy and merits punishment. All we have to do is say the words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALEMOR;The French have voiced outrage at locals in Salé for alleged piracy. After one of their cargo ships capsized and some of its goods were transported to the city, residents began to loot them with minimal interference from our authorities. France demands compensation, which if denied would mean a strong military action from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALEREPAID;Morocco has agreed to compensate us for the stolen goods. We have no more of a quarrel with them for now, though let it be clear that we will exact concessions from them if they ever challenge our authority again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TROLLINGINSALE;Morocco has refused to compensate us for the stolen goods. They have no business escalating this tension, should they not wish to have our military unleashed upon them. Their wrongs must be made right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVENGEFORSALE;France has heavy-handedly responded to our refusal to compensate them, navally bombarding Salé as revenge. With the only thing preventing their military from descending on us like demons out the gates of hell being their restraint, we are totally at Paris's mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRETEONEEIGHTFOURONE;With the Greek mainland having firmly established its independence, calls for the reunification of the Greek island of Crete with the Greek mainland have been growing louder. During the Greek Revolution, the island fell into rebel hands, but was recaptured eventually. The Cretans, as rebellious as ever, have petitioned the Great Powers to sponsor a revolt for their independence, most notably Britain, who is rumored to have designs on the island to expand their naval presence in the Mediterranean. Undeservedly confident in their odds of liberation, an uprising has erupted in Crete--one which, needless to say, must be smothered in its infancy before it becomes too dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
india_je_russia_title;The Duhamel Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
india_je_russia_desc;General Alexander Osipovich Duhamel proposes a radical response to the war with Britain: an invasion of British India. The plan would involve a primary route through Persia and Afghanistan into India by means of the Khyber Pass, which leads into the Peshawar Valley. Duhamel hopes that Russia could build an alliance with the Sikh Empire and prod the locals into a rebellion against the British, particularly the Muslims of Northern and Western India. The plan also has seven alternate routes that make use of passage through Persia and the Turkic sultanates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIA;Russia has formally requested access to our territory in hopes of passing through to India for an invasion. Such an invasion is part of its campaign against the British in the Crimean War: Russia intends to create a new front for them to relieve their siege on the Russian mainland. Should we accept, though, it could mean allowing Russia to build influence in our country without any restraint due to the great powers' intervention. Our people surely would not approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIAACCEPTS;Our request to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been accepted: we now may turn the war's tide by invading India. We will bring Britannia to its knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIAREFUSES;Our request to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been denied. Our daring invasion plan must now be put to rest, unless we were to go to war with $FROM$ to force them to change their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CANVUONGMOVEMENT;A large-scale rebellion against our rule in Vietnam has broken out. The rebels have christened their effort as the Cân Vuong Movement, with Cân Vuong meaning "Aid the king." With this said, the revolt lacks centralization, no doubt due to the heavy regional autonomy the Kingdom of Vietnam was given prior to our campaign to annex it. Its activities primarily involve regional leaders' troops attacking our forces. Of course, any violence against our noble troops must be met with a devastating response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MISSIONOFTHEVIXEN;The British schooner Vixen was detained today off the Caucasian coast by the Russian brig Ajax. The detention comes as a result of foreign vessels being barred from entry into Turkish waters past the Dardanelles, per the 1830 Treaty of Adrianopole. The Vixen had eight on-board guns and 28,000 pounds of gunpowder confiscated by Russian authorities. The British consul of Constantinople, David Urquhart, was on board the schooner as it was captured. \n\nWhen looking between the lines of this incident, however, there is a whole other dimension to it. It seems the Vixen's detention was set up by Urquhart to provoke a conflict with Russia. The native Circassian peoples of the Caucasus have British support for their independence, and their liberation would do a service to British trade with Turkey and around the Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MISSIONOFTHEVIXENRUSNO;Russia has refused to release the Vixen and David Urquhart. Such an escalation could certainly mean war--and we must choose our reaction wisely. Will we use this opportunity to fight on behalf of Circassia to advance our interests in the Black Sea, regardless of how many casualties we may face against the Russian Bear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANKINKOTAI;Sankin Kotai is a system obligating all daimyo to have permanent residences in Edo to enforce their fealty to the Shogun. Edo has a reputation for its opulent processions as these men make their daily commutes, with thousands of nobles entering and departing the city each day. Dissatisfaction with the Shogun's policies, however, has led to this system becoming less effective, evidenced by how unstable the relationship between the Shogun and daimyo currently is. It is best to have tradition take a back seat and let the daimyo live wherever they wish. They will thank us in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREECEEIGHTEENSIXTYTWO;King Otto, our previous monarch, has been overthrown in a popular revolt. However, the Greek people are not entirely opposed to life under a monarchy. For this reason, the government proposes holding a plebiscite for electing a new king. There are several options we could choose from among the royal families of Britain, Germany, France, Denmark, and Russia. Perhaps a popular monarch hailing from one of the Western European great powers would help us regain Greek land under foreign control. However, it could also bring us into conflict with Europe due to the 1832 London Conference barring Britain, France, and Russia from allowing their royals to claim our throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DANISHKINGGREECE;Prince William of Denmark has gladly accepted the throne! Though not a top choice when our people are surveyed for their preferred candidate, William is uncontroversial and well ingratiated to the great powers. From hereon, he will be known as George I. May his reign be marked by the restoration of Greek sovereignty to our lost territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGLISHKINGGREECE;After deposing Otto I in a popular revolt, Greece has held a plebiscite for electing a new king. As it turns out, the vote's winner has been announced to be our own Prince Alfred of Edinburgh. Alfred is an immensely popular candidate due to the Greeks' conviction that having a British royal on their throne would mean the return of the Ionian Islands, one of our protectorates, to Greek sovereignty.\n\nHowever, his coronation would breach the 1832 London Conference's terms, which prevent any British, French, or Russian royal from claiming the Greek throne. Is it in our best interest to violate this pact in the name of goodwill toward Greece?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGREFUSESGREKING;Unfortunately, the United Kingdom has refused to allow Prince Alfred of Edinburgh to be crowned our king. They do so in light of the London Conference of 1832 and the staunch opposition of Queen Victoria herself, whose reasons only God knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGLISHKINGGREECEGRE;Prince Alfred of Edinburgh has accepted the throne! Alfred is by far the most popular choice for King, due to his belonging to the British royal family. Our people hope his coronation will convince Britain to cede us the Ionian Islands, which remain a protectorate of theirs, as well as possibly go to war with us against the Ottomans to liberate other Greek lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGLISHKINGGREECEGPS;Following King Otto's deposition in a popular revolt, Greece has elected Prince Alfred of Edinburgh as the new King of the Greeks. While Alfred boasts huge popularity, his coronation would breach the 1832 London Conference's terms, which prevent any British, French, or Russian royal from claiming the Greek throne. This development endangers our economic influence in Greece. It could mean the unification of the British and Greek monarchies, giving them an undeserved advantage in the Mediterranean. We might need to take a strong diplomatic or even military action in protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSSIANKINGGREECE;After deposing Otto I in a popular revolt, Greece has held a plebiscite for electing a new king. As it turns out, the vote's winner has been announced to be our own Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich. Nicholas has some support as a claimant due to his Orthodox faith, which most Greeks also follow. Should he be crowned King of Greece, it would bring Russian economic ties to that country closer than ever before. However, it would also violate the 1832 London Conference's stipulation that no British, French, nor German royal may claim the Greek throne. Shall we still honor this pact?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSREFUSESGREKING;Unfortunately, Russia has refused to allow Duke Nicholas of Leuchtenberg to be crowned our king. They cite the 1832 London Conference's terms as their reason. We will need to seek other means to fulfill our dream of a fully restored Greece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSSIANKINGGREECEGRE;Grand Duke Nicholas of Leuchtenberg has accepted the Greek throne! His coronation will be a boon to the Orthodox faith, both in Greece and elsewhere. His Russian origin will also bring us closer economically and diplomatically, which can come in handy. Perhaps a Russian alliance is in order?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSSIANKINGGREECEGPS;Following King Otto's deposition in a popular revolt, Greece has elected Duke Nicholas of Russia as the mew King of the Greeks. His Orthodox faith is cited as the primary reason for his candidacy as monarch, since Russia and Greece share Orthodox Christianity as a majority faith. With all this said, his coronation breaches the 1832 London Conference, which bars Britain, France, and Russia from allowing any of their royals from claiming the Greek throne. This development endangers our economic influence in Greece. It could mean the unification of the Russian and Greek monarchies, giving them an undeserved advantage in the Mediterranean. We might need to take a strong diplomatic or even military action in protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHKINGGREECE;Jérôme Bonaparte of France has accepted the throne! A member of the the same family line as the famed Napoleon I, his family name carries immense prestige and will be a boon to relations with France. Let us hope this Bonaparte also has some of the military genius his family's patriarch went down in history for. We will need it in our future liberation of all our former lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RIYAHDLIBERATION;The Emirates of Jabal Shammar and Nejd historically have been locked in an unending dispute over control of the Arabian desert, though this conflict once again burst into warfare today as Jabal Shammar advanced on the Nejdi capital, Riyadh. This has pushed Nejd's ruling family, the House of Saud, into exile in Kuwait and left Riyadh ripe for annexation. With Jabal Shammar growing so regionally powerful, it is no longer ideal for us to maintain its vassalage and expect them to honor our suzerainty over them. If we do so, it might provoke the Ottomans into a conflict with us over dominance in Arabia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAMMARLIBERATION;With our occupation of Nejd, we are now the most powerful emirate in the Arabian Peninsula. For this reason, Egypt has announced the termination of our vassal status under them, fearing that continuing to give us their military and diplomatic support would cause conflict with the Ottomans. Not like this matters to us, though, now that we are independent. If the Ottomans want a fight, we will cross that bridge when we come to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CHANGHUAQUAKE;Destruction has wrought Changhua after a powerful earthquake struck the northwestern Taiwanese county. The tremor has wrought destruction to local houses and temples, claiming about 1,030 lives in the process. Funds must be gathered in order to rebuild this area of central Taiwan, which now resembles a wasteland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1894SANJUANEARTHQUAKE;The Northeast of the province of San Juan has been struck by the strongest earthquake in our recorded history. In the city of San Juan, the Cathedral's left bell tower collapsed and the public clock, which has worked since 1824, broke for the first time. The temples of Santo Domingo, San Agustín, Dolores and San Pantaleón have suffered serious damage. Many houses as well as public buildings such as the town hall, the public market, the provincial legislature and the Franklin Library are in ruins. Even towns over 500km away from the epicenter suffered minor damage. In all, 112 people fell victim to the earthquake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAINANQUAKE;Another powerful earthquake unleashed its wrath on the tropical island of Taiwan, this time in Tainan, Chiayi County. It has resulted in over 1,000 deaths and the collapse of over 8,000 homes. A province with such a volatile environment ought to be invested in further to avoid being run into the ground by these earthquakes. If Taiwan continues to be destroyed by Mother Nature, she will surely never emerge from her reputation as a backwater of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAICHAOCHUEN;The recent rebellions show us that secret societies have immense power within our nation and can easily stir up agitation. The aristocrat Tai Chao Chuen, a member of the Tai clan, has collaborated with other wealthy men to form branches of the Tiandihui, rebelling against Qing rule in response to the society's suppression on the mainland. Redeeming the Qing's legitimacy in these people's eyes is futile--the rabble must be put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;
PROPOSALBUYTAIWAN;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with an offer to purchase Taiwan. They say having the island under $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would help counter European economic power in Asia and bring them closer to global dominance. Due to the island being dominated by rural frontiers, inhabited by aboriginals who do not respect our governance, it is tempting to accept the offer. However, can the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ be trusted to not meddle further in Chinese affairs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PROPOSALBUYTAIWANONE;Formosa is now in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ hands! We'd best get to mining that coal and sulfur right away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PROPOSALBUYTAIWANTWO;Formosa remains a Chinese province. We will have to search for riches elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DANANAOINCIDENT;Opium is the scourge of our society, second only to Europeans. The two combined are a plague a million times over. German opium trader James Milisch and his British partner, James Horn, got the government's attention today as it was revealed the two had started a complex operation in Nan'ao, Yilan County, Taiwan. The men made an agreement with local aborigines to set aside land for a private colony, where opium could be produced and traded under the natives' protection. These white men chase profit tenaciously. Let us send a message: the Chinese people will no longer be swindled by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
purchase_taiwan_title;The Formosa Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
purchase_taiwan_desc;Our admirals see great potential for expanding our influence in East Asia. After an expedition to Japan, some of our sailors docked in Keelung, on the Chinese island of Formosa (known in Chinese as Taiwan), to inspect coal deposits and assess their potential for mining. They report that the island is both highly lucrative and easy to defend, making it a perfect colony. It would also counteract the expansion of European markets in Asia--putting us more prominently on the world stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THELIONHEAD;Our countless internal rebellions over this century prove how quickly our authority disintegrates when challenged. In Taiwan particularly, our administration fails to reign in the local populace, leaving the Taiwanese aboriginals free to live on their tribal land under no Chinese jurisdiction. \n\nWe have dispatched an expedition to forcibly bring civilization to the aboriginals, encountering resistance from the Paiwan tribesmen around Shizi Township and Pingtung County, but ultimately winning an overwhelming victory. A new construction project to solidify a Qing presence in Taiwan has been begun, greatly hindering any attempt by a colonizing country to erase the fact that Taiwan will forever be culturally Chinese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FOURCOUNTIESREB;Taiwan's population is a mix of immigrants from across southern China, with people from different provinces taking on different identities in Taiwanese society. Normally these groups do not experience ethnic tension, but the residents of Mengjia, primarily Minnan immigrants from Quanzhou, now find themselves resistant to building community with new residents moving from nearby Bajiazhuang, who are mostly immigrants from Tong'an. Tensions have escalated between the two over tribalistic community identity. For example, Mengjia residents worship their own patron god at the local temple, whom the Tong'an migrants reject. The two also have competed for docking rights at Mengjia Wharf to trade with the mainland. Soon enough this tension erupted into gang-like violence. Bajiazhuang was burnt down in a riot, and its former residents in Mengjia have been pushed out to settle in Dadaocheng, another coastal suburb.;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENT;After four Ryukyuan tributary ships departed from Okinawa, a typhoon caused the ships to change course and led to one being wrecked off western Taiwan, leaving 66 survivors. These men found themselves heading into the territory of the Paiwan aboriginals of Taiwan, where they were robbed and executed. Only twelve survived--they managed to hide from their attackers and were later brought back to the Ryukyus to testify to our government about the incident. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTQNG;After four Ryukyuan tributary ships departed from Okinawa, a typhoon caused the ships to change course and led to one being wrecked off western Taiwan, leaving 66 sailors stranded. These men found themselves heading into the territory of the Paiwan aboriginals of Taiwan, where they were robbed and executed. Only twelve survived--they managed to hide from their attackers and were later brought back to the Ryukyus.\n\nJapan is demanding compensation for these sailors' deaths, despite how the Ryukyus are not Japanese territories and, in fact, are one of our tributaries. Additionally, our administration has made little effort to bring the Taiwanese aboriginals under Chinese rule, and they can therefore be dismissed as outside our state's control--eliminating our need to take responsibility. Nevertheless, how should we respond to Japan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTONE;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to compensate us for the sailors' deaths. This historic occasion marks the first time that China has bowed to Japan. By agreeing to our demands, they have shown their weakness in comparison to our rapidly modernizing army and navy. Maybe one day soon we will be able to wrest Taiwan from China's grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTTWO;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to compensate us for the sailors' deaths. They assert that, as non-Han subjects of living in isolated tribal land, they are "outside the realm of civilization." Therefore, the Chinese state exerts no control over them and cannot be held responsible for their actions. Perhaps we must make them pay at gunpoint?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTNOWAR;Despite their anger at our refusal to pay an indemnity, Japan does not wish to escalate this incident to war. We respect their decision--it certainly was a smart one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUDANINCIDENTWAR;Japan has declared war over our refusal to pay an indemnity over the 54 executed Ryukyuan sailors. It seems they will have the whole island of Taiwan before they let China off for these aborigines' crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HEICUOTEMPLE;Today, Qing troops led by Lin Zexu marched over to Heicuo Temple, a Tibetan Buddhist temple in Amdo, to crush an anti-Qing rebel group congregating there. The soldiers worked with unfettered brutality: they burnt the temple to the ground, raized the nearby village, and massacred rebels and civilians alike. We will watch with anticipation how the everpresent Tibetan resistance reacts to this event--and their realization of how easily their resistance to the Qing's might crumbles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LINZEXUOPIUM;Under the guidance of administrator Lin Zexu, Qing officials are beginning a confiscation of all opium trafficked on the Pearl River bank in Humen, Dongguan. The confiscation has already drawn up several hundred tons of opium unloaded from British cargo ships. \n\nThe Emperor has ordered that every person caught partaking in the opium trade in China shall be executed. With the side effects of the drug being so severe, including death from withdrawal, it is the least we can do right this injustice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SLAVERYOUTPORTUGAL;Following a treaty between between us for the joint suppression of the slave trade, the United States and Britain have started pressuring our government to outlaw slavery. Refusing would severely endanger our centuries-long alliance with the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATVERMONTFLOOD;During an average monthly rainfall 150% above normal in the state, Vermont has been hit by a flood that is engulfing much of its buildings and streets. The flood also has destroyed infrastructure that the state government has failed to provide funds to repair, creating tension between local politicians and residents. It is estimated that Vermont's towns received on average more than six inches of rain during the flood so far. Somerset is bearing the worst, at one point experiencing a whopping 9.86 inches on record.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RAKOVICAREVOLT;The Croatian politician Eugen Kvaternik, founder of the nationalist Party of Rights, was executed today for inciting a rebellion to liberate Croatia from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. After marching with sympathizers through villages such as Rakovica, Brocanac, and Dreznik, Kvaternik led an attack on the guarded village of Plaski to create a contiguous line of Croatian land that would join his independence movement. In response, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government sent in a regiment to deal with the rebels, promptly arresting Kvaternik and other high-level participants. Such is the fate of nationalist movements in large empires: they hit hard, then fall harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FENIANRAIDSNAMERICA;As if the feud between Britain and its brutally subjugated domain of Ireland could not get worse, America itself has been caught in the fray. An Irish Republican terrorist group called the Fenian Brotherhood, consisting of Irish-American immigrants, launched incursions into Canada to attack British Army forts, attempting to pressure us to withdraw from their homeland. Several raids were launched in Canada East, Canada West, and New Brunswick by the Fenian Brotherhood, though each failed to push out our troops entirely. These radicals are willing to start a guerrilla war and drag the United States into it by having it serve as their home of operations. It's certainly a relief that they are too incompetent to actually accomplish their goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KRIVOSIJEUPRISING;With the Wehrgesetz (Defence Act) being extended to the mountainous region of Krivošije, north of Kotor, fighting has broken out between our troops and the tribesmen inhabiting the area. With help from their compatriots in Montenegro and some bands from Herzegovina, the Krivošije rebels have defeated the several detachments sent against them, humiliating the army and strengthening the rebels' resolve. The conflict has been resolved via a peace treaty, which was signed at Knežlaz, with the rebels officially surrendering to General Rodic but being allowed to keep their weapons and pardoned for their revolt. With the conscription intended by the Wehrgesetz abandoned, the campaign has brought us nothing but humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELLENACOLONYBRU;American business interests have offered to buy the remote northern reaches of our realm in exchange for a hefty sum. They seek to develop the region into a colony. Should we accept their offer and give them the Api region?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELLENACOLONY;Two American businessmen, Joseph Torrey and Thomas Harris, have erected a small farming colony along the coast of the remote island of Borneo. Named the “Ellena Colony," it aims to make a profit through the export of sugarcane. However, the spread of tropical diseases such as malaria through the colony have spelled financial disaster, and its owners seek to sell it. Although it is a significant investment, an American presence in the East Indies could have its rewards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ELLENACOLONYAUS;German adventurer and businessman Baron von Overbeck has offered us the chance to purchase a large and remote colony on the northern coast of Borneo. Acquired from a failed American venture and purchases from the sultanates of Sulu and Brunei, Overbeck's colony certainly has some strategic and economic importance, but its remote location is worrying, and local cooperation is unlikely...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Along with Gibraltar, it ensures us a safe port in the Mediterranean on the route to the Suez canal to India. The construction of a line of fortifications between the populated Southeast of the island and the more hilly, defensible Northwest has been proposed. They would be dubbed 'The Victoria Lines', named after our beloved queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HAWAIIANREVIVAL;Spurred on by the Great Awakening in the United States, many devout preachers have come to our kingdom and inspired a tremendous rise in religious fervor. The initially small congregations established in the 1810s and 20s have seen massive turnouts, large scale baptisms and prayers have begun, and islanders have reported holy miracles and visions. The great Christian awakening has truly taken hold in Hawai'i.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIANRIGHTS;"God hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the earth, in unity and blessedness. God has also bestowed certain rights alike on all men and all chiefs, and all people of all lands." These are some of the rights which He has given alike to every man and every chief of correct deportment; life, limb, liberty, freedom from oppression; the earnings of his hands and the productions of his mind, not however to those who act in violation of the laws.” \nKing Kamehameha III has issued a declaration of the rights inherent to the citizens of Hawai'i. Inspired by the republicanism and constitutional monarchies of the western powers, old traditions of absolute rule have begun to fade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KILAUEAGOESBOOM;“The hideous immensity itself, independent of the many frightful images which it embraced, almost caused an involuntary closing of the eyes against it. But when to the sight is added the appalling effect of the various unnatural and fearful noises, the muttering and sighing, the groaning and blowing, the every agonized struggling, of the mighty action within, as a whole, it is too horrible. And for the first moment I felt like one of my friends, who, on reaching the brink, recoiled, and covered his face, exclaiming, ‘Call it weakness, or what you please, but I cannot look again.'” - Stewart's Journal of a Residence in the Sandwich Islands \nA great eruption of the volcano Kilauea has occurred, sending ash into the sky for twenty six days and nights, and reportedly allowing newspapers to be read by night as far away as Hilo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It shall be written in a manner that allows for the common people to have some choice in government, while still giving the majority of the power to the king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIANDOLAR;Until now, our population has mostly relied on traditional means of exchange or foreign currency for economic activity. However, the Kingdom has recently issued a number of coins bearing the face of our king, representing the new “Hawaiian Dollar.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEASLESNOO;Although colonial diseases have been endemic ever since our first contact with the Europeans, an outbreak of measles has spread throughout the islands at an alarming rate, killing mainly native Hawaiians. The devastation has brought rural life to its knees, and allowed for plantations to acquire more land from dead and dying villages. \nIn time, the pandemic may clear, but for now measles rules Hawai'i.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LATTERSAINTSHAWAII;A strange religious movement has spread to Hawai'i. Missionaries from the Church of Latter Day Saints, colloquially known as “Mormons,” have settled in our kingdom. Although Christian, they have faced great persecution for their divergent beliefs from the rest of Protestant Christianity. Despite this, they have received some accolades for their actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

great_mahele_desc;The old land management system of ancient times has grown inadequate for our modernizing nation. The arrival of plantations, mills, and industry has clashed with our past system of communal land ownership. We will privatize much of this land, and allow it to be sold to private and foreign interests in order to develop our kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHINESEMIGRATION;With war and strife taking hold of China, many laborers have come to Hawai'i to seek refuge and employment. Plantation owners and industrialists will no doubt make use of their labor, especially as the native population declines from decades of disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

KAMEHAMEHATHIRDDIES;Today is a tragic day for our kingdom. The King of the Hawaiian Islands, Kamehameha III, has suddenly passed at the age of forty.

EOLAKEALIIKEAKUA;“Ke Akua Mana Mau, Ho'omaika'i, pomaika'i, I ka mo'i .” \nSince the time of Kamehameha I, our kingdom has traditionally used the British “God Save the King” as our royal anthem. However, the English anthem has sparked some concerns over the abandonment of our native tongue. In recognition of this, Prince Lunalilo has penned a translation of the tune into the native Hawaiian tongue to be used in its place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHURCHOFHAWAII;Inspired by the United Kingdom's Church of England, a proposal has reached us about the foundation of a state-backed “Church of Hawaii” in the Anglican tradition. Although this will surely anger the followers of other Protestant branches, it will greatly please the British investors and missionaries in our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HEMELELAHUIHAWAII;“E mau ke ea o ka 'aina, Ma kou pono mau, A ma kou mana nui, E ola e ola ka mo'i .” \nSeeking to further distance ourselves from European national traditions and into a unique national identity, Princess Lili'uokalani has penned a new anthem for our kingdom. Well liked by King Kamehameha V, the sheet music of this new air has been published and spread across our isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MOOLELOHAWAII;The Catholic writer and historian Zepherin Kepelino Keauokalani has published a four-part compilation of Hawaiian oral histories in the native tongue, using knowledge gleaned from his family lineage of kahuna and ali'i. At a time where French and English literature has been widely distributed, native Hawaiian publishing is a source of national pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAMEHAMEHAFIFTHDIES;The steadfast and ambitious king Kamehameha V has breathed his last. A traditionalist to the end, his throne is now held by the elected King Lunalilo, a beloved figure who has been christened “the People's King”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LUNALILODIES;King Lunalilo's reign was not to last. Perpetually of poor health and chronically alcoholic, he had contracted tuberculosis not even a year into his reign. Today he has died at his private residence in Honolulu. The ambitious and daring Kalakaua has been elected in his stead, seeking to turn Hawai'i into a true power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RECIPROCITYTREATYHAW;American industrialist and diplomatic efforts have pressured our king into signing the "Reciprocity Treaty" with the United States, promising the Americans use of Pearl Harbor and the establishment of free trade partnership. Although the king believes this to be necessary for further investment and advancement, some Hawaiian legislators are outraged, calling it a "nation-snatching treaty.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIPONOII;"Makua lani e, Kamehameha e, Na kaua e pale, Me ka ihe.”\nOur King Kalakaua has written a new air to our kingdom by the title of "Hawai'i Pono'i", replacing the previous song by Princess Liliuokalani.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PORTUGUESEARRIVALSHAW;Alongside the arrival of Chinese and American workers, a new group has shown up on the plantations of Hawai'i: sugarcane workers from Portugal. Many of them hail from the Azores and Madeira, and most were initially sailors who chose to settle down overseas. They bring with them their traditional music, language, and love of malasada, a sweet baked good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UKELELECREATED;A new instrument has gained prominence in the folk music of our kingdom, inspired by the small guitars and lutes brought over by Portuguese immigrants. The ukulele is a small four-string instrument, and has seen some acclaim overseas. Many American and British musicians and instrument dealers have saught to purchase authentic ukuleles, due to their growing prominence as a Hawaiian cultural symbol and association with the Hula dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REMOVALOFGIBSON;Many American industrial interests have taken issue with a particular cabinet minister, a man named Walter M. Gibson. A leader of a Mormon missionary group, the American-born Gibson has become a close ally of King Kalakaua, having served in so many various positions that local newspapers have dubbed him "the minister of everything." Gibson's particularly close friendship with the King has however ruffled many American feathers, as a staunch supporter of the king. A petition has recently arrived from several leading business interests, demanding his immediate removal from all governmental positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIANRIFLESWARMWELCOMINGJK;Ruling at threat of fire, the Honolulu Rifles have marched on the royal palace. Nearly hanging the despised minister Walter Gibson, the Rifles have forced a full cabinet shuffle, and have begun issuing demands to our king. Powerless to stop them, and with the great powers tending to support the Rifle's ambitions, our king has no choice but to agree to many of their demands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BAYONETCONSTITUTION;Yet another constitution has entered into force in our kingdom. Unlike the prior sets of constitutions, it has not come from a reform movement, nor from the ambitions of our kings. Rather, the so-called "Bayonet Constitution" has been forced upon the Kingdom by the Hawaiian Rifles and a shadowy cabal of business interests known as the Citizen's Committee of Safety. Massively restricting the power of the King and repealing many of the recent reforms brought to the kingdom, our king and citizens alike fear for the future of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIANREDSHIRTS;Prince Robert Wilcox, returned from military training in Italy, has created a new political and military organization inspired by the exploits of Garibaldi. Officially known as the Liberal Patriotic Association, the "Hawaiian Redshirts" have created quite a stir among the planters and investors, fearing a counter-coup. The LPA has received a great deal of support from the local Chinese population, who had their suffrage removed by the new constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRSTWILCOX;Wilcox and his redshirts have marched on the 'Iolani Palace today, backed by a small artillery battery, a hundred militiamen, and a desire to reclaim control of Hawaii from the western powers. Taking up positions around the capital, intense street fighting has begun between the Royal Guard and the redshirts. King Kalakaua, while supporting the rebellion's aims, has shown skepticism due to rumor that Wilcox intends to replace him with his sister Liliuoka.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRSTWILCOXSUCCESS;The Royal Guard have fought valiantly, but the redshirts have emerged victorious in Honolulu, and have ordered the repeal of the Bayonet Constitution. While the plantation owners and investors look on in dismay, the uprising is greeted with great acclaim by the native and Asian immigrant populations, to whom Wilcox has become a national hero in the struggle against the foreign powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRSTWILCOXLOSES;The Hawaiian Rifles have sprang into action and defeated Wilcox's redshirts. While the man himself has been acquitted at trial due to popular sympathies, the Big Five have preserved their influence and government and continue to curtail the strength of the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KALAKAUADIES;King Kalakaua, having declining health for the past few years, has died from a stroke while traveling overseas. As a massive public funeral is arranged in Honolulu for the "Merry Monarch", his sister Liliuokalani now takes the throne as the first reigning queen of Hawaii. While the western powers circle like vultures, who knows for sure what the future holds for our nation and our queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INTERVENEINHAWAII;Our influence in Hawaii has been threatened by a number of factors, including widespread popular support for the Monarchy against foreign investment and development. Luckily, a committee of local business interests has approached us with a proposal to annex the kingdom into our realm, requiring only material support in the overthrow of the Hawaiian queen. While these actions will surely seem uncouth on the world stage, they may be required to secure a proper hold over the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MONARCHYOVERTHROWN;The Committee of Public Safety, backed by local business interests and the $SPHEREMASTER$ navy, have overthrown the Hawaiian monarchy in a frightening coup d'etat. In the Kingdom's place now lies the Hawaiian Republic, a practical puppet state of the $SPHEREMASTER$. Rumor has is that the Committee of Public Safety is preparing plans for annexation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THELEPERWAR;With the overthrow of the Monarchy, the provisional government of our Republic has taken on the task of relocating all lepers within Hawaii to the isolated colony of Kalaupapa. However, anger over the forced relocation has led to a number of armed skirmishes between lepers and law enforcement, leading the Provisional Government to order the Hawaiian National Guard to remove the lepers to the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SECONDWILCOX;Following the establishment of the Republic, the old arch-rival of the plantation classes, Robert W. Wilcox, has taken to arms again. Rallying a coalition of conspirators, elements of the former Royal Guard, and native Hawaiian laborers recruited into a militia, Wilcox aims for a final desperate struggle to restore the traditional monarchy and depose the Republic. In Honolulu ambushes have begun against police and national guard elements, and the government has been forced to assemble a citizen's militia to put down the conspirators...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SECONDWILCOXSUCCESS;Lili'uokalani reigns again in Iolani. Wilcox's conspirators have pushed out the forces of the Republic, many of who now flee to America. As the restored Royal Guard now roots out the last elements of Yankee resistance, many fear the possible response of the United States to the rebellion's victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SECONDWILCOXDEFEATED;After a futile attack of Wilcox's conspirators without any preparations, their forces got destroyed and our country in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reassert_hawaii_RUS_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§! Several decades ago the Russian-American Company maintained a series of forts in the islands of Hawaii. Although we were pushed out, the Company has never truly abandoned claim to the resource-rich islands, and have at times approached the government in wishing to reclaim their control over the islands from the native monarchy. Hawaii could prove to be a valuable outpost for our empire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSFAILSTORETRIBUTE;Our expedition to Hawaii has ultimately not been successful. Including British and American officers, the Hawaiian Army was able to repel many of our landing parties, and those that landed were forced to retreat after several days of pitched battles and stalemates. If we wish to return to the islands, it will have to be with a large scale invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSRETRIBUTESUS;The forces of the Russian Tsar have invaded our kingdom. Despite our Royal Army's best efforts, the Russian marines have already landed on our shores. Already the Russian-American Company's flag flies over Honolulu. As the Russians present their treaty of annexation, our people fear for the future of our kingdom. However, not all hope is lost, for the most difficult part of Hawaii to conquer is the hinterland, and the people are ready to fight a war of attrition that may yet drive out the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSNOTFAILSTORETRIBUTE;Our expedition to Hawaii has been successful! The Russian-American Company flag now flies over Honolulu, and our colonial troops are rounding up the last elements of native resistance, who have taken flight to bases in the mountains and jungles. With the acquisition of the islands, Mother Russia has truly become a colonial power in her own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HAWAIIOVERTHROWN;The Committee of Public Safety, supported by the Honolulu Rifles and American naval troops, has overthrown the rule of the Hawaiian Kingdom in a swift coup d'état following several years of unrest in the former kingdom. Some analysts say the move was precipitated by Queen Lili'uokalani's desire for a new national constitution, restoring many of the rights of the monarchy taken away by foreign pressures. Others point to the expansion of American influence in the Pacific in recent years, and a desire of the local plantation class for the benefits of direct colonial annexation. Whatever the case may be, the Kingdom of Hawaii is no more, and a Provisional Government rules in its place, preparing for its eventual annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWANNEXATIONQUESTIONMARK;Our diplomats have sent a message to the United States Congress, asking for the annexation of the islands into the American colonial sphere. While many native elements despair at the news, many a bottle of champagne has been popped in the halls of power, as the planters await the creation of a new American territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USAMIGHTANNEXHAWAII;The Provisional Government of Hawaii has submitted a request to our Congress to be annexed as a territory of the United States. While the jingoists and expansionists are readily accepting of this offer, elements in both major parties have expressed dismay at the concept, primarily due to the illegal nature of the recent coup d'état. While the islands have proven extremely economic valuable, and their current government is eager for annexation, taking the offer at the present moment could prove a faux pas on the international stage…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANNEXATIONOFHAWAII;Hawaii has seen much unrest in the last decade, and although we initially turned down their annexation offer, the strategic and economic value of the islands has only grown since. With the Hawaiian government only recently having proposed annexation, us finally doing so will surely be welcomed by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANNEXATIONOFHAWAIIHAW;The Americans have landed on Hawaii and demanded we sign a treaty of annexation, citing our own recent proposal to be annexed. This treaty is a sort of belated agreement on the part of the US who now recognize our government as legitimate and therefore want to go ahead with the annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USAREFUSESANNEXATIONHAW;In a great surprise to our government, the United States has refused to accept our request for annexation. Citing the overthrow of the Hawaiian government as illegal, Minister to Hawaii James Blount has begin drafting a report into the circumstances of the coup. It will take much political and legal posturing to receive territory status now…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USAACCEPTSANNEXATIONHAW;The United States has accepted our offer of annexation! Now the flag of the Union flies over Honolulu, and the federal government has made plans for a grand naval base to be constructed at Pearl Harbor. The days of an independent Hawaii are over, and now begins the bright new future of the Territory of Hawaii!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNRESTINHAWAII;Following the overthrow of the monarchy, a great amount of civil unrest has broken out in the Hawaiian Islands. Domestic business fear that the unrest poses a great threat to our investments and interests in the region, and have pressured the federal government to do something about the matter. Some prominent leaders have even proposed the restoration of Queen Lili'uokalani (albeit under close American supervision) to put an end to the uncertainty on the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIREACTION;The sudden appearance of American naval ships off the coast of Hawaii has triggered a panic among the Provisional Government. Formerly hushed fears of an American invasion have grown much stronger, and many are convinced that the Federal Government intend to depose our rule and restore the native monarchy. As word reaches us that Japan and the United Kingdom might be supporting the United States position, we may have no chance but to relent and allow for an American investigation of the coup d'etat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIINVADED;American marines, supported by Japanese and British ships, have once again invaded Hawaii. But this time, they seek not to overthrow Lili'uokalani, but to restore her. The Provisional Government and the Honolulu Rifles have been pushed aside, and native government has been restored to the islands, under close American supervision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIBECOMESREPUBLIC;In acquiescing to American demands of a formal investigation, the Provisional Government of Hawaii has become the Republic of Hawaii. Creating a more institutionalized model of government alongside elections and formal political parties, the Republic noticeably has restricted sufferage to only the native Hawaiians and the Yankee settler class, much to the chagrin of the immigrant workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LILIUOKALANIDIES;Queen Liliuokalani has passed away today at the age of 79. As the people mourn the death of our longtime queen, who guided the nation through some of our darkest hours, it remains to be seen who shall now hold the throne in Honolulu. Three candidates are supported to succeed the late Queen: Theresa Owana Ka'ohelelani La'anui, David Kalakaua Kawananakoa, and Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KATALIANAOLEDIES;Our proud king Kalaniana'ole, the 'Prince of the People', has passed away after a relatively short reign. Two possible heirs have been put forward: Theresa Owana Ka'ohelelani, head of the house of La'anui, and David Kalakaua Kawananakoa, head of the House of Kawananakoa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAPLACEAFFAIR;Word has reached us today about the persecution of French Catholic missionaries in the remote Pacific islands of Hawaii. They have been imprisoned, beaten, and forbidden to spread the faith to the inhabitants of the islands. To the church, this cannot stand. The Foreign Ministry has proposed a naval expedition to these islands, to force the Hawaiian king to stand down and release the French prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAPLACEAFFAIRHAW;A French gunboat has sailed to our shores today, commanded by Captain Laplace. He has sent the message that we are to immediately end our policies of persecution towards the Catholic missionaries, or face bombardment and war with France. Submitting to French demands would anger the Protestant churches, but would likely be preferable to risking a war with a great power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAPLACEAFFAIRHAWACCEPTED;Hawaii has accepted our demands: they have released the prisoners and allowed the Hawaiian Catholic Church to operate. Through this we have gained key influence in the Pacific and Captain Laplace sails back to French shores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAPLACEAFFAIRHAWREFUSED;The Hawaiian king has refused to accept our rightful demands. Outrage has struck at the injustice, and local newspapers have published gruesome imagery of the conditions the preachers have been held in. Although an outright invasion has been called for, it may be considered overly jingoistic by the other powers to annex the islands entirely. This, however, might be the easiest chance to establish a foothold in the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SARAWAKREBELLION;Following the discovery of antimony ore in the Kuching region, where this rebellion is centered, Pangeran Indera Mahkota (a representative of our great Sultanate) began to develop the territory between 1824 and 1830. When antimony production increased, we demanded higher taxes from Sarawak to maximize profit, and this has led to civil unrest and chaos. In 1839 we appointed the uncle of the sultan, Pengiran Muda Hashim, to restore order in the region. However the people of Kuching have found a newfound sympathy with the rebellion, and now go to arms to stop him… May God have mercy on the Sultanate of Brunei.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRIISHSUPPORTREBELLIONQUESTION;The Sultanate of Brunei is in conflict with the Sarawak Rebellion.

HAWPROPOSESBUYSOLOMON;The Kingdom of Hawaii has proposed a purchase of the remote Solomon Islands following the supposed annexation of a small atoll to their kingdom several decades prior.

With the Belgians threatening to expand their claims over the economically valuable area, we should use our position to push Belgian influence out of Lado and the Sudd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LADOENCLAVEWILLBEBRITISH;Britain has demanded that we give up claims to the Lado Enclave, claiming an infringement of their colonial territorial sovereignty. While this is plainly ridiculous, the large stretch of African jungle might not be worth the cost of alienating and potentially going to war against the British Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ALASKABOUNDARY;Following the new administration of Alaska and the discovery of gold in the region, a boundary dispute has emerged over the exact borders of the Alaskan Panhandle, arising from an unclear treaty with Russians many decades ago. Tensions are high - we can try to compromise, concede to foreign claims, or take the matter directly to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALASKABOUNDARYGIVENUS;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has graciously accepted our claims in the disputed region of Alaska. While this could have been a significant dispute, we can rest easy knowing that our territorial integrity is respected by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALASKABOUNDARYWAR;The latest attempt at mediating the long-standing Alaskan Boundary dispute between the British Dominion of Canada and our administration of Alaska has failed. Since Britain refuses to back down, if we do not abandon our claims to the disputed regions in Alaska, we may have to face the might of their armies. While $FROMCOUNTRY$ is indeed a mighty foe, and the territory in question is quite small, backing down could be a sign of weakness and a humiliation to our citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALASKABOUNDARYCOMPROMISE;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us on resolving the question of the disputed border between the Stickeen and Alaska. The creation of a arbitration committee comprising American, Canadian, and British interests is the logical step forward. Of course, we could simply refuse, but risk the British pressing their claims by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALASKABOUNDARYWARFAILEDCOMPROMISE;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ministry has refused to even indulge the idea of a mediated settlement. Their stubbornness leaves the issue in a continued limbo - we could concede and keep the status quo, at the loss of our claims, or take the issue to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

THEPIGWAREVENTFORTHEBRITISH;A small military skirmish has broken out in the San Juan Islands of the Salish Sea. An American farmer has shot a British-owned pig that had been rooting in his garden, and the situation has suddenly escalated to a tense military standoff between our two great powers. Although this situation has started from such minor circumstances, local colonial interests steadfastly demand British action in the islands, and tensions are high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEPIGWARGIVENISLANDS;Following a local military conflict over the shooting of a British pig, the United Kingdom has agreed to cede the San Juan Islands to our Washington Territory, not wishing to start a war over the tiny isles. The humorous incident has become a folk tale in the region, and our sphere of control has been slightly expanded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEPIGPROVOKESWAR;The British have approved military action over the evolving crisis in the San Juan Islands, which reportedly began over the shooting of a British pig. Although we can back down to avoid an open conflict, it would involve the cession of the San Juans to British control, and would be seen as a submissive position on the world stage. On the other hand, is a single pig worth a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEPIGWARCALMSDOWN;The so-called “Pig War”, a military standoff between British and American forces on the disputed San Juan Islands, has thankfully ended without casualties (unless one counts the pig.) While we await a proper settlement of the disputed islands, both governments can breathe easy that a war between the two nations is not on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARBITRATETHEPIGS;The joint Anglo-American occupation of the San Juans has mostly continued without incident since the Pig War. However, the territory's ownership has not yet been settled on. By deferring to a neutral third party, in the form of the German Empire, we can officially resolve this dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;
WASHINGTONTREATYDONE;As a result of arbitration by the German Kaiser, we have been granted full control over the San Juan Islands, following a period of joint military occupation by Anglo-American forces. With our undisputed ownership of the islands, the days of American expansion in the Pacific Northwest have officially come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GERMANARBITRATION;The United Kingdom seeks our impartial opinion on who shall receive the San Juans Islands, an archipelago off the Pacific Northwestern coast claimed by both the British and Americans. The conflict over this dispute has inflamed by the shooting of an Irishman's pig by an American settler, who sought American military protection after the incident. Now the two countries are at it again over the not-yet-finalized final border between the US and Canada. But now we have the power to decide which of these countries will have these islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Anyone with a conviction that slavery must be gone from Cuba, whipped until near death. \n\nSpanish authorities, zealous in their crackdown on potential participants in a slave rebellion, whether it be actually be planned or not, have begun a campaign of terror against the Cuban population. Reports have been received that civilians are being rounded up by Spanish soldiers and then tied to a ladder, where they would be helpless against the oncoming flurry of lashings. \n\nNon-Cubans have also been implicated in the alleged conspiracy.

WHALERSRIOTHAWAII;Following the killing of a drunk and rowdy sailor in a Honolulu jail, a mass of drunken and frenzied whalers and assorted seamen took to riot in Honolulu.

Alas, he eventually contacted leprosy through his work, and has passed away following a struggle with the disease.

BOMBEDMAUNALOA;Lieutenant Colonel Patton's plan, against seemingly all possible odds, has worked. Hilo has been saved, as just days after the bombing the flow has apparently reversed direction completely. 7000 pounds of TNT was dropped on the volcano over six days, and the event has become something of a local folklore, with reports of locals attempting to recovering unexploded ordinance as keepsakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SEXUALWISSENSCHAFT;A highly unique medical research institute has been founded in Berlin by Magnus Hirschfeld. Dubbed the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft ('Institute of Sexology'), the Institute has become a self-described safe haven for homosexuals and transsexuals in Germany. The Institute has become an outspoken advocate for the rights of homosexuals, supporting a radical social program including advocating for the public acceptance of homosexuality, medical care for the sex reassignment of transsexual patients, and the existence of a 'third gender' outside of male and female. Frequently subject to vandalism by right wing elements, the Institute has become a flashpoint in the evolving social environment of this new Berlin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAMNWHYDIDTHEYHAVETODOTHAT;A far right student organization associated with the NSDAP has attacked and demolished the controversial Institute of Sexology, known for their steadfast defense of the rights of homosexuals and transsexuals. A book burning of the Institute's library has taken place in the Opernplatz, and many of the Institute's faculty and patients have been taken to prisons and labor camps, or disappeared entirely. As the smoke rises over Berlin, one cannot help but feel another flame has been snuffed out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GERDAWEGENER;An illustrator named Gerda Wegener has become something of a celebrity within art circles in Denmark. Known for her colorful Art Nouveau paintings, usually depicting tender scenes between women, Wegener has adopted an extravagant bohemian lifestyle alongside her husband.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LILIELBE;The famed portrait artist Gerda Wegener has revealed that her longtime female model has been her own supposed husband, Mr. Wegener. Wegener has put forward a petition with our government requesting a change of name to Lili Ilse Elvenes, and a change of sex to female. While transvestites are nothing new to Copenhagen, changing the legal sex of a citizen has never been performed in any European state, or perhaps any state whatsoever. \nLili and her wife have great cultural influence within the art world, and the issue has become a sensation in German and Danish newspapers. We could allow the change, but this would spark great unrest due to the technical allowance of a homosexual marriage. Alternatively, we could annul the marriage through an act of the government, and allow the marriage to go through following this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OKINAWANMIGRATION;An Okinawan activist and businessman named Kyuzo Toyama has organized large scale immigration from Okinawa to our islands. With the islands experiencing economic woes and recession, many immigrants have come with Kyuzo to work in the plantation industry. However, this migration has not been well-received by the rest of the local Japanese community, who have degraded and insulted many an Okinawan migrant, viewing them as backwards and clueless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPANESEMIGRATION;A group of Japanese immigrants have come to our kingdom, seeking employment in the sugarcane plantations. Known as the 'Gannenmono', the 'first-year-people', they have become the foundation of the Japanese community in our islands, and bring with them their cuisine and culture to the fabric of Hawai'i;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SURFCOMING;Three of our young princes, on their educational journey abroad, have introduced our traditional sport of surf-riding to the United States. Traditionally only enjoyed by Polynesians, the practice of lying or standing upright on boards amidst the ocean waves has appealed to some British and American tourists. They have come to a stretch on O'ahu known as Waikiki to enjoy the ancient past-time alongside native Hawaiian surfers. Some have even returned to start surfing clubs along the coast of California.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAVEICE;Japanese immigrants to our islands have brought a new dish, known as Shave Ice. Inspired by the traditional desert of Kakigori, shave ice has become a favorite among plantation workers of all nationalities. Made simply by shaving a block of ice into fine shards and then flavoring it with sweet syrups, the desert has become a Hawaiian culinary symbol for those hot humid days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANIOLO;Inspired by the Vaquero traditions of Mexico, a unique culture of cattle farming has arisen on the Big Island of Hawaii. Calling themselves Paniolo, these horseback riders having taken to many cowboy and vaquero traditions from the Americas, and even spread the Mexican-American sporting event of Rodeo to the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ROYALELECTIONHAW;Following the untimely death of King Lunalilo, a contentious royal election has begun. The three primary candidates are Prince David Kalakaua, Queen Consort Emma Kaleleokalani, and Lady Bernice Pauahi Bishop, all once classmates at the Royal School. Prince Kalakaua is a nativist and intensely supports the economic and political sovereignty of Hawaii;  Queen Emma is outspokenly Pro-British, and Bernice Bishop prefers a strong relationship with the Americans. Out of all the candidates, Emma and Kalakaua enjoy the most support, and conflicts are high going into the royal election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HONOLULUCOURTHOUSERIOT;Following the election of King Kalakaua to the throne of Hawaii, the Emmaites (supports of Queen Emma’s candidacy) have rioted during the official counting of votes for the Royal Election. Attacking Kalakaua’s supporters and vandalizing the Honolulu Courthouse, the riot was only put down by the combined forces of British and American marines, alongside local Hawaiian police and militia. Thirteen legislators were severely injuried, with one, Representative Lonoaea, dying from his injuries. Although Emma herself condemned the violence, the Emmaites stay militant and continue demanding her installation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QUEENEMMADED;Her majesty Queen Kaleleokalani, better known as “Queen Emma”, has passed away. A strong supporter of British economic investment in Hawaii, in her death the British have proposed the creation of an official protectorate encompassing the Hawaiian Islands. While King Kalakaua assumes the throne, it is unclear in what capacity he shall govern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIANNEXEDBRIISH;The death of the pro-British Queen Emma Kaleleokalani has created a power vacuum in the island kingdom of Hawaii. Several of our foreign ministers have proposed the use of this opportunity to create a British protectorate over the islands, but this may incur some minor grumbling from the other powers with interests in the Pacific region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QUEENPAUAHIDED;Our Queen Pauhai has passed away today in Honolulu. Beloved by the common people for her philanthropy and the capitalists for her pro-American stance, her death and the resulting of succession of King Kalakaua has put our kingdom into an awkward position. It is very likely that the Americans will expand their political influence in the islands to prevent losing their economic expansion cultivated under the late Queen. These may be dark days for Hawaii…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESTORATIONHAWMONARCHY;After the USA's pacification of our territory, our Monarchy has been restored and the Red, white and blue flies again over the 'Iolani Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
haw_constitution_1893_title;Lili'uokalani's Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
haw_constitution_1893_desc;With our freedom secured, Queen Lili'uokalani has proposed a new constitution for our Kingdom rolling back the Bayonet Constitution and restoring the rights of the 1864 Constitution. Granting women's suffrage, minority rights, greater executive power to the Monarchy, and curtailing the authority of the Big Five, the constitution will be seen as a restoration of Hawaiian sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
prospect_venezuela_title;Prospect for Natural Resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;
prospect_venezuela_desc;With our economic destitution following the war of independence against Spain, instability and civil wars, the lack of foreign investment and the inability to acquire loans, we were long unable to search for rumored deposits of valuable veins of iron and coal. Now that we've gained significant standing on the international stage and have sufficient capital to invest in prospecting, perhaps it is time to begin the exploration and exploitation of our underdeveloped resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1880ZAGREBEARTHQUAKE;A earthquake struck the Croatian city of Zagreb today at 7:33 AM. The tremor and its small aftershocks have wrought destruction on many local buildings. Most tragically, the Zagreb Cathedral was severely damaged, with its nave suffering collapse and the tower destroyed beyond repair. The human toll, on the other hand, is miraculously small--only one person has been confirmed dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;
LORETANINSURRECTION;President Nicolás de Perola's betrayal of his promise to implement a federal system in Peru has sparked a rebellion in Loreto. The general Ricardo Seminario y Aramburú, amassing a militia for the cause, has declared the Federal State of Loreto as an integral part of Peru. Locals are showing strong support for this effort due to the government's neglect of the Department, despite its economic importance due to the rubber boom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAMDIAMASSACRE;500-800 Cretan Christians of the city of Candia have been massacred by our forces. This outbreak of violence was motivated by Western powers' recent condemnation concerning our treatment of Christians on Crete. Muslim irregulars burnt part of the city and, over the course of four hours, slaughtered Christian civilians by the hundreds. \n\nThe massacre will certainly cause a swift, decisive and united international response, incurring upon us the wrath of the Western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIGWARUSAWON;The so-called "Pig War" against the British has ended, in our favor. We could take this opportunity to claim the whole of Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands, both known for their wealth in timber and minerals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIGWARBRIISHWON;The so-called 'Pig War' against the Americans has ended, in our favor. We should take this opportunity to expand our control to the whole of the Puget Sound region, valuable for fishing and agricultural development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1886WINTERTITLE;The Winter of 1886–1887;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1886WINTER;Starvation and hypothermia are wracking the residents and livestock of North America in this particularly lethal winter. When snow came earlier than expected and fell in unprecented amounts, cow pastures were destroyed and cattle ended up starving to death. Human inhabitants, meanwhile, are reported to have been frequently dying to hypothermia and frostbite. The weather has spread across the entire continent--even leading to snowfall in San Francisco. All we can ask: when will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1874GUATEMALAEARTHQUAKE;A severe earthquake hit Guatemala today at around 9:30 PM. With its epicenter around the village of Patzicía, the tremor damaged communities in Amatitlán, Escuintla, Chimaltenango and Antigua Guatemala. \n\nIt also completely destroyed the village of Parramos, whose inhabitants had no choice but to relocate their homesteads 3-and-a-half kilometers south of the original settlement. Armed bandits also contributed to the villagers' flight by robbing them of the few remaining possessions they had after their homes' destruction. Fortunately, authorities later arrested and summarily executed the bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1906ESMERALDASEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake has struck the province of Esmeraldas. The tremor's magnitude has caused serious damage to local communities as well as generating tsunamis reaching Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Hawaii, and even Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1868ECUADOREARTHQUAKE;An earthquake rocked Ecuador and southern Colombia yesterday, causing severe damage. The seismic center formed near El Ángel, Carchi province, and aftershocks persisted for 24 hours. Seismic activity was reported again today near Ibarra, Imbabura province. \n\nEl Ángel was described as "ruined" by the destruction. Ibarra and Otavalo, in Imbabura, were utterly destroyed, with 6,000 casualties total reported between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1875CUCUTAEARTHQUAKE;The northeastern Andes have been rocked by a large tremor that traversed from Cúcuta all the way to both Bogotá in the west and Caracas to the east. Property damage and fatalities are still being assessed, and deaths have been estimated to be over 1,000. 900 have been reported dead in Cúcuta alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833SUMATRAEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake has been reported today in Benkoelen and Padang, Sumatra, the magnitude of which has been so severe as to generate tsunamis touchdowning in several directions. Tsunamis resulting from the earthquake were reported in Ceylon, the Maldives, and even the Seychelles--all of which have also racked up notable damage to property and human lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1843GUADELOUPEEARTHQUAKE;The Caribbean island of Guadaloupe experienced a rare, extremely devastating earthquake today, wreaking havoc and leaving thousands of casualties in its wake. The town of Pointe-à-Pitre reports the destruction of 8-900 of the 1,222 houses in the area that existed before the earthquake struck. Estimates of deaths range in the thousands, with some tens reported in nearby islands also affected, including Antigua and Montserrat. Aftershocks, meanwhile, traveled up the Atlantic and could even be felt in New York City.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1904KRESNAEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake wreaked havoc on southwestern Bulgaria today, with an epicenter in the village of Kresna. Damage to the houses within Kresna was manageable, due to their sturdy wooden frames. However, the villages of Dzhumaya, Bansko, and Razlog were affected by severe damage, and Simitli and Krupnik were totally destroyed. More than 200 people perished in the first two shocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1922VALLENAREARTHQUAKE;A powerful tremor occurred today along the Chilean-Argentine border, within the village of Vallenar. A line of extensive damage extending from Copiapó to Coquimbo was reported, with around 1,000 confirmed dead. Meanwhile, resulting tsunamis have killed several hundreds in Coquimbo.;;;;;;;;;;;;
1842CAPHAITIEARTHQUAKE;Hispaniola has suffered a huge earthquake with an epicenter around the city of Cap-Haitien. The quake struck at around 5:00 PM and was felt across the entire country and other islands in the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Puerto Rico. It has tragically devastated the North Cape region of Haiti, resulting in around 5,000 casualties when counting fatalities from resulting tsunamis. The tsunamis after the shocks particularly devastated Port-de-Paix, where 200-300 died, and completely destroyed Môle-Saint-Nicolas--leaving almost no one in the town alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1927JERICHOEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake with an epicenter in Jericho has left devastation across Palestine. Though the quake lasted around 5 seconds, damage was immediately felt as far away as Jerusalem, as well as in Nablus, Lydda, Ramle, and Tiberias. 300 buildings in Nablus suffered destruction, and both the city's Victory Mosque and Great Mosque were damaged. In Jerusalem--most tragically--the earthquakes caused the domes of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to collapse. Damage was also wrought on the Old City's Jewish quarter. In Transjordan, damages were reported in the city of al-Salt. The earthquake left an estimated 287 dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1855WAIRARAPAEARTHQUAKE;New Zealand experienced an incredibly powerful earthquake today, perhaps the most powerful since the start of European contact. The epicenter was located within the Wairarapa, a province in the south of North Island. Damage to settlements in the epicenter's vicinity was miraculously avoided due to structures being rebuilt to withstand future earthquakes. However, the jetties of Wellington Harbor were rendered unusable due to the quake uplifting much of its land. Severe landslides were also reported. Despite all this, less than 10 fatalities have been confirmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1895LJUBLJANAEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake rattled the Slovene city of Ljubljana today, destroying thousands of homes in its wake. Its epicenter was identified in Jance, a town east of Ljubljana's center. More than 100 aftershocks were felt in an area of 385,000 square kilometers--reaching as far as Florence, Vienna, Assisi, and Spalato. Casualties, however, remain few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1867VIRGINSEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake has devastated the West Indies today as two shocks were felt from the island of Saint Thomas. Two days after the touchdown of the deadly San Narciso Hurricane in the region, shaking was felt across the town of Frederiksted and to a lesser extent throughout other islands in the Greater Antilles. Casualties have been reported within the 50s range, including from resulting tsunamis. One such wave, reported to have been like a "straight white wall, 15 to 23 feet," left the British mail vessal La Plata swept away and its passengers and crew all killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1923KANTOEARTHQUAKE;Citizens of Tokyo and its surrounding cities are in shock. At 11:58 AM, a powerful earthquake erupted and raged on for several minutes, destroying property and life as the tremor was felt in Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba, Shizuoka, and Kanagawa. Entire neighborhoods are left in rubble, with many houses also engulfed by stove fires started while residents were cooking lunch before the quake. According to the captain of the SS Dongola, which docked in Yokohama before disaster struck, within minutes whole buildings evaporated into clouds of dust. The authorities could not contain the ensuing fires due to water mains bursting from damage. An estimated 120,000+ have died. The suffering of the Japanese people in this catastrophe has also led, horrifyingly, to racial scapegoating. As residents emerged from their ruins, ethnic Koreans were framed for anarchy and crime in the quake's aftermath. With police giving explicit support, lynch mobs have descended on Korean laborers and Japanese left-wing activists to vent misguided frustrations, leading to thousands of reported murders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FREIRESEXPEDITION;News has reached us that liberal leader Ramón Saturnino Andrés Freire y Serrano landed in Chiloé Island at the head of a military expedition consisting of two ships. While the sailors are Chilean, the ships and weapons were supplied to him in Lima by the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, plotting to have Freire overthrow our government. However, the crew of one of the ships turned against him shortly after having captured the island and handed him over to our government. Freire had lead the Liberals in the Civil War of 1830-31 and was subsequently exiled, but evidently this hasn't prevented him from causing more instability. How shall we deal with him this time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1851COPIAPOEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake has struck the city of Copiapó, with shocks reaching from Atacama and Coquimbo to Santiago de Chile. The most notable damages were across this entire stretch of land, with local newspapers publishing stories about the destruction of homes, churches, and bridge archways. Thankfully, the damage came to pass, and no tsunamis were reported afterward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1851COPIAPOOPT;May we recover fully from this tremor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1859COPIAPOEARTHQUAKE;Yet anopther earthquake has struck the city of Copiapó, leading to notable damages within the city and its outlying areas. Although no casualties have been reported, the shocks have left around 115 homes destroyed and another 224 declared uninhabitable. Reports also surfaced of damage to the Copiapó-Caldera railway. Copiapó as of now remains shrouded in a veil of dust that leaves the city in total darkness, a reminder of the disaster even as its wrath has come to pass. The earthquake's shocks were perceived from Atacama and Coquimbo down to Santiago de Chile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1859COPIAPOOPT;¡Dios tenga piedad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1893PUNTAARENASEARTHQUAKE;Punta Arenas, a settlement in the far southern tip of Chile, suffered an destructive earthquake today. Due to the town having been founded only 48 years prior, builders did not reinforce its most recent structures to withstand such a shock. As a result, 94% of all buildings in the town suffered major damage, while 64% collapsed entirely. 16 people are reported dead, and 26 are reported missing. 659 were injured, and 4,576 have lost their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1893PUNTAARENASOPT;Does Mother Nature ever relent?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1918COPIAPOEARTHQUAKE;Copiapó yet again fell victim to the terror of another earthquake. With a VII rating on the Mercalli scale--a "very strong" category--buildings have again collapsed into rubble due to poor retrofitting. Yet, as is fitting for the precedent set by the two previous minimally fatal earthquakes, only eight people have been confirmed dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1918COPIAPOOPT;That town is cursed. No one should live there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1928TALCAEARTHQUAKE;An earthquake has wrought destruction upon the Maule region of Chile, leading to fatalities and building collapses from Talca to Concepción. Rated XI on the Mercalli Scale, the tremor lasted approximately a minute and 45 seconds. 108 residents of Talca have been confirmed dead, as well as 67 in Constitución, and another 67 in other surrounding villagers. The quake also caused the Barahona Dam, on the Cachapoal River, to collapse, crushing 57 minors to their deaths. 279 people in total have been killed, while another 1,083 were wounded. Over 120,000 are now left homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1928TALCAOPT;Why Chile? Why us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1902SAMAXIEARTHQUAKE;The town of Shamakhi, in Azerbaijan, has fallen victim to an earthquake. The area has historically been a zone of high seismic activity, though this particular earthquake has wrought catastrophic damage to the town that newspapers have compared to Judgment Day. An estimated 2,000 residents were killed. Thousands were injured. Up to 20,000 were rendered homeless. Houses, markets, mosques, madrasahs, bathhouses--all wiped off the map.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1902SAMAXIOPT;Have mercy, Lord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1838VRANCEAEARTHQUAKE;A seism has rocked the Balkans after shocks erupted from Vrancea County, Moldavia. The earthquake occurred at 8:00 PM and was felt most in Bucharest, though shocks permeated all the way to Sevastopol and even Constantinople itself. Notable in addition to 74 confirmed deaths is the destruction of hundreds of churches within Wallachia and Moldavia. Powerful landslides also occurred in Moldavia, one of which even closed Ghilcos Brook, a tributary of the Bicaz River--sealing the water for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1928PLODVIVEARTHQUAKE;The residents of central Bulgaria watched helplessly over the past four days as two tremors annihilated their homes and properties. With one quake centered in Chirpan and another in Plovdiv, the latter occurring four days later, 70,000 buildings total suffered collapse and an estimated 127 people have died. The quakes also were felt in nearby Greece and caused significant damage there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SIAMESEREVOLUTION1932;Unrest against Siam's absolute monarchy has culminated in the launching of an official revolution. King Rama VI has done little to resolve his nation's increasing debt and instead has fostered corruption, leading to his court and military to turn against him. These military officers and soldiers formed the Khana Ratsadon, or "People's Party," to force the king to relinquish absolute power. They demand a constitutional monarchy and a national assembly, creating a European-style government. Is it time for the old order to die out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AMERICANCOLONIZATIONSOCIETY;'Shame upon the guilty wretches that dare propose, and all that countenance such a proposition. We live here -- have lived here -- have a right to live here, and mean to live here.'\n\nWhile President Lincoln has long been a supporter of the American Colonization Society and its efforts to resettle freed blacks in Liberia, his position has become increasingly unacceptable as black people and abolitionists see it as a method of depriving African-Americans of their freedom and perpetuating slavery. Now, Frederick Douglass, a famous escaped slave, abolitionist, social reformer, orator, writer and statesman has approached Lincoln and conferred with him on the matter of settling free blacks overseas -- a proposition that Douglass could not more vehemently oppose. Whether his arguments convinced Lincoln will remain to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

establish_linconia_desc;The possibility of founding a black colony in the Chiriquí district of Panama, an outlying part of Colombia, has been proposed in Congress. The area has evidence of very rich coal mines and among the finest harbors in the world. There are, however, several issues: Colombia is a very unstable country that has seen many civil wars. Additionally, the region is disputed with Costa Rica. Both may object to us purchasing the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHIRIQUIPROJECT;The United States of America have proposed purchasing the Chiriquí District of Colombia as a colony to settle free blacks in. However, giving them this land would be seen as selling out to the Americans. Though we could very well use the money -- 100k to be exact -- the damage to our international standing and the support of our government by the people may be greater.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHIRIQUIACCEPTED;Colombia's government has accepted the offer of purchasing Chiriquí, due to their national debt and dire need of funds. The dream of a colony in Panama has become a reality, and already free blacks have signed up to emigrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHIRIQUIREFUSED;Colombia's government has turned down the offer of purchasing Chiriquí, citing their national integrity being at stake. The dream of a colony in Panama has evaporated as quickly as it materialized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1802ROYALCERTIFICATE;El Comercio, a Lima newspaper, published the text of the Royal Certificate of 1802.

COTOWAR;The Costa Rican colonel Héctor Zúñiga's army crossed into the Panamanian town of Pueblo Nuevo de Coto, occupying it. The colonel did so as a power play to claim the disputed border territories between us and Costa Rica.

Zúñiga's action is clearly an act of war. The Costa Ricans must be repelled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COTOWARCOS;News has reached us that Colonel Héctor Zúñiga has decided to cross into the Panamanian town of Pueblo Nuevo de Coto, occupying it. The colonel did so as a power play to claim the disputed border territories between us and Panama.

KASHMIRSAPPHIRE;A exceptionally pure species of sapphire became known to Indian authorities today as one such gem was brought to Simla. The gem--deep blue hue and a sunny glazed luster to match--allegedly was sold to the trader by a huntsman in the Zaskar Mountain Range, who used it to light his pipe instead of his usual quartz stone he'd find on the ground. A notable British jeweller bought the gem for dirt cheap, and soon enough word spread to the Maharajah of Kashmir, who ordered his soldiers to find the sapphire mines and occupy them. Kashmir very well may be home to some of the finest sapphires in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KASHMIRSAPPHIRESGONE;The Maharajah of Kashmir, noting the drop in revenue from the Kashmir sapphire industry, has sent geologist T.D. LaTouche to survey the Zaskar Mountains' sapphire mines for their viability. LaTouche concluded that most of the mines were exhausted of their sapphire veins, except for the valley floor. Mining continues there, but the sales from their gems will never be as profitable as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
algiers_treaty_port_title;The Algiers Treaty Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;
algiers_treaty_port_desc;Founded as a colony by the Phoenecians to be a commercial outpost, the port of Algiers is today the most important North African seaport providing trade between the rest of Algeria and the Mediterranean. In the 14th century, the port was conquered by the Spanish who were later expelled in 1529, and was instead brought under the control of the Ottomans. During the next 300 years the port would be a major port for the Barbary pirates. If we decide to take the port, we could use it as a staging ground for further expeditions into Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
oran_treaty_port_title;The Oran Treaty Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;
oran_treaty_port_desc;Oran was founded at the beginning of the 10th century by Andalusian merchants as a base for trade with the North African hinterland. Like the port of Algiers, it eventually ended up with the Spanish, who later would lose it to the Ottoman Turks. In 1732 Spain would retake the port, only for it to be abandoned and returned to the Turks following a devastating earthquake in 1790, who would settle a Jewish community in the port-city. Oran is strategically valuable as both the second-largest city of Algeria and the key to the Algerian West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
multi_effect_evaporator;Multiple-effect Evaporator;;;;;;;;;;;;
multi_effect_evaporator_desc;A multi-effect evaporator is an apparatus consisting of multiple evaporator bodies linked together in such a way as to allow steam produced by boiling the water in one evaporator to boil water in successive evaporators, with only the first evaporator in the sequence requiring an external heating source. The multi-effect evaporator was invented and patented by Louisiana Creole inventor Norbert Rillieux to increase the efficiency of refining sugar from cane juice. In the early 19th century, the primary method of refining cane sugar from juice was the "sugar train" or "Jamaica train," a typically slave-operated process which relied on pouring hot cane juice reduction through a succession of bowls to increase its evaporation rate. Rillieux's multi-effect evaporator displayed vast improvements in safety, efficiency, and cost over contemporary methods, and to this day remains a staple in industrial-scale evaporation for refining products ranging from cane and beet sugar to sea salt and wood pulp.;;;;;;;;;;;;
sugarcane_harvester;Sugarcane Harvester;;;;;;;;;;;;
sugarcane_harvester_desc;A sugarcane harvester is a large piece of agricultural machinery used to harvest and partially process sugarcane. It remains similar in function and design to the combine harvester. Essentially a storage vessel on a truck with a mechanical extension, the machine cuts the stalks at the base, strips the leaves off, and then cuts the cane into segments. These are then deposited into either the on-board container, or a separate vehicle traveling alongside.;;;;;;;;;;;;
rail_skidders;Rail Skidders;;;;;;;;;;;;
rail_skidders_desc;A skidder is any type of heavy vehicle used in a logging operation for pulling cut trees out of a forest in a process called "skidding", in which the logs are transported from the cutting site to a landing. With logging operations moving further into forests and further away from sawmills, the process of skidding has become more cumbersome. However, where forest railways are installed, new rail-based skidders have been introduced that can skid logs to the railroad for loading. They are often high-performance and can skid logs from up to four directions at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EASTLANDDISASTER;Constructed in 1902-1903, SS Eastland was a passenger ship of 1,961 tonnes. The ship has had previous incidents of listing, but never in the magnitude of this recent event. On the 24th of July, 1915, Eastland would set out on a voyage following the retrofitting of additional and newer lifeboats in accordance with the new Seamen’s Act, which was a consequential measure of the Titanic disaster. This additional weight may have made the Eastland more top-heavy. At 7:10AM on the 24th of July, the ship had been filled to her passenger capacity, and started to list to the port side. By 7:28AM the Eastland was listing so heavily that she rolled over completely on her port side, coming to rest on the bottom of the river. Barely half the ship was now underwater, and with most of the passengers already below deck due to the cold and damp weather, the results were that many people got trapped underneath the ship and waterline. A total of 844 passengers, of which 220 were Czech immigrants, as well as 4 crew members have been killed in the accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_pata_gonia_chl_desc;Ever since we and the Argentine states gained independence from the Spanish, diplomatic relations have been steadily getting more heated over the disputed borders of overlapping territories in Patagonia. We have a valid claim to all of Patagonia, which traces back to the 16th century during which Pedro de Valdivia obtained rights from the Spanish crown to establish a captaincy reaching to the southern tip of Patagonia, at the Strait of Magellan. Valdivia subsequently founded multiple cities throughout southern Chile, intending to reach the Strait of Magellan. If we alleviate concerns with the US regarding shipping rights through the strait, we could secure their neutrality on the matter, which would mean we may press our claim without fear of intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With this map in hand, proudly showing Chile's name spread from the Pais de los Pampas and the Provincia de Cuyo to Santiago de Chile, we can perfectly justify claiming these righfully Chilean lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KRAKOWGETSATREAT;A Russian spy by the name of Behrens-Pawlowski has been murdered by agents of the Polish People's Association, a militant group advocating for the restoration of Poland, in defiance of the three great powers jointly controlling our country -- Russia, Prussia and Austria. Since the establishment of the Free City of Krakow in 1815, thousands of Poles from the surrounding absolute monarchies have migrated to the free city to escape the foreign persecution and live in a Polish state. In particular, many agitants for independence of Poles from Russia, Prussia and Austria have come to Krakow to escape arrest and plot eventual rebellions. Now, in retaliation for the murder, the three great powers have demanded we expel the migrants -- and allow foreign troops to enter our territory to enforce the policy. Refusal to cooperate will likely result in a joint Russian-Prussian-Austrian invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

REDBARON;Baron Manfred von Richthofen, or the Red Baron- referring to the red painted Albatros D.III and the current Fokker Dr.I triplane he flies, has recently earned a fierce reputation as a top fighter ace. Richthofen is the commander of Jasta 11, also called the “Flying Circus”, yet he did not start as a soldier of the skies. Richthofen started his career as a cavalry reconnaissance officer, but due to the advent of trench warfare, his regiment was dismounted. Eventually, he joined Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches as an observer on reconnaissance missions, and was later transferred to another flying unit where he was taught to fly solo. He has scored almost 80 kills so far, more than any other pilot to date, making him a feared adversary for our foes, as well as a legendary hero to the German people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

austria_metternich;Klemens von Metternich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
austria_metternich_desc;Klemens von Metternich, the conductor of the Concert of Europe, is the mastermind behind Austrian diplomacy. In the Congress of Vienna of 1815, he shaped the Europe to what it is today. A staunch proponent of absolutism, he works toward the suppressing of liberalism and the maintaining of the ancien regime, making him unpopular among the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METTERNICHOUT;Prime Minister Klemens von Metternich's iron fist finally has pushed Viennese liberals to the breaking point. As students and working class subjects in the city continuously have issued petitions for government reform and taken to the streets, the government has responded with troops to suppress them. But all the unrest came to a head today, when a group of Viennese students called for Metternich's resignation under the threat of more rioting. The students have even suggested a deal: They will form a temporary 'Academic Legion' to help suppress the Hungarian Revolt under the condition that Metternich resigns. \n\n§RWarning: You have to merge the brigades that are generated by this event§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METTERNICHDED;The Concert of Europe's mastermind, Klemens von Metternich, has died today. Metternich singlehandedly negotiated a détante with Napoleonic France during its rise to dominance over Europe, alowing Austria to buy time and join the allies in the War of the Sixth Coalition. After Napoleon's overthrow, he served as a chancellor of Austria, known for suppressing nationalist revolts and consolidating Austria's rule over Central Europe by resisting Ottoman and Russian expansion. Though his chancellorship floundered during the Revolutions of 1848, he remained vital to the empire and Emperor Franz Joseph. Though his absolutist views were massively unpopular among liberals, Metternich will be missed. His death strikes a huge blow to conservatism in Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SYLLABUSOFERRORS;The Holy See, under Pope Pius IX, has published a new document of errors, or heresies, condemned by the Catholic Church. This "Syllabus of Errors" proclaims a total of eighty heresies, further expanding on the Church's positions on various topics. Those topics, however, extend far more into the political than what the Church has authority on. For example, it states it is heretical to state that Protestantism, or any other religion besides Catholicism, can provide salvation. It also issues a blanket condemnation of socialism, communism, Bible societies, Christian liberalism, and secularism. In Protestants' eyes, this has come as a shock and has been severely panned by them--since they assert no one group has whole authority over God's message. Catholics are also heavily divided, with many seeing it as an attack on personal values outside the Church's authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The local workers in the indigo factories are refusing to work and are taking up arms against the planters and factory owners. There are disturbing reports of planters being tried by these peasants, and subsequently executed. Even still, if not more disturbingly, the Indian middle class is in support of these rebellious peasants, writing newspapers and plays about the plight of the indigo workers.

VATICANECUMENICALCOUNCIL;The First Ecumenical Council of the Vatican was the twentieth Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church and the first to occur since the Council of Trent over four hundred years ago. Spanning two years of theological debate and doctrinal planning, 744 Catholic bishops from across the globe convened in Rome to define the Church's doctrine, in response to the massive emergence of new ideologies such as liberalism, Marxism, and rationalism. The Vatican I Council would in the end ratify two constitutional documents: the incipit "Dei Filius", and "Pastor aeternus," which defined both the primacy of St. Peter among the Apostles of Christ and the doctrines of papal supremacy and papal infallibility. The latter would ultimately result in significant backlash against Catholicism as a political presence in secular states across Europe. It would ignite the Prusso-German "Kulturkampf" and result in both France and Austria annulling their historic concordats with the Papal Curia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Britain is home to thousands of Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews, with hopes high among them for political emancipation. Notable signs of reforms granting British Jews political freedoms have emerged in recent years: for example, financier Moses Haim Montefiore was knighted in 1830, and Isaac Lyon Goldsmid became the first Jewish baronet in England four years later.

rudd_concession_title;The Rudd Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rudd_concession_desc;With recent diamond and gold rushes taking place in Kimberley, Witwatersrand and other areas located south of Lobengula's Kingdom of Matabeleland, many suspect that there may be huge untapped resources to be exploited in his lands. Thus, it has been proposed that we conduct a treaty that gives us exclusive mining rights in his domains. We might even be able to deceitfully sneak in a couple clauses unbeknownst to the natives, a common trick when dealing with Africans who can't read English-language treaties. This could eventually give us justification for annexing Matabeleland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUDD;Charles Dunell Rudd, a business associate of the famed diamond mining magnate Cecil Rhodes, has arrived in Bulawayo with a proposal for a treaty between the British South Africa Company and our kingdom. We can't read the treaty ourselves since it is in English, but Rudd tells us that the terms are as follows: We indefinitely sign away mining rights in our lands to the Company. In return, it provides us with 1,000 Martini-Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of ammunition and a large lump sum of British pounds followed by a perpetual monthy payment. This could help strengthen our army and be key in defending ourselves from attacks by our neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUDDSUCCESS;King Lobengula of Matabeleland has, after conferring with his council, signed the treaty brought to him by Charles D. Rudd. Unbeknownst to Lobengula, Rudd fooled him by making false promises not actually included in the treaty, such as that no more than ten miners would be allowed to enter Matabeleland and that they would follow his laws. He has effectively allowed us to occupy his land. The right honorable diamond mining magnate Cecil Rhodes has described the concession as so gigantic it is like giving a man the whole of Australia. Another victory for the British Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUDDBRUH;It seems that we have been hoodwinked by the British. Charles D. Rudd assured us that no more than 10 Brits would enter our lands and that they would follow our laws. This was in fact not spelled out in the English-language treaty that we couldn't read. Instead, the British have now sent masses of miners and settlers into our lands. They have come not only to dig the gold but to rob us of our people and country as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUDDREFUSED;Charles D. Rudd has been turned away from King Lobengula's court in Bulawayo. His council advised him against it as they were suspicious of conducting treaties with white men whom they view as generally treacherous and deceitful. This leaves Matabeleland in danger of being snatched up by the Portuguese, the Boers, or even other colonizers from the North. It may be wise to take armed action to ensure it does not fall into the hands of our adversaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRSTMATABELEWAR;Troubling news has reached us from Rhodesia. King Lobengula, who has thus far wisely avoided conflict with us, has, despite his previous promises not to, undertaken a raid against a Shona chief in our settled territories in the North. The chief had formerly been Lobengula's vassal but had declared his allegiance instead to Britain and its laws directly. Lobengula could not let this stand lest his other subservient chiefs do the same and sent out a raiding party to punish the offender. At the sight of a raiding party destroying a friendly chiefdom in our settled lands, the South Africa Company administration dispatched troops to force the attackers into retreat, causing a skirmish with dead and wounded on both sides. This blatant attack on our soil is cause for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRSTMATABELEWARSTARTS;A calamitous mistake has lead us to war with Britain. Chief Gomara, who had previously been our vassal, declared his allegiance instead to the United Kingdom. Naturally, we could not let this stand and sent a raiding party to teach him a lesson lest other chiefs attempt the same. However, British troops arrived and began a skirmish with our forces, causing us to retreat, but not before inflicting casualties on them. This unintended confrontation has now lead to an all-out war for our survival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEBRITISHSTOPPUPPETMAT;Following a skirmish with a raiding party, Britain has relinquished their hold over us. A diplomat has informed us that the United Kingdom no longer views Matabeleland as their protectorate and that the Rudd Concession was fraudulent. The British must have been intimidated by the prospect of all-out war with our forces and opted to avoid it by whatever means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SECONDMATABELEWAR;Matabeleland has risen up in revolt. Mlimo, the Ndebele religious leader, is responsible. By blaming our benevolent colonial administration for every ill befalling the natives from cattle disease to crop failure, he has angered the tribesmen so severely that they have attacked several of our settlements. Swift action is necessary if we are to relieve the sieges before our settlers are massacred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAMNMATABELE2;After we invaded the Rozvi Empire on our way northward after having been defeated by the Boer Trekkers, we achieved dominance over the region. However, Tohwechipi, the son of Rozvi Emperor Chirisamhuru escaped to the Buhera area and built up his influence in the last decades. We have asked him to swear fealty but were met with rejection. We must bring the last remainder of the Rozvi Empire under our control if we are to secure our position. \n\n§RWarning: You have to merge the brigades that are generated by this event§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAMNMATABELE2ROZVI;The Matabele have launched an invasion of our remaining lands. Our continued resistance to their aggressive influence has lead to a gradual increase in conflict resulting in this escalation. If we manage to defeat them now, we will gloriously retake our former Empire. But if we are defeated, it will spell the end for our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
warden_line_title;The Warden Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;
warden_line_desc;Captain Henry Douglas Warden, British Resident among the tribes living beyond the Frontier to the North-East, has proposed proclaiming sovereignty over the region of Transorangia, or the land North of the Orange river. The Orange River Sovereignty would allow us to create a new northward buffer towards the Boers and the Sotho, give us new opportunities to exploit possible resources and allow us to expand further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRANSORANGIAPPEARS;The British Resident among the tribes living beyond the Frontier to the North-East, Captain Douglas Warden, has proclaimed the Orange River Sovereignty. This British territory spans the land between the Orange and Vaal Rivers. We could attempt to resist the Anglos, but their forces are numerically, strategically and technologically superior. It would be wise to simply accept the lost territory rather than being annexed entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He believes that swift action is necessary to prevent peoples like the Bamangwato from being threatened by Boer freebooters encroaching on their territory from the South. Businessmen have also shown interest in the endeavor, as there may be goldfields in Bechuanaland similar to those found nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

STJOHNSCITYFIRE;The quiet town of St. John's in Labrador and Newfoundland is reeling from the worst natural disaster it has ever faced. At mid-afternoon today, a fire from a local stable spread across the entire town, destroying the majority of it. Its spread was exacerbated by wind currents that blew it into sections across the town--it would otherwise have stayed in a small area of it. Refugees then took refuge in the stone walls of the Cathedral of John the Baptist, in the nave and transepts of which they stored their valuables. Alas, despite these townsfolk's belief that the stone would block the flames, the cathedral was destroyed as well as much of the inhabitants' property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE;"I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."\n\n Today, socialist Christian minister Francis Bellamy published a model oath of allegiance to the United States in children's magazine The Youth's Companion, of which he is the circulation manager. He writes this pledge out of a deep love for social equality, which he ties to the foundational principles of his country. He aspires for future generations to carry on that love, so that he, in his words, will not have died in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SACCOVANZETTI;The American public is left outraged by the execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two Italian-born anarchists accused of robbery and murder in Braintree, Massachusetts. A highly contentious trial in which conflicting evidence cast extreme doubt on their guilt, the two were sentenced to death by the electric chair. The trial became complicated by a set of appeals made by a defense committee made on their behalf, though it was all in vain.\n\nOutrage ensued, with the court being accused of being prejudiced against Italians, who have become one of the largest immigrants groups in recent times, and anarchists. Furthermore, leftists the world over are protesting the execution, including in every major North American and European city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
antiquities_act_title;The Antiquities Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
antiquities_act_desc;A bill known as the Antiquities Act has entered Congress. If it were to pass and become a law, it would set aside federal land to create national monuments. This act bases the creation of national monuments on the belief that these lands are "objects of historic and scientific interest." In a time of rapid industrialization and urban growth, our government finds it imperative to stop our most valuable cultural assets from being lost. Call it a blow to capitalism, a step forward for humanity--or both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lydenburg_swaziland_line_title;A Border Treaty with Swaziland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lydenburg_swaziland_line_desc;The Kingdom of Swaziland under Mswati II has been increasingly endangered from all sides. Located between Portuguese Mozambique, the Zulu, our Boer Republic and the British, the Swazi seem destined to be conquered. However, King Mswati II has signalled his willingness to negotiate to diplomatically preserve his domain, as he would inevitably lose on the battlefield. We already conducted a minor border treaty in 1846, which -- though it only roughly delimited our border and Swaziland only ceded us land it had no control over anyway -- shows a willingness to give up land rather than face an invasion. Perhaps the time has come to once again pressure the Swazi into giving up land to our benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SWAZILYDENBURG;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ bearing a proposed treaty have arrived in $CAPITAL$. In essence, it would cede a large portion of our land in exchange for 160 heads of cattle. The deal is obviously deeply unfair, as the land we and our ancestors have inhabited for generations is infinitely more valuable than a measly pile of meat that wouldn't even feed our nation for a day. However, the Boers are likely to take the land by force if we refuse to sign the treaty. With their western weapons and larger army, we would likely lose many men in addition to the land. Perhaps surrendering it now would be for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SWAZILYDENBURGYES;King Mswati II has begrudgingly signed the treaty we proposed to him. Our forces have moved into the ceded lands and the agreed 160 heads of cattle have been delivered in exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SWAZILYDENBURGNO;King Mswati II has angrily refused to sign the treaty we proposed to him. Swaziland has begun preparing for war, as they view the deal as deeply unjust and aggressive. Shall we teach them a lesson and take the land for ourselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEKHUKHUNETROLLS;War has broken out with the Bapedi Kingdom led by Sekhukhune I. They have long been a thorn in our side, taking refuge in the mountains of the East and ambushing our forces only to disperse into the wilderness once more. Despite the Bapedi having been infuriatingly successful at defeating our troops, we are forced to commit more men to the area, because not doing so would mean admitting defeat to a bunch of tribesmen and great humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GAZALOSESINHAMBANE;With recent instability in our kingdom, Portugal has seized the opportunity and invaded our coastal lands. Portuguese influence has been slowly creeping into our domains for a while now. Their stronger presence would surely be much more difficult to rid ourselves of than fifteen years ago, especially considering our current instability. Perhaps it is for the best if we accept our territorial losses and lick our wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIMAWEBATTLE;A raiding party of around a thousand Boers has crossed into our lands from the Southeast. Their justification for this aggression is that the chief of the Bakgatla-ba-ga mmanana has supposedly committed several murders in Boer lands and that they have arrived to capture and punish him. After other Tswana tribes joined us to fight the outside attacker in unison, a pitched battle took place, leading to an initial Boer victory followed by a successful counterattack using captured rifles of fallen Boers. Both sides have sustained large casualties, but it is not a full defeat as the Boers to the North have used it to expand their influence to the Marico and Limpopo rivers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIMAWEBATTLEBOER;A battle has taken place between our forces and a horde of Tswana tribesmen. An expedition had been sent into the Bamangwato lands to punish the chief of the Bakgatla-ba-ga mmanana who has committed several murders in Boer lands and subsequently fled Northwest. Surprisingly, Tswana tribes banded together to defend him, eventually overwhelming our forces in the heat of battle, forcing us into a humiliating retreat. While we have certainly taught the Tswana a lesson they won't soon forget, inflicting many casualties on them, it is certainly shameful to have to retreat, but nevertheless we have been able to use it to give time to Boer militias to the north to expand their influence to the Limpopo and Marico rivers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thankfully, an opportunity has presented itself: Several missionaries from the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society have arrived in our lands. We could turn them away and prevent them from converting any of our people to their strange religion. Alternatively, if we let them stay, they have informed us that they intend to translate a book that they call the "Bible" into Sesotho, thus giving us a basis to adopt a writing system with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COUNTRYADJTROLLSWINBURG;The Trekkers of Winburg, though they initially defeated the local natives, have now bitten off more than they can chew. The enraged tribesmen have swarmed into the new republic's lands and pose an existential threat to its survival. If we do not send aid to the Boers, they may be entirely wiped out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARICORIVERLOSTNOMATENGWAR;The Boer settlers of the Potchefstroom Republic have encountered significant resistance in the lands they have attempted to settle on the right side of the Vaal River. The natives, expected to be easily defeated and driven off, have proven to be much more formidable, posing a significant threat to the Trekkers. They may even be wiped out by the determined tribesmen if we do not intervene on their behalf. It must, however, be taken into account that sending support so far to the Northeast would be logistically difficult and expensive, especially considering we don't stand to gain much of anything by providing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRANSORANGIAPPEARSWARQUESTION;The local rulers of the lands that we proclaimed to be a part of the Orange River Sovereignty have adamantly and vehemently refused to accept its legitimacy.

SWAZILANDPROCLAMATION1868;Since the border treaty of 1855, we have been steadily increasing our influence over Swaziland. We were even able to establish the levying of customs on the Maputo River within Swazi territory. Now, the culmination of these efforts has been reached. President Andries Pretorius has proclaimed in the Staatscourant newspaper that Swaziland is now annexed. However, no actual steps have been taken to establish sovereignty over it. Portugal, Britain and of course the Swazi themselves have expressed great concern over our unilateral proclamation. Maybe it would be for the best to leave it at that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, our true homeland remained in the South. After licking our wounds and building up a strong army once more, the time came to drive out the Boers once and for all. However, our true homeland is indeed not the land North of the Vaal River. Our great leader, Mzilikazi, a former Zulu lieutenant, originally crossed the Drakensberg Range northward after his relationship with Shaka Zulu soured.

In 1898 he established the Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt. The company had a subscribed capital of 800,000 Deutschmarks, of which Zeppelin contributed 300,000 Deutschmarks: the remainder was provided by various industrialists, including 100,000 Deutschmarks contributed by Carl Berg, whose company provided the aluminium framework of the airship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1840SPAINREV;Two months ago, relations between the two largest parties in Spain--the Progressive Party, leaning liberal, and the Moderate party, leaning conservative--broke after Evaristo's plan to reform the function of town councils, reducing their autonomy and making them all appointed from Madrid, caused a huge political divide. The Progressives automatically rejected the plan, saying it was against the 1837 Constitution. But the plan was approved by the Moderate majority, and the Progressives abandoned the Chamber, launching a war of words against the Moderates in the press.\nThe Progressives have recently sought the support of Baldomero Espartero, a general who came to exert immense influence in politics after he took credit for victory in the Carlist War. Espartero agreed to help the Progressives and staged a peaceful coup against the Captaincy-General of Barcelona fifteen days ago. Today, revolts have occurred all over Spain calling for the overthrow of the regent, Maria Cristina. She abdicated her position as regent at 3 PM, and a new government under General Espartero will take the keys to the Chamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1843SPAINREV;Espartero's legitimacy in the people's eyes is over. A diverse coalition against his reign has pressured him to dissolve the Cortes Generales and call for a new election. Upon its completion, Espartero is expected to step down for the ushering in of Spain's newest monarch, Isabel II--who as of now is still underage by one year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISABELIITHRONE;To finalize the ousting of Espartero as regent, the Cortes Generales have declared Isabel II of age one year early and sworn her in as Queen Regent of Spain--the first in Spanish history. Her ascension comes as the result of her father, King Fernando VII, issuing the Pragmatic Solution, which ensured his dynasty would continue despite him not having a son. This act is destined to create tension amongst progressives, liberals, and the nascent Carlist movement. Thankfully, the military's support is enough of a bulwark against a coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1917SALVADOREARTHQUAKE;A 6.7 magnitude earthquake has occurred today near the capital of El Salvador, followed by the Quezaltepeque Volcano erupting.

At 20:45 another quake hit, which coincided with Quezaltepeque erupting through the Los Chintos crater. In the end, the total death toll was 1050 deaths caused by the earthquakes, 1100 by Quezaltepeque erupting and 100 from the fires in the city of San Salvador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They claim that the Queen has been “kidnapped” by the progressives in government through her tutor, Agustín de Argüelles, and they demand that María Cristina be restored to her position of regent. The pronouncement has attracted the support of disgruntled Carlist soldiers as well as more reactionary moderates hoping to secure a royal union between the feuding branches of the Bourbons. Fortunately, we have discovered the movements of this conspiracy before it could be carried out, forcing the plotters to revolt in Pamplona ahead of schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SUCESOSJEREZ;For decades now there have been widespread peasant rebellions as a result of severe poverty and inequality. Last year in Jerez, one of the most important trade cities in Andalusia, hundreds of fieldworkers mobbed in the city to demand economic change and better living conditions. Within hours the military was able to put down the insurrection, but not before three men were killed: a tax official and a wine salesman, killed for their bourgeois associations, and a soldier, shot by mistake. In the aftermath of the uprising, the Civil Guard were tasked with forcefully suppressing the activities and publishing of anarchists and the labor movement. Media coverage of the event and the sentencing of those arrested was largely conveyed through mainstream outlets who decried the violent anarchism which they claimed to have spawned the event. The detained workers faced harsh and often violent sentences, doing little to abate protests and riots across the rest of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ROCKALLSHIPDEATH;SS Pieter de Coninck was an ocean liner built in 1881 for Theodore C. Engels & Co, before getting sold to the Danish company Dampskibs-selskabet Thingvalla and renamed SS Norge. In 1898 it made the headlines when it crashed and broke a French brigantine in two, causing the deaths of sixteen fishermen. Thingvalla was sold to Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab later that year, placing Norge in their Scandinavia-America Line. While on it's way to New York City, the ship ran aground near Rockall due to foggy wheater, causing the hull to get ripped with holes. Although the crew began lowering lifeboats shortly after, only five of the eight boats on board were put on water successfully.

SALVADORCOUP1931;News has reached us today that the Salvadoran Armed Forces have toppled our democratic elected president after a period of continuous political tension and public unrest. Reportedly the final straw for the coup d'état were the administration plans for reducing the military budget, which were met with heavy resistance by the officers after the government proved unable to pay their wages. The officers established the Civic Directory as a provisional government in the mean time, as they discuss who shall become the next president of El Salvador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BEZDNAREVOLTRUS;Following our recent abolition of serfdom, peasants in Kazan were lead to revolt by former serf Anton Petrov, convinced that the local officials had misinterpreted the Emancipation Reform. Thousands of peasants, stirred by Petrov, claimed that their emancipation was gained in full and refused to work or pay their dues to the landowners. As the local government failed to convince the group to stand down, soldiers were sent for at the behest of the landowners. The peasants defied the order to turn over Petrov, after which the military opened fire, killing or wounding hundreds and allowing for the capture and eventual execution of Anton Petrov.\nIn the aftermath of the unrest, students at Kazan University arranged a requiem service for the dead. Afanasy Shchapov, a historian at Kazan University, gave the eulogy. Shchapov's speech portrayed Petrov as prophetic liberator of the peasantry, a nigh-revolutionary act for which he has been taken into custody, his fate ours to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SLOVAKIA1848DESC;Nauka reci Slovenskej (in contemporary Slovak "Náuka reci slovenskej") is a literary work with which Ludovít Štúr laid the foundations of literary Slovak language in terms of grammar. He pointed out various grammatical phenomena and explained them with many examples, which made his work one of the high-quality grammar manuals of the Slovak language. Štúr's work had a positive impact on the Slovak political and spiritual life, succeeding not only in eliminating the dual use of two literary languages—West Slovak and Czech—but also in enabling the unification of the Slovak people through a standardized written Slovak language. This development in Slovak literature will lay the foundation for national renewal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CATWANTSFEDERALISM;Immediately responding to our proclamation of the Spanish Republic, Catalans have proclaimed the creation of a Republic of Catalonia. The Provisional Council of Barcelona, seeking now to become the governing body of the Catalan state, declared three days of celebration, with parades in Barcelona's streets and buildings decorated in flags. What remains to be done, however, is the organization of such a Catalan state into a unitary or federal republic--an issue which, despite the state not being recognized anyway, hampers its growth into a viable country. All Madrid can do is sit back and watch the Catalans sort themselves out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CANTONALREB;A massive insurrection has broken out across Spain! In Salamanca, Sevilla, Cádiz, Granada, Cartagena, Valencia and many other cities, local 'intransigent' republicans have risen up to implement a federal system 'from the bottom up' instead of 'from the top down', intending to form cantons as part of the federation to come not by the slow policy of the Cortes Generales but by immediate violent uprisings. The republicans have irrevocably shattered into two camps due to the revolutionary actions of the 'intransigents'. This leftist infighting has eroded the already slim base of support for the republic, destabilizing it immensely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSASINALMOSTISABELII;Martín Merino, a former Franciscan priest and liberal activist, has been executed for attempted murder of Queen Isabella in the Royal Palace. Merino successfully slipped past the guards to enter the palace, after having attended service at the nearby Church of San Justo. Isabella was preparing to attend her own churching ceremony, which was to happen on that day, after having given birth to her daughter Infanta Isabel a month earlier. Merino intercepted the Queen in the palace and stabbed her in the abdomen with a dagger. The queen survived, the blade having been cushioned by her corset's stays. Merino was arrested without resistance and revealed during interrogation that he also planned to murder the Head of the Council of Ministers and former Queen Consort María Christina--Queen Isabella's mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LICEUBOMBATTACK;Barcelona's Liceu theater, renowned for its shows attended by high society, was rocked tonight by an anarchist bombing attack. During a show of Rossini's William Tell, anarchist militant Santiago Salvador Franch dropped two Orsini bombs from the Liceu's fifth floor, intending to indiscriminately kill theatergoers on the lower floors. Franch's first bomb landed on the 13th floor and exploded on impact. The second landed directly into the lap of a woman who perished in the first explosion, killing and wounding those on that floor and the 14th. Seven people immediately died in the detonations, while 13 others succumbed to their wounds later.\n\nFranch confessed that this attack was a price-tag killing for the execution of fellow anarchist Paulino Pallás Latorre, who attempted to kill Catalonian Captain General Campos two months earlier. The Liceu was targeted because anarchists saw it as a decadent symbol of the bourgeoisie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With chaos in Guatemala having lead to the government of the state being deposed and the formation of a new state, Los Altos, $FROMCOUNTRY$'s weakness and instability has been revealed all too clearly to their people. Especially conservatives, still furious about José Gregorio Salazar y Castro being ousted from power by the legislative assembly despite being democratically elected, have supported Nicaragua's secession from their federation. As their overlords, we must intervene to save our influence in the area from outside threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CATALANSTRIKEONE;News has reached us that a large labor strike is taking place in Catalonia. The strike was first started after the killing of Josep Barceló Cassadó, a Catalan labor leader, by local authorities. The strike has been organized by local workers in Catalonia's textile industry. The workers have started demanding better working conditions and a higher wage. Despite our best efforts, the strike has quickly spread and engulfed other industries in the region, presently involving up to 100,000 workers. Our officials in the area have repeatedly tried to break up the strikes and to arrest their leaders, however the strikes have continued for several weeks and have caused significant turmoil in Catalonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CATALANSTRIKETWO;The merchants and industrialists of Barcelona, enraged by the tax hikes put in place to pay for the expenses of the Spanish–American War, have been led by their mayor into a strike. \nThe strikers have shut down their businesses and industrial establishments, creating a situation in which they are untaxable. The personal and corporate tax rates in Catalonia, higher than even in our capital of Madrid, have created a feeling of betrayal among the Catalan upper and middle classes, who had fought alongside and been largely loyal to Spanish nobility. \nBarcelona lies in a state of emergency, and the strike has spread to neighboring cities in the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NOCHEDESANDANIEL;We have received news of a shocking slaughter of students and workers of the Central University of Madrid, including women, children and the elderly. The act has been perpetrated by units of our military, with the students being brutally attacked whilst performing a serenade in support of their rector, Juan Manuel Montalbán at the Puerta del Sol. Montalbán was deposed 3 days ago by order of our government because of his failure to dismiss Professor Emilio Castelar after his recent publications in the newspaper titled ''La Democracia'', which was critical of Queen Isabel II. The backlash from Juan Manuel Montalbán's dismissal and replacement by a new rector provoked the protesters to act. This afternoon, students and workers came to the Puerta del Sol, being dispersed once more by soldiers indiscriminately firing into the crowd. The attacks were successful in dispersing the protesters, though they left behind around 10 dead and 200 wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NORMESORTOGRAFIQUES;The Orthographic Norms, commissioned by the Institute for Catalan Studies, are a list of 24 rules aimed at standardizing written Catalan, which has until now lacked a unified orthography. \nThe commissioners' goal was to bring Catalan up to par with other European languages - to equip writers with the ability to communicate advanced concepts in the language of the people. The rules were swiftly embraced by writers and journalists, paving the way for schools and universities to educate students in the common tongue, and eventually becoming the standard of local business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NORMESCASTELLO;The "Normes de Castelló", a set of orthographic rules concerning the Valencian language, have recently been approved and ratified in Castelló de la Plana by prominent cultural and political figures of the Valencian Country. A total of 34 orthographic rules were agreed on to provide a basis for the normification for Valencian spelling. Regarding these orthographic rules, two prominent aspects stand out: Firstly, orthographic model is quite similar to the one used by the primary authors of the Valencian Renaissance, including but not limited to Teodor Llorente Olivares. Secondly, it shares certain structures of the orthographic rules of the Catalan language that were formulated in 1913 by the Institute d'Estudis Catalans. The high conformity with which the new orthographic rules are being implemented is surprising: Practically all Valencian writers, associations and main newspapers are using them without question. With Valencian spelling finally codified and mutually agreed upon, the study and preservation of the language has become easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SANTCARLESRAPITA;Captain General of the Baelaric Islands, Jaime Ortega y Olleta landed on Sant Carles de la Ràpita with an army of 3000 men from the Baelaric garrison in an effort to trigger a revolt in our forces in Catalonia and force Queen Isabell II to abdicate in favor of the Carlist pretender, Carlos VI. Initially supported by both Carlos and his brother Infante Fernando, as well as the archbishop of Toledo Cirilo de Alameda, the garrison quickly started losing support for the general, as they weren't informed on the reason for their expedition. Eventually the soldiers turned on their general in favor of the queen and the government, forcing the pretenders to flee towards Ulldecona. The traitorous general got captured by our forces 3 days after his landing and sentenced to death by the court martial. The Carlist pretenders, later captured by the Guardia Civil, were given amnesty in exchange for both signing their resignation to the throne of Spain, and were both deported to France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARSENIOCAMPOS;During a military parade led by General Arsenio Martínez Campos in Barcelona, an assassination attempt unfolded. The general sustained minor injuries, but the attack resulted in sixteen people being seriously wounded, with one of them, a civil guard, dying shortly after. \n\nThe perpetrator, an anarchist named Paulino Pallás, was apprehended and subsequently sentenced to death, with his execution taking place two weeks later. Pallás claimed during the trial that he was seeking revenge for the execution of four anarchists in Jerez de la Frontera the previous year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VILLAREJOPRONOUNCEMENT;The aftermath of the Massacre of St. Daniel's Night was cluttered and confusing. With the dismissal of General Ramón Narváez, Duke of Valencia, from the position of Prime Minister, Gen. Leopoldo O'Donnell formed a Unión Liberal government. Gen. Juan Prim, a leader of the Progressives, attempted to get the Progressives to cease their withdrawal from voting, but was unable to do so. \nWith no other course of action, Prim attempted a pronouncement, attempting to force the Queen to make him the Prime Minister of Spain. Prim attempted to carry out a military-only coup with no civilian assistance, believing that the move would make his success easier. However, due to the preparations of O'Donnell, most military units in Madrid remained loyal to the government. Several units abandoned Prim, and the rest traveled around Castille before fleeing into Portugal without attacking the city of Madrid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANGILUPRISING;Following the failure of the Pronuncimento of General Prim a year earlier, and the onset of financial maladies in Spain, General Prim continued his work of Progressive agitation in Spain. With the stated objective of overthrowing the Queen, supporters of the coup would designate Ricardo Muñiz as the man responsible for agitating the working classes of Madrid to join the revolt. Among the revolters was Spanish politician and future Prime Minister Práxedes Sagasta. The uprising was planned for the 26th of June, 1866. \nFearful of government anticipation, the revolt occurred 4 days earlier than planned. Artillery units roamed around Madrid, while progressives and democrats fought on barricades and government generals fanned out around the city to ensure the loyalty of the other military units. The rebels attempted to enter the Queen's palace but were stopped by loyal units. The revolt was eventually contained to the barracks by the 23rd and suppressed by the afternoon of the 23rd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was accompanied by Italian climbers Louis  and Jean-Antoine Carrel. At 6,263 m, the ascent marks the highest point that European mountaineers have ever reached. While in the 17th and 18th century, the mountain was thought to be the highest point on Earth, we now know of higher peaks in the Himalayas that have not yet been conquered. Edward Whymper also made a collection of amphibians and reptiles that he handed over to George Albert Boulenger at the British Museum which is now on exhibition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As such, the decree states that slavery in all its forms has been abolished in all French colonies and possessions, all French citizens are forbidden from participating in the practice in any regard and all former slaves are granted the status of citizens of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The inhabiting Sakalava people are generally involved in the slave trade and should not put up noteworthy resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOSYBECOLONIZED;A French expedition has taken control of Nosy Be just off of our coast. Although a military post so close to our homeland is a direct threat to our sovereignty, with the Merina right outside of our borders we can't risk turning our attention elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHPROTECTIONAKR;Ever since our rebellion against the Merina in 1835, we've made numerous unsuccessful attempts to expel them from our kingdom. However, following a betrayal of one of our own, we were forced to retreat all the way to Nosy Mitsio. With our kingdom on the brink of collapse, King Tsimiaro has decided to sail to the French island of Bourbon as a last resort. By personally offering to become a protectorate as well as granting ownership of several of our islands, the French can be persuaded to protect us from further Merina aggression. Submitting to the Europeans may be an unthinkable act, but it's the only way to ensure our people's survival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HELLVILLEMEETING;A most peculiar guest has arrived before the Governor of the island of Bourbon today: The exiled king of Antankarana. He had barely made it out alive after numerous clashes with the rival Kingdom of Imerina, which is why he is offering us his kingdom's loyalty as well as legal ownership of its northwestern islands in return for military protection to check the Merina advance. The island's terrain makes fighting a grueling task, but gaining a foothold on the island's North and the support of the locals makes this a worthwhile task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NATIONALWORKSHOPSFRA;France is suffering from an economic depression and widespread unemployment. This was beneficial in causing the unrest that dethroned our previous king, but it also makes our new position precarious. While the revolutionaries were united against the monarchy, cracks are beginning to form. Louis Jean Joseph Blanc, a radical member of the provisional government, has proposed the creation of so-called "national workshops", where the unemployed are offered work at government-run sites. There, they may perform unskilled labor at a low wage for the common good, such as construction of new housing or roads. While such a program would unquestionably be quite costly, if we don't take action to assist the unemployed, dissatisfied §Rradical Parisians may overthrow the provisional government§! and expel the moderates.

french_revolution_end_desc;After months of discussion among members of the provisional government concerning the future French political system, a compromise has been reached. While the revolution was at first quite radical, more moderate and even conservative elements of the population have increased their influence to the extent that the extremists have been outweighed significantly. The new constitution re-affirms the provisional government's policy of universal suffrage. Instead of the right to work, which is strongly desired by the left, the constitution simply grants the unemployed a "right to assistance". Propositions such as the separation of church and state, banning members of the Bonaparte family from running for office and abolishing the death penalty are rejected by the conservatives and thus not included in the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RADICALCOUP1848FRA;Unemployed Parisians, disillusioned after the revolution failed to improve their situation, have taken up arms against the provisional government. Egged on by radical politicians like Louis Blanc, these radicals stormed the government buildings in Paris, arresting and in some cases lynching the ministers of the provisional government. Peasant leaders have formed a new ruling council, organizing the new second revolution and taking control of the administration. With supporters ousting bourgeois officials across France, new reforms have already been successfully instituted with much speed to alleviate the situation of the peasants. It would seem that the new government is here to stay - much to the displeasure of the European monarchies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

no_more_national_workshops_desc;Ulysse Trélat, a moderate member of the provisional government has, with the support of conservative figures outside of government, demanded the end of the National Workshops. The streets of Paris have been re-paved, and the situation of the populace has been somewhat alleviated. They argue that the cost of employing over a hundred thousand people is at this point not worth the results and must therefore be ended. While the radicals in government protest Trélat's demand, it seems that most of France agrees with his sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WORKSHOPSREBELLION;Angered by the abrogation of the National Workshop program, Parisians who are now once again unemployed and without government support have taken to the streets in an attempt to overthrow the provisional government. The city was divided into two camps, with the dividing line running from Montmartre in the Northeast down to the Porte Saint-Denis, across the Île de la Cité and, skirting the rue Saint-Jacques, to the city limits. Archbishop Denys Auguste Affre of Paris attempted to broker a ceasefire by stepping between national guardsmen and the rebels only to be killed by a stray bullet. After several days of bitter fighting, the last barricade in the district of Faubourg Saint-Antoine fell to the National Guard, ending the insurrection. Around 5000 rebels died, and several thousand more were taken captive and are being deported to French Algeria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAKALAVAREVMAD;The Madagascarian aristocracy refused to accept the abolition of slavery in France, uniting under Bahotsivintsy, the leader of a tribal coalition of Sakalava people. The French then were confined to the city of Hell-Ville after the island was quickly overrun by rebels. An army of 4,000 Malagasy descended on the city of Hell-Ville, after burning the port of Ambanoro. French artillery was able to repel the assault and drive back the Sakalava army with heavy losses. \nFollowing the arrival of French reinforcements from Mayotte, the French launched a brutal response into the interior, looting crops, burning canoes, ransacking villages, and pacifying the countryside. All the slaveowners that remained through the revolt and did not defect were compensated, while the rest of the revolting aristocrats received nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLETRESFORQUILLES;While on a training exercise for Prussian warships, Prince Adalbert decided to explore the Rif coast of Morocco, manning two boats and deploying them along the coast. After the boats came under fire from the Moroccans, the SMS Danzig moved to only 600m from the shore to give the boat crews supporting fire. Adalbert then ordered a landing operation led by him personally. This attack was successful and the Moroccans were forced back to a plateau. However, they were also receiving continuous reinforcements and so Adalbert finally decided to withdraw, in case he and his troops were cut off from the shore. Prussian casualties were seven dead and 22 wounded, including Adalbert, shot in the thigh. Despite this failure, the courage of Adalbert and his sailors received high praise from the Prussian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

antisocialistger_desc;With the recent radical attacks on the life of the Emperor, it has become readily apparent that the insidious socialist forces within the Empire, such as the SPD, that inspired these attacks must be curtailed. The proposed law will ban any group or meeting whose aims are to spread social-democratic principles, outlaw trade unions, close several socialist newspapers and ban the display of socialist emblems, and will remain in force for 2 and a half years unless extended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHENANDOAHZANZIBAR;A British merchant named Matthew Isaac Wilson has offered to sell the CSS Shenandoah, a former Confederate commerce raider that was sold to him by the United States after the fall of the Confederacy, to our Sultan. Before its surrender, the ship was one of the most fierce and feared raiders in the Confederate navy, sinking or bonding 38 merchant vessels in the span of 12 and a half months as part of the Confederate effort to disrupt the Union’s economy. This could prove a very valuable addition to our burgeoning state. How should the Sultan respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1872HURRICANEZANZIBAROPT;Quick, save the ships!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1872HURRICANEZANZIBAR;Terrible news! A storm has struck the shores of Zanzibar and wrecked all the docked ships. Many of our plantations are damaged, and it will take a long time to repair them. Hundreds have died due to drowning in sinking ships, being overwhelmed by flooding or being trapped in collapsing buildings. Not only it will cost a lot of money to rebuild the Royal Navy, but our grip on East Africa is also severely weakened by this blow to our military and economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORUNGUSPHEREEVENT;Edouard Bouet-Willaumez's Expedition to Mpongweland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORUNGUBESPHERED;Lieutenant Louis Édouard Bouët-Willaumez was recently sent to the coast of central Africa aboard the steamer l'Africain to patrol and catch slave brigs, enforcing the ban on the slave trade. He has returned, bearing news of successful treaties of protection with local Mpongwe rulers Antchuwè Kowè Rapontchombo and Anguilè Ré-Dowé. This places the coast between Cape Esterias and Cape Lopez firmly under our influence. Perhaps this will lead to a future colonial venture?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASCENSIONAHMEDBEY;Today is a great day! The young prince Ahmad ibn Mustafa has taken the throne today in a grand ceremony fit for a king. After the death of his beloved father, Mustafa ibn Mahmud, Ahmad I has taken over responsibility for ruling the country. He has many ambitions to modernize Tunisia, secure its position and assert our power. May our Tunis grow and prosper under the guidance of our bey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUNISFREEDOMWOMB;The British consul general, Thomas Reade, has just met with Ahmed Bey. He strongly advised the abolition of slavery in Tunisia for two reasons. Firstly, he claims that the practice is inhumane and must be brought to an end for the sake of morality. Secondly, he warns that a colonial power could use the presence of captured white slaves as a pretext to invade us. Ahmed Bey, himself the son of a slave woman, is sympathetic to Reade's arguments. How shall we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUNISSLAVERYNOMORE;Following the freedom of womb instated 4 years ago by Ahmed Bey, he has voiced his intention to finally put an end to slavery altogether. Giuseppe Raffo, a dignitary of Italian origin currently serving as our foreign minister, has drafted a decree that would abolish slavery in any way, shape and form on the territory of the Beylik of Tunisia. Has the time come to grant freedom to over a hundred thousand people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ahmed_bey_naval_reforms_title;Ahmed Bey's Naval Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ahmed_bey_naval_reforms_desc;Ahmed I, Bey of Tunis, is a man with aspirations for a modernized Tunisia. The former navy, the legacy of the corsairs, was struck down in Greece at the battle of Navarino, in 1827. Ahmed has already taken great steps to rebuild Tunisian naval forces and secure the existence of a modernized army, and he has taken similar steps to modernize the naval forces. In 1841, Tunisia bought its first steamship, which sunk a year later, and was replaced. Italian and French naval advisors roam throughout the coastal regions, scouting out natural harbors and potential naval bases for the Bey's consideration, while the harbors at La Marsa are modernized. Year after year, the trappings of the West pierce closer into the Beylik.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PUNICLIBYANINSCRIPTION;Our consul general to Tunis, Thomas Reade, recently became aware of an ancient Lybico-Punic mausoleum located in Dougga dated to the 2nd Century BCE. Recognizing the importance of the bilingual inscription on the mausoleum's interior in decoding the ancient Libyan language, Reade extracted it from the monument and had it dispatched to London for the 'benefit of science', where it now resides in the British Museum. Regrettably, the removal process involved taking the entire wall of stone blocks on which it was inscribed, resulting in the collapse of the two upper floors that had stood for over 1600 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAAMME;"Our land, our land, our Fatherland! Ring out, dear word, oh sound! No rising hill, or mountain grand, no sloping dale, no northern strand, there is, more loved, to be found, Than this — our fathers' ground."\n\nOn this day, Swedish-Finnish poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg published his patriotic hymn "Vårt land," or "Maamme" in Finnish--meaning "Our Land." The song forms the prologue of Runeberg's epic The Tales of Ensign Stål, which tells of Sweden's loss of Finland to the Russian Empire in the 1808 Finnish War. The hymn, despite being originally written in Swedish, forms a basis for a reawakening of Finnish national pride. Perhaps this heralds a new era of nationalism for the Finnish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CORINGACYCLONE;Coringa was a city full of life and riches. It welcomed thousands of ships every year and was an important trade center in Bay of Bengal, until today. A terrifying cyclone of magnitude the locals have never seen before ravaged the city, killing hundreds of thousands of people, and razed the port. While Coringa was no stranger to cyclones, this one made sure that most of the survivors would leave the city to her fate. The city was abandoned by the local population and the officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MOUNTWHITNEY;In the Sierra Nevada range of California, a group of three determined climbers achieved a monumental feat - the first ascent of Mount Whitney, the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States. The climb was arduous and fraught with difficulty, as the team encountered steep snowfields and treacherous rocky terrain. Altitude sickness plagued the climbers, causing them to feel dizzy and short of breath as they approached the summit. But they persevered, pushing themselves to their limits, and eventually, after many hours of grueling ascent, they stood atop the mountain, with its breathtaking views stretching out before them. To commemorate their historic achievement, the team placed a wooden stake at the summit, bearing their names and the date of their successful ascent. Marking the beginning of a new era of mountaineering, with Mount Whitney becoming a sought-after destination for adventurers from around the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TRANSYLVANIANMASSACRES;As the Hungarian Revolution engulfs the land, Romanian loyalists to Austria have taken up arms and begun indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in Transylvania. Incited by local leaders, militiamen wander through villages and mark their inhabitants for death. Large killings occurred in Kisenyed and Nagyenyed, where up to 175 and 1,000 people were killed respectively. The massacres primarily target Hungarians, though Romanians, Germans, and Jews have also fallen victim.\n\nRomanian lawyer Avram Iancu played a role in organizing the militias responsible for the massacres. Troops under his control also engaged the Hungarian army, though their resistance is overshadowed by the wanton destruction they have caused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CATALANSTRIKETHREE;A series of uprisings by disaffected workers have occurred in Barcelona, in which textile factory laborers have broken into their workplaces and destroyed the spinning mules inside. The particular machine targeted in these uprisings, the selfactina--whose name is derived from the term "self-acting machine"--provoked the workers' ire because of it requiring far fewer workers to operate it while spinning far more strings than other machines. This development has led to massive unemployment in Barcelona's textile industry.\n\nThe riots continue to rage on. In one incident, rioters broke into a factory, destroyed all of its selfactinas, and murdered the owner, his son, and the foreman. The Barcelona government-general is deliberating a ban of selfactinas in response, but their manufacturers would surely plea to Madrid to repeal such an effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This plan calls for us, based in small enclaves on the Atlantic coast at Saint-Louis and at a few other posts along the Senegal River, to become the dominant power in the area rather than one among many, wresting control of the terms and conditions of trade between the French wholesalers and the African producers of exportable agricultural products as acacia gum. The plan calls for the French to fortify more points along the Senegal River to make use of force to end the system of tolls by which the Trarzas profit greatly. It also calls for the French to protect the agricultural population of the left bank of the Senegal River from raids by the Mauritanians and from the possible absorbtion of the Wolof state of Waalo, to Trarza.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We must join forces with Liptako to expulse the Dendi to Songhailand where they belong, and bring Islam once and for all to the region. Liptako will be launching it first but with our support, or winning the war would be hard for them, as the Dendi cavalry still remember the days of the Songhai Empire, and their tactics still aren't outdated, regardless of guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_abu_arish_title;Recreate Abu Arish;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_abu_arish_desc;Abu Arish was a kingdom under our influence in the region of the Taiz coast. When we were fighting the Egyptians, the Zaydis took it over, and came closer to Mecca. We must expulse them from the region and bring them under our thumb! §RDue to engine limitations, you will annex the lands of Abu Arish with a status quo Casus Belli, and the Zaydis will have a Casus Belli to get it back.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
start_angola_title;Conquer the Interior of Angola;;;;;;;;;;;;;
start_angola_desc;Despite centuries of European domination of the coast of Angola, the colony's far-flung and vast interior has long eluded our grasp. With growing interest in the territory and recent advances in medicine combatting the endemic diseases, we should consider begin extending our rule eastward.;;;;;;;;;;;;
finish_angola_title;Conquer the Interior of Angola;;;;;;;;;;;;;
finish_angola_desc;The interior of Angola has been granted to us by the Great Powers, and we now may take it without international complaints -- it is $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory!;;;;;;;;;;;;
takeover_lunda_title;Take Over Chokweland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
takeover_lunda_desc;The Lunda Empire, once powerful, is now in decadence. European intervention and the introduction of guns has made its wars more deadly than ever. We are the only state in the region aside from the Great Lakes states that conserve an army capable of conquest, and we could use it to take over Lunda. We once were one of the forming cultures of the Empire, with Chokwes benefiting of the empire, but with its decadence only we can keep intact the greatness of our people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHOKWEEMPIRE;European intervention and the introduction of guns has made its wars more deadly than ever. We are one of the only states in the region that conserve an army capable of conquest, but the Chokwe have started a war of conquest regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mutapa_empire_title;Reform the Mutapa Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mutapa_empire_desc;The Mutapa Empire once spanned all of the Shona peoples, from the coast of Sofala to the highland at the frontier with the Tswana. If we become again the strongest Shona state, we can take the title of the Monomutapa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_luvale_title;Claim Luvale;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_luvale_desc;The Luvale are a mixture of the Lozi, Lunda, Mbundu and Chokwe peoples, and once belonged to our Barotse state. For these reasons, Luvale will always and has always been an integral part of our kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_prazos_title;Centralize the Massangano;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_prazos_desc;The Massangano are a series of kingdoms of partial Portuguese descent that are on the banks of the Zambezi river, from Inhambina to Vila de Sena. Some of them are really powerful, and hold great armies, but claim partial allegiance to our state. If we want to keep our expansion in the region, we must take the Massangano and expand on the Zambezi river. Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_prazos_songo_title;Conquer the Southern Matakenya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_prazos_songo_desc;The Matakenya currently own Songo, which is at the end of the land we oficially claim for ourselves in the Zambezi River. We need to take such city so we can effectively occupy our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_cnr_title;Start Centralizing the Bilad as-Siba;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_cnr_desc;The Berber and Bedouin tribes of the interior claim allegiance to our kingdom, but they keep rebelling and being a weakness to our state. The Europeans use this weakness to attack us, and we must end it via exerting real control over our territory. Centralizing will be a costly and slow process, but it will be worth it.\n\n§RYou need at least 55% civilization progress, the tooltip lies.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_cnr_2_b_title;Annex Guelmim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_cnr_2_b_desc;The Berber and Bedouin tribes of Tarfaya don't claim allegiance to our kingdom, but their northern lands keep rebelling and being a weakness to their state. We must expand to the Draa river and take Guelmim, to find our natural border between the semideserts of Bujadur and the Sahara to the South, and the Atlas Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_cnr_2_title;Centralize the Interior;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralize_cnr_2_desc;The last step to centralize our kingdom is here. The Berber and Bedouins finally are under our state, and Moroccan flags wave over the desert. We have finally centralized Morocco, and brought prosperity to our people. We are now a power to take into account, and colonizing us will be impossible thanks to our great army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ODIENEKABADUGU;A Mandinka king by the name of Vakaba Toure is fielding troops at Kulukoro, a region between us and the Baté, with the goal of overthrowing our kingdom. In 1845, he with his cousin Vasanissi went to defend maternal relatives in Kulukoro against Cisse, Vanassi killed Cisse in an ambush and the cousins convinced his army to support them in an attack against us. We must move fast or we will end up dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GWIRIKOCHANGE;We once were part of the Kong Empire, but its dependence on the slave trade made them weak enough for them to leave Bobo Dioulasso without any way to retaliate. They have been trying to take us over with raids since, but have been unsuccessful. With our kingdom not being in the best conditions, they are trying again - but this time it isn't just raids, but their entire army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GWANDUCHANGE;With the war at Liptako, our state has changed. Being a part of Sokoto might end up marking our downfall, and independence is tempting. We must hold our breath under the sun of Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KWARARAFADED;Our state has survived everything under the sun -- the Sokoto Jihad, the Kanem-Bornu, the Adamawa, the coastal confederations... the list is almost infinite. Over our greatness, though, is our weakness, and the Jukun have grown tired of our state. The Jukun have united under Zikenyu Tsokwa Tasefu, and a town after another have fallen without a battle. The Chamba people, expulsed by the Fulani, are going down the Benue, and instead of allying with us, they have united with Zikenyu Tsokwa Tasefu's forces to bring us down, on the condition of letting them settle on our territory. Our end is as near as this night, or maybe the next, might be the last one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COASTZANZIBAR;Parts of the Zanzibari coast have been ruled by our state for years, but as we expand, the peoples that ruled over these areas have united into a confederation, one which wants to take back the Coast of Zanzibar, and be ruled independently from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BEIHANCHANGE;Sharif al-Barak ibn 'Abil's Beihan is as powerful as it has been at any point in history. Our plains are fertile, and our power extends to the coast. We hope our kingdom never sinks under the sand of the unending desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISAAQCHANGE;Farah Guled, the second Grand Sultan of Isaaq, who lead our forces to victory against the British in the 1827 Battle of Berbera, has passed away. Now, his son, Hassan Farah, has succeeded him as Grand Sultan. The ancient port of Berbera has, in recent years, been fought over between the Ayal Ahmed and Ayal Yunis branches of the Habr Awal clan. As one of his first acts as Grand Sultan, Hassan Farah has brought the warring subclans before a holy relic from the tomb of Aw Barkhadle, one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad, and made them swear to bury all animosity and live as brethren. Thus, Hassan Farah has once again brought peace and good fortune to the Sultanate of Isaaq. May it prosper forevermore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OVIMBUNDUCHANGE;Our power is becoming our weakness. Our state has in its borders a trade route which brings guns and other European goods to the center of the continent, and all products are taxed if they pass through us. The Portuguese, though, are trying to centralize their dominions in Africa, and our trade routes might become a target which we can't get rid of. Under this new sun, we hope we shall prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIOCHANGE;Oral tradition holds that we probably settled along the rainy, hot, and humid river valleys of northern and western Congo in the early centuries of the 1st millennium. We suffered during the active slave capture, trade, and export in the 18th and 19th centuries, where "thousands of Mongo people as captured slaves passed through the Zanzibar route by the Arabs". We must survive in this newfound world of greatness and weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANGARACHANGE;Our kingdom is between the prosperous Zulu and the warring Xhosa, with our neighboring British nearing in. Our place in the region, though, grants us the control of the trade routes, and we're slowly becoming a truly powerful kingdom, one to not be left behind in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LUGURUCHANGE;Our people are settled in the wetlands of Mombasa, and our state is between the prosperous Zanzibar and the warring Unyanyembe and Maasai, making us always be under threat. With the Omani and the Europeans encroaching on the coasts, and the Tanzanian kingdoms preparing for a battle to behold, we can only hope our future isn't sentenced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UJIJICHANGE;Our sultanate can now only grow more powerful. Our connections with the Omani and the kingdoms of the interior make us an integral part of the region, and Ujiji is full of traders from all corners of the region. All goods to be ever owned pass through our state, and our land is fertile. We hope our greatness is unending and our future bright!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KILWACHANGE;We have survived. Our sultanate has reunited in the face of the Omani, and the Swahili won't be taken as easily as the Arabs think. Our army grows strong, and our navy prepares for battle. The Omani shall be defeated and the greatness of the Kilwa Sultanate restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MANDARACHANGE;Our kingdom is between the always-falling Baguirmi and the powerful Kanem-Bornu Empire. Our sphere of influence is nothing compared to Bornu's, and we are de facto their tributary. We must though keep this status or our sovereignty might fall under Bornu, Waddai or even the Adamawa. Our region's future is uncertain, and we must keep all our numbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAARTATOUCONQUEST;al-Hadj Umar Tall's jihad has arrived to Kaarta, with 50 thousand men and French guns, putting Nioro into a quick siege. We hope our great army continues the jihad and brings Islam to all corners of the Sudan!;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIEGEMEDINAFORTTOU;Our rapid expansion has led to several skirmishes with the French army. With the authorization of his ally, Khasso Queen Hawa Demba Diallo, Governor Faidherbe ordered a fort built at the Khasso village of Medina, not far from Kayes, in 1855. In late April 1857, our entire army marched on Medina, and started a 3-month-long siege. Fort Medina's garrison consisted in the fort's commander Paul Holle, seven French soldiers, 22 Senegalese Tirailleurs and 34 sailors from Saint-Louis. The siege was lifted some days ago after the fort, with European guns and massive arming of the population, had survived 3 months under full siege. Governor Faidherbe arrived with 500 men after the Senegal river's flow increased thanks to massive rains in the highlands, and our hope to take Kayes and unite with Futa Tooro has been shattered. We though have signed a treaty with the French which lets us annex the interior without French intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLETOUSEGOU;Our army, well trained, regimented, and equipped with modern firearms, is the best in the region, and so the Segu can't efficiently resist a conquest of their empire, which is already shaken by rebellions and raids by neighboring Fula states. We shall annex the Bambara Empire and become the biggest empire in the region, bringing Islam to every corner of the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONQUESTMASSINATOU;With Segu secured, we can now launch an attack on Massina, a fellow jihad state. The Massina though don't have the power to bring jihad effectively to the region, so they deserve annexation so they can be part of a powerful Jihad state, one which isn't eclipsed by Sokoto, or any Pagan state in the region. We must enter Hamdullahi and raze it to the ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAKARSAINTLOUISSNGWON;The French have lost, and our coast will keep being ours, with no intervention from any European power. Now that we've won, though, what should we do with the French railroad? Having French infrastructure might lead us into problems we don't want to deal with, but it could also help us westernize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIEGEPLANEIGHTEENFIFTYFOUR;'Today we are invaded by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$. Our army is in disarray. The tiedos of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$, however valiant warriors, have almost all fallen under the enemy's bullets. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ are stronger than us, I know that, but should we leave the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ in the hands of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$?' \nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have started building forts on the banks of the Senegal river, and attacking from there the neighboring kingdoms. Our sovereignty is being contested, and we might not live to see the sun once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WASSOLOUTAKESOVER;Our kingdom is in decadence, and frequent raids weaken us every year. A man called Samori Turé has created a powerful empire inside our territory, and joining it is the only way to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KABADUGUGWIRIKO;We have been raided for decades by the Bobo Kingdom of Gwiriko, and we now search for revenge. We should end them as a threat by annexing their capital into our state, leaving them as a rump state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOTAGAINKENEDUGU;We have been raided for decades by the Senufo Kingdom of Kenedugu. With the Senufo increasingly encroaching into our territory, they have finally shown their true intentions - they want to end our kingdom's existance. This threat can only be an unifying factor in our current situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_south_wafrica_title;The Conquest of the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_south_wafrica_desc;With the slave trade reviving, the search for new slaves has brought the Sahel states to push southwards to previously pagan regions and jungles. With the trade reviving, the states of the Sahel are regaining strength and wielding armies to bring conquest to its neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_kassala_title;The Expedition to Taka;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_kassala_desc;The region of Taka, mostly inhabited by nomadic Beja tribesmen, escaped the attentions of the initial 1820 invasion of Sudan, for Sennar was the goal and they did not deviate from the direct route along the Nile. An expedition to the east was indeed suggested to Ismail Pasha, but the Beja had a warlike reputation in Egypt and he decided against it. While Taka paid tribute after the conquest of the Funj Sultanate, this ceased during Khurshid Pasha's term as governor of Sudan in 1838. This prompted the new governor, Ahmad Pasha, to set out with a small army to take control of Taka. When he confronted Sheikh Mohammed Din of the Hadendoa tribe and demanded tribute, he merely produced one tenth of what he had surrendered to Khurshid Pasha. This has enraged Ahmad Pasha, who has now asked us for our blessing to conduct a punitive expedition and found a new fort in the region to collect tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANNEXMAZRUI;The Mazrui have ruled Mombasa  for now a century and a half, having used the Portuguese's occupation of Zanzibar to build a base of power. They then annexed Malindi and territories near Pate, and the island of Pemba. In 1823 we managed to expulse them from Pate and take Pemba, but they still hold considerable power. Should we send them an ultimatum to end their rebellious existance once and for all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAZRUIOVERQUESTION;The Omanis have tried time and time again to end our rule over Mombasa and the surrounding coastal towns for over a century, but since 1823 they have had enough victories to render us weaker than them. They have sent us an ultimatum - cede the remaining lands administered from Mombasa and Mombasa itself, or war will be upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_southern_hadendowa_title;The Subjugation of the Southern Hadendowa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_southern_hadendowa_desc;The Hadendowa, a clan of the southern Beja, have increasingly come under our influence. After the founding of Kassala in 1840, the Hadendowa initially refused to pay tribute, until Ahmed Pasha el Menekli, governor of Sudan, cruelly stamped out resistance in 1844. He wantonly slaughtered and mutilated the tribesmen, practising swordsmanship by trying to cut captives in half in one blow. Despite ending Hadendowa resistance, we have only established permanent control of their lands by constructing new outposts in Tokar, Erkowit and Temerein. To the South, the Beni Amer, an unwieldy tribe sandwiched unhappily between the Hadendowa and the Abyssinians, have come to terms with us and begun paying tribute, seeing the enemy of their enemy as their friend. Thus, our line of control has been extended to the banks of the Baraka river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_northernbeja_title;The Subjugation of the Northern Beja;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_northernbeja_desc;The last independent Beja clans remained in and around Salala, in the hilly region of the Nubian Desert. Our army has tried multiple times to build forts in the area, but their resistance and the terrain have made these attempts fail. With them having been increasingly encroached on by our army and their sea access being lost to our control of the coast of the Red Sea, these clans have slowly started to pay tribute in a more consistent way, and have finally let our army build a post near Salala, finishing our conquest of the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
occupy_keren_title;The Occupation of Keren;;;;;;;;;;;;;
occupy_keren_desc;Keren was originally a trading settlement on the Ethiopian frontier, laying on an arid highland plain between the Ansaba and Baraka rivers. The town owes its importance to its position on the trade route between Massawa and Sudan. Typically traded goods include cotton cloth from Sudan and ivory, skins, ostrich feathers and maize from Tigre. While forces have set out from the frontier along the Baraka River and looted Keren and its caravans in the past, our men have now finally permanently occupied it, securing the trade route and logistical connection from Massawa to Kassala for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dallol_seized_title;The Seizure of Dallol;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dallol_seized_desc;Dallol is located in the Danakil Depression, an extremely hot, dry region rich in geothermal activity, possessing multiple volcanoes rich in sulfur. At 100m below sea level, the Awash River flows to multiple hypersaline lakes at the bottom of the depression. As these seasonally dry up, large deposits of salt are revealed. This salt has been mined for centuries and traded via caravans with the rest of Ethiopia, bringing large tax revenues to those controlling the trade. With our position on the Eritrean coast well established and Dallol under the control of weak, disorganized Afar clans, the valuable salt deposits are ours for the taking. Thus, an expedition has set out from our holdings and taken possession of Dallol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_eastern_desert_title;The Conquest of the Eastern Desert;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_eastern_desert_desc;The Eastern Desert is the part of the Sahara desert located east of the Nile river, consisting of a mountain range which runs parallel to the coast, wide sedimentary plateaus extending from either side of the mountains and the Red Sea coast. While the region had been criss-crossed by trade routes during the Roman period, they fell into disuse and the port cities, including Berenice, became ruins. Between the 7th and 19th centuries, the Eastern Desert was virtually abandoned by all but the nomadic Beja. Now, with the construction of the Suez canal, trade has begun to slowly but surely pick up again, leading to the construction of outposts on the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TANGAQUESTION;The coast of the Usambara is rich in trade and cotton, and is the source of the kingdom's richness. Some chiefs that rule to their name are Swahilis that are friendly to our state, and we have good relations with the Kingdom of Usambara, but we might want to get the region for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOBADTANGAJOKESHERE;The coast of the Usambara is rich in trade and cotton, and is the source of our kingdom's richness. Some chiefs that rule to our name there are Swahilis that are friendly to Oman, and they have asked Oman to liberate them. Oman has chosen to ask us first to cede it peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONQUESTPATE;Paté has been in decadence for decades, and its navy and army can't control all of its territory efficiently. With the slave trade reviving and the European colonial powers encroaching in our coasts, we have no choice but to act and centralize our holdings in Zanzibar. Paté, though, is known for its mercenary armies, and its army still has some kind of funding. We could get a treaty ceding only half of their domains to us, in exchange of protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PACTOFEIGHTEENFORTYFOURVLG;The Bond of 1844 is a pact brought forth by the British government in the Gold Coast, specified relationships between the British and the Fante chiefs. The bond would bring us under British protection to Ashanti raids, and bring peace to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bond_of_1844_title;The Bond of 1844;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bond_of_1844_desc;The Fante Confederacy, a state located in the Gold Coast, only survives thanks to our military support. To increase $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in the confederacy, our local administration in the city of Cape Coast has made a proposal to the Fante: We would grant them full protection against the Ashanti Empire in return for significant economic concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEOFWADKALTABUEGY;With our expansion to the south, we started encroaching into Abysinnian territory, and skirmishes started appearing all over the line of contact. Ahmad Kashif wanted to make a punitive expedition against the Abyssinians. With a few troops he went forward and destroyed two villages, being met with resistance but taking a number of captives, among whom was a priest. Kenfu, in secrecy, raised an army to take revenge. With corruption rampant in our rear, incorrect intel arrived to Kashif, who thought that Kenfu's force was small. Khurshid Pasha sent 600 men, amounting to 1500 men counting the local forces. As Ahmad crossed over into Abyssinian territory, Kenfu advanced with an army of 20,000 men, who surrounded Ahmad's force and began attacking from all sides. We've got heavy losses, and we've stopped all encroachments, but we have occupied Gallabat thanks to the chaos of the battle, setting a new border with Gonder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEOFWADKALTABUOVERLORD;With Egypt's expansion to the south, they started encroaching into Abysinnian territory, and skirmishes started appearing all over the line of contact. Ahmad Kashif, an Egyptian official, wanted to lead a punitive expedition against the Abyssinians. With a few troops he went forward and destroyed two villages, being met with resistance but taking a number of captives, among whom was a priest. Gonder ruler Kenfu, in secrecy, raised an army to take revenge. With corruption rampant in their rear, incorrect intel arrived to Kashif, who thought that Kenfu's force was small, less than 3,000 men. Khurshid Pasha sent 600 men, amounting to 1500 men counting the local forces. As Ahmad crossed over into Abyssinian territory, Kenfu advanced with an army of 20,000 men, who surrounded Ahmad's force. They've got heavy losses and have stopped all encroachments, but have occupied Gallabat thanks to the chaos. Egypt has asked us for support against Gonder, as they want to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

conquer_kwavi_title;Conquer the Laikipia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquer_kwavi_desc;The Laikipia peoples live to our north, and are in an inevitable conflict with our kingdom. The Kwavi live in lands that once were part of our kingdom, and occupy them illegaly. We must take their territory and bring them where they belong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAASAIGENOCIDE;'They decided to attack and completely overwhelm the Maasai... With this in view, they went down the Rift Valley, and as they feared being raided by the Maasai whilst they were away, they brought the whole of their stock, women, children and belongings, with them. When the Maasai heard that they were coming, they combined and came forth to meet them. They met the Laikipia north of Nakuru and after a desperate encounter, the Kwavi were gradually pushed backwards in a westerly direction. Not knowing the land, they were unaware that the crater of Menengai, whose wall drops sheer of the plain, was behind them. When near the brink, the Maasai army redoubled the attack, and the Kwavi turned suddenly to fly, and fled over the brink of the crater, those who were not killed by the enemy being precipitated to the bottom.' \nWith our conquest of the Kwavi, the majority of their people have perished in fierce battles. The destruction the war brought to the region would be remembered as the Second Mutai, meaning disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
omani_somalia_title;Claim the Somali Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;
omani_somalia_desc;The coast of the Geledi and Hiraabi has been ruled for centuries by Swahili and Mashriqi people, which act almost independently, some of them even having pacts with us for trade or protection. We should capitalize on these weaknesses and claim the Somali Coast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMANZIMTOTIMAHAA;After diplomats from both sides made pacts of friendship and trade, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ decided to cede us Amanzimtoti. The reason is not certain, but the visible instability of the region and the seeching of protection from the European powers could be reasons that had an impact on the decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HLUBIDEATH;The Hlubi are in a state of chaos. Their inhabitants are under constant threats of massacre by its neighbors, and another scenario like the Mfecane would bring chaos to our region and strenghten the Xhosa, where the Mfecane brought immigration which was used for slavery and strenghtening its army.

GRIQUADEATH;Griqua is in a state of chaos. With precious goods being discovered on their land and the British encroaching into their borders with reasons to fire--greed, they have asked us to settle in Kokstad, where they could survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KLIPDRIFTREPUBLIC;With precious goods being found in Kimberley, a large number of Boer diggers settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the Vaal and Orange rivers. The land where they settled was claimed both by the Griqua, where they frequently herded, and the Orange Boers. Some months ago, Transvaal President Marthinus Wessel Pretorius declared the diamond fields as Boer property and established a temporary government over the diamond fields. The administration of this body was not satisfactory to the Boers, the diggers, the Griqua or the indigenous Tswana. Tension rapidly grew between these parties until Stafford Parker, a former British sailor, organised a faction of the diggers to drive all of the Transvaal officials out of the area. At the settlement of Klipdrift, Stafford Parker declared the independent Klipdrift Republic, who began collecting taxes for the British Empire and asked us to impose our authority. Today, a Committee has been formed which has granted us Kimberley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TURKSEXPULSED;With our deliverance from the Ottoman yoke, a critical moment lies before us concerning the presence of Turks within our nation. As our relations with the Ottoman Empire plummet, tensions rose in Belgrade, where the Ottoman garrison of the Belgrade fortress, one of few remaining vestiges of Turkish control, fired into the city, killing 50 in response to a riot against their presence in the city. This gives us justification to finally rid ourselves of the remaining Turks living in our country and expel them from our lands. They may have done nothing wrong, but this is seen as a necessary step towards achieving full independence from the Ottoman oppressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TURKSEXPULSEDOPT;Another step towards the total liberation of Serbia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALBANIANSEXPULSED;With the acquisition of parts of Southern Serbia and the conclusion of the last conflict our nation was embroiled in, a question has arisen concerning the Albanian population of the recently acquired territories. Many Albanians already fled when our troops arrived to besiege major cities like Niš, where the Albanian quarter was burned when the city surrendered. Mosques were destroyed in Vranje, Leskovac and Prokuplje. In the hilly villages, whilst some fled, leaving behind their livestock and property, many local Albanians defended their villages and resisted our advances. Others abandoned their villages and headed to the mountains where they began employing guerrilla tactics against our army, though they were eventually driven out. We have decided to remove the potential fifth column in our newly conquered lands, expelling all remaining Albanians from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALBANIANSEXPULSEDOPT;The ethnic cleansing is complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1927GULANGEARTHQUAKE;On May 22nd, an extreme earthquake struck central Kansu, killing 40,912 people, hundreds of thousands of domestic animals, and destroying large swathes of the region. \n\nThe epicenter of the earthquake was near Gulang, an agricultural town by the Northern Silk Road, though the earthquake was felt as far as 700km away. In Gulang, almost the only thing left standing was a 20m long section of the city walls and some decorated archways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1925SANTABARBARAEARTHQUAKE;On June 29th, a violent earthquake struck southern California, causing 13 deaths and 8,000,000 dollars in damages. \n\nThe earthquake occurred at 6:44 AM, with the epicenter being located at the coastal city of Santa Barbara. Though much of Santa Barbara was destroyed, further disaster was prevented by the heroic actions of three citizens, who shut off the town gas and electricity, preventing a catastrophic fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1935QUETTAEARTHQUAKE;On May 31st, an extreme earthquake struck East Pashtunistan, causing between 30,000 to 60,000 deaths. \n\nThe epicenter of the earthquake was near Quetta, a major city high in the Baluchistani mountains. Much of the city was destroyed, with the infrastructure almost entirely in ruins. Tens of thousands were trapped under rubble, and countless corpses were found lying in the hot sun. All villages between Quetta and Kalat were destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1935HELENAEARTHQUAKE;Starting October 18th, a series of severe earthquake struck south-western Montana, causing 4 deaths and 3,000,000 dollars in damages. They began on the 18th at 10:48 PM,  with the epicenter being located near Helena, Montana's capital city. \n\nThe earthquakes displaced some 400 people. Most found space with friends or family outside of the damaged area by the end of the week. Many others lived in tents around the town for the next few weeks, either due to damaged property or for fear of aftershocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1842GREVIANCES;The Bukhara, as menacing as they are, have launched a war against us to take Khojent and weaken our state irreparably. Their Emir, Nasrullah Khan, has ordered the execution of Ali-Khan and Nodira of Kokand, and march their troops onto our lands, crossing the mountain chains. At the same time, the Kyrgyz, which we finally finished conquering in 1830, have now revolted against our rule. Ormon Khan has been declareed the Khan of a new Kyrgyz Khanate, and have started destroying our forts in Naryn and Bishkek. The Kurtka Fortress is the most important one, now being in siege. We hope for the best, but our future as a regional power is dwindling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENIORZHUZ;With the fall of the Middle Jüz, the remaining parts of the Kazakh Khanate, the Senior Jüz fell into decadence and wars with the Kyrgyz of the South, weakening further and becoming a great target for expansion. With this opportunity, we must prepare for a quick war to end the sovereignty of the Kazakh Jüzes once and for all, and while we're at it, we could get some Kyrgyz land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1886CHARLESTONEARTHQUAKE;On August 21st, an extreme earthquake struck the coast of South Carolina, causing 60 deaths and up to 6,000,000 dollars in damages. \n\nThe initial shock in Charleston lasted 45 seconds and was extremely destructive, leaving nearly all of the city with either interior damage or broken windows. The first aftershock followed minutes later, and had the city rumbling once again. In the next day, at least seven different aftershocks were felt in Charleston and its surrounding areas. The damage stretched out in a radius of a hundred miles. The quake was felt in cities as far as Boston and Chicago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

nejd_free_desc;The Egyptians have had a presence in our country for more than 10 years, it being more accentuated in Ha'il, to the Egyptians we owe our presence there not being enough  to centralize the region. With the Egyptian troops weak and trapped in Yemen and the Ottoman Empire in disarray, we should try stopping to pay tribute to the Egyptians and free ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEJDNOTPAYTRIBUTE;The Nejd today have refused to continue the payment of vassalage, as they deem that we are weak enough for them to defend against any punitive expedition from Cairo. We should prove them wrong and continue our dominance over the Arabian Peninsula!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INTERVENTIONSEQUEL;The Nejd have capitulated and returned to their state of vassaldom, paying their tribute to our great state. Our domains in the Arabian peninsula are again stable and should never fall again. With this in mind, we could try centralizing the states in the region under our rule, but that could be seen as an act of aggression from the Ottomans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INTERVENTIONSEQUELLESGO;The Egyptians have finally left our lands for Cairo, and we are free from vassalage. With our newfound freedom, we could annex our neighboring states, but that could be seen as an act of aggression from the Ottomans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALMIRFA;For now decades, we have had influence and owned parts of the region to our west, the biggest city there being al-Mirfa, which ruler is our ally and has asked us for annexation more than once. In 1835, a section of the Bani Yas that had committed piracy against the British, trying to escape the consequences of their acts, had seceded from our state and settled in Odeid, near the Qatari border. With the news arriving to the British embassy, the local rulers of southern Qatar were prohibited from supplying the pirates, and set fire to some of the pirates' boats. After receiving approval from the British some days ago, we sent troops to occupy the region and sack their settlement, centralizing the region under our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEDHANK;The Imam of Oman has gained influence of power over the last years, having fought a war against the Nejd and gaining positive relations with Abu Dhabi. He has made a campaign to gain followers and allies to centralize Oman under his rule, but they aren't powerful enough to beat us. With troops amounting just outside the city of Dhank, a bloody battle is on the horizon. Should we escalate further and unite Oman and Muscat or back down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOLAMASTART;A dispute over Bolama has turned into an all-out crisis in the last days, with British and Portuguese ships facing each other without firing on the Bolama Coast. In 1792, a group of officers of the Royal Navy led an attempt to resettle Black former slaves from the Americas on the island of Bolama off the coast of Portuguese Guinea. Most of the settlers died and the survivors abandoned the colony in November 1793 and made their way to Settler Town in what later became Sierra Leone. In 1830 we started officially claiming the island, and a dispute developed. In the last years though, the British have had increasingly more influence on the island, and have claimed to have annexed the island. What should we do to end this crisis?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOLAMAFAVORESUS;Bolama has been disputed for more than 40 years now, and an arbitration by Ulysses Grant has settled the crisis. The islands will now be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

VERGONHADESC;After our decision to enact laws that prohibit the usage of patois, or non-French languages in schools, usage of humiliation and corporal punishments have become prevalent against children by their teachers. Clogging has become standard practice in our schools, with offenders having to wear objects such as clogs around their necks. Another example of suppression is our administration's usage of "la Vergonha" or "the shame" in order to alienate Occitan speakers from their own language, by painting it as a corrupted form of French, used by the ignorant and uneducated lower classes. In order to replace the languages of our minority groups with French, our prefects and sub-prefects have been instructed to focus on the annihilation of non-French languages. Although these practices have begun to show results, one cannot deny the inhumane nature of our new schooling systems, and it brings shame to the French system in its entirety. Still, there are many who support these practices, however, one cannot begin to wonder whether this will be seen as an act of unification- or a shameful system desperate to facilitate control over its subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NGONIMARAVI;Our Confederation is in disarray. 20 years ago, we had to leave our capital in Mankhamba due to internal disputes for the throne of the Maravi and the Chewa, and the city and its surroundings have fallen into disuse, with nomadic tribes taking over the region. Now, with the Ngoni taking over our Chewa neighbor in Mkamanga (which once was ours), they have now started raiding our borderlands, and even taken over part of our land and Mankhamba, which we also claim as ours.

found_mankanba_title;Re-found Mankhamba;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
found_mankanba_desc;The Maravi operated a decentralised political system. With time, the system isolated and weakened the Kalonga, who often had no dependable relations locally. Sometime during the eighteenth century, perhaps due to the growing influence of the Banda clan, the requirement that Undi nominate Kalonga’s successors was no longer enforced which meant that counsellors of the Banda clan at Mankhamba assumed that responsibility. On the surface, it seemed sensible to appoint successors locally. After all, that was how they did it before Undi and Nyangu left. However, times had changed, and this time it did not work smoothly. Its decline there would not have meant much had Mankhamba not been the capital of the Maravi. In this case it did, because it shows that the pottery went into disuse at the site soon after its introduction, an indication that Kalonga and his people abandoned Mankhamba at about that time.

maravi_reclaim_desc;Throughout the eighteenth century, a growing state of instability characterised the political situation in the Maravi empire. As territorial chiefs became increasingly independent, Kalonga’s grip on power and trade became weak. Other ethnic groups were quick to notice that weakness and they took advantage of it. The best known of those ethnic groups were the Yao in northern Mozambique who developed their own trade routes in the region. They became so successful that, by the 1740s, Portuguese merchants along the Indian Ocean coast recognised them as major traders and some foreign merchants encouraged them to trade in slaves as well. With the decadence of the Maravi, they themselves became the slaves that started to be traded by the Yao int he slave markets of Kilwa and Zanzibar, and with the Portuguese until 1833. We should recover the control over the trades that are conducted throughout the region and reform the Maravi to its greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HATT_I_SHARIF_1833;In 1830, we were forced to pass a Hatt-i-Sharif, i.e. an imperial edict that granted Serbia far-reaching autonomy, sold all Turkish-held property therein and recognized Prince Miloš Obrenovic's right to form a dynasty. These humiliating demands were all part of the Treaty of Adrianople, signed after losing the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29. We have, however, by stalling negotiations, avoided the treaty's worst part: Ceding 6 nahiyas on the Principality of Serbia's southern border to the Serbs. Now, Russia has put its foot down and threatened war if we continue to delay. Sadly, with our empire in the state that it is, we have little choice in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SERHATTSHARIF33;The Ottomans have ceded us 6 nahiyas on our southern border, fulfilling their final obligations as per the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople, which followed the Russo-Turkish War that had begun a year prior. These areas were controlled by noble Serbian freedom fighters during the war of independence but were retaken by the Turks shortly after. Now, thanks to the efforts of our Russian compatriots, our rightful territories have finally been returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EMIRATEMECHANIC;This update has a new mechanic for Emirates under the Sokoto Caliphate, the Autonomous Emirate mechanic. Gwandu - when formed by Sokoto and given its autonomy -, Adamawa - if Sokoto gives it more autonomy later on - and Ilorin will be allied to Sokoto for as long as they exist, until they are annexed, or until they have -190 relations with Sokoto and leave their alliance. If you are an Autonomous Emirate, you can stop being so, getting an event if you drop relatios under -190 and you leave your alliance - you though have to be fast, in a month you are allied again, so make sure to make leaving the alliance the last thing you do or relations will bump back with the alliance is added back. Your modifier will dissapear when you do so -. The modifier they have when they are Autonomous Emirates lets them always declare for cores, and if Sokoto refuses to help in a war this won't remove the Emirate condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAUWALADAMADEATH;Today our great Lamido, Lauwal bin Adama has died of disease. This is leading us to a succession crisis, as the new Lamido could be 2 people as for the succession principles: Hamidu, a warlord from Gurin which has part of the economy under him and has clients in Yola, and Sanda, half-brother of Lauwal, with the majority of the malams of Yola and the House of Alkassum, house of Adama's son-in-law. Though, there is an issue which divides public opinion, the malams have advocated for an end to the jihad for now some years. With this mounting, both candidates have sent letters to Sokoto to be handed the flag and become the Lamido. The opinion of the Caliph might weaken our state irrevocably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADAMAWALAMIDO;The Lamido of Adamawa, Lauwal bin Adama, has died today due to disease, and the Adamawan lamidos have not been able to find a sole successor, having two valid options. The Sandites want us to have further control over them but want an end to the Jihad, and the Hamidites want to keep their current position and continue with the Jihad. The solution, though, isn't that easy: Hamidu holds a lot of power and might revolt anytime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANDALAMIDO;Sokoto has decided to give the flag to Sanda bin Lamido, half-brother of Lauwal and the chosen successor by Adama. It might seem like a good decision, but the Hamidites have prepared a revolt and hold a lot of power, and with them basically holding Yola hostage, they have declared independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAMIDULAMIDO;Sokoto has decided to give the flag to Hamidu, lamido of Gurin, for his work in the jihad. The army, though, is with Sanda and refuses Sokoto's decision. They are in Yola, keeping the capital under their control, and Hamidu's forces, which outnumber them in guns, have surrounded the city. Fearing a civil war has already started, Hamidu has sent messages to Yola to capitulate. He has given them 7 days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YOLAADAMAWABATTLE;The seven days have passed, and this morning Hamidu's forces have encountered Hamidu dead of unknown causes. They are putting down their arms and moving back to Hibango, near to Gurin. We shall send a letter to Sokoto so they can give the flag to his successor, Sanda bin Adama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAMIDUDEADHOW;After we gave the flag to Hamidu, Sanda's forces kept the capital, Yola, and the Hamidites mounted a siege for 7 days, with an ultimatum that in the eight day they'd assault the city with superior numbers. In the seventh day, Hamidu was found dead in the outskirts of Yola, with no known causes. Some Hamidites say it might have been an assassination, but most of them have laid down their arms and declared Sanda bin Adama as their successor. Must we give the flag to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MANDARAMECHANIC;This update has a new mechanic for states under Kanem-Bornu, the Affiliated State mechanic. Mandara will be allied to Kanem-Bornu for as long as they exist, until they are annexed, or until they have -190 relations with Kanem-Bornu and leave their alliance. If you are an Affiliated State, you can stop being so, getting an event if you drop relatios under -190 and you leave your alliance - you though have to be fast, in a month you are allied again, so make sure to make leaving the alliance the last thing you do or relations will bump back with the alliance is added back. Your modifier will dissapear when you do so -.

Usman had prophesied that the caliphate's reign would last only until the arrival of the Mahdi, within a span of a hundred years. Sultan Bello (second Sultan of Sokoto) further requested Adama to send spies to "south of Wadai and the south of Fur in the direction of the Nile River" so that the people of the caliphate, on the Mahdi's appearance, could "follow him and give him the oath of allegiance.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

FASHODAINCIDENT;An incident has occurred in Fashoda, Sudan, in which our expeditionary force led by Jean-Baptiste Marchand and its 130 soldiers, searching to occupy Sudan and claim control over a coast-to-coast colonial holding in Africa, has met in Fashoda another expeditionary army, first thought to be Dervish but later known to be British, led by Herbert Kitchener, which had just defeated the Mahdists in a battle near Khartoum, and was under constant guerrilla warfare attacks. Both forces in Fashoda have insisted on their right to control Fashoda but have agreed to wait for further instructions from their mainlands, jointly occupying the city. The British camp, though, distributed propaganda detailing how we aren't able to help Fashoda. Any battle produced there would clearly be suicidal, but ceding to the British would be a national humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

kilwa_empire_angoche_desc;We had been part of the Kilwa Empire, and our lands became very wealthy thanks to newfound trade routes from the interior of the continent, bringing ivory and slaves.

GHUMAONE;The rulers of Fezzan have been at war against our local rulers in Tarabulus ever since we reinstated our rule in the region and overthrew the Tripolitanian dynasties. They claim to have an embassy with France, and they get arms from an unknown trade network. All we know is that they are a thorn in our side, and they should be brought back to Ottoman direct rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GHUMALAST;Ghuma al-Mahmudi has kept his control over Qaryat ever since we took over the Tripolitanian region of Fezzan, mantaining control with a sort of guerrilla warfare that reminds of the Peninsular War. Our local army has struggled to mantaim control over the cities and oasis bordering his zone of control, but division in his ranks has made it easier to start regaining control. He was exiled in the 1840s after the defeat of his armies, but with British help he has been able to return to Djebel Gharbi and organized another resistance movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SENUSSICREATION;Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi was born in Algeria near Mostaganem and was named al-Senussi after a venerated Muslim teacher. He was a member of the Walad Sidi Abdalla tribe, and was a sharif. Al-Senussi was critical of the government of Muhammad Ali Pasha. He argued that learned Muslims should not blindly follow the four classical madhhabs (schools of law) but instead engage in ijtihad themselves. Senussi went to Mecca, where he joined Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi, the head of the Qadiriyya, a renowned religious fraternity. On the death of al-Fasi, Senussi became head of one of the two branches into which the Qadiriyya divided, and in 1835 he founded his first monastery or zawiya, at Abu Qubays near Mecca. After being forced to leave by the Wahhabis he has returned to Libya, where he has founded places of teaching, where he teaches his believes under a new religious fraternity, the Senussiya. They have grown in political power, and control swathes of desert in Cyrenaica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BLOODTAXDESC;As part of the government's efforts to modernize Japan, mandatory military conscription for all male citizens was recently introduced, which has come to be known as a "blood tax" among the peasantry.  Incited by this unpopular policy, as well as anger at the emancipation of the Burakumin minority and the institution of mandatory public schooling, hundreds of thousands of peasant farmers and rural samurai have risen up in rebellion. The revolt has spread across ten prefectures, including Kyoto, Okayama, Fukui, Mie, Tottori, Hiroshima, Shimane, Kagawa, Ehime, and Kochi. Government offices, police stations, newly established public schools, and the homes of government officials and newly emancipated Burakumin are being looted and destroyed en masse by the angry rabble. They have armed themselves with bamboo spears, guns, and swords, easily overwhelming the outnumbered local police.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HATTISHARIFEIGHTEENTHIRTY;After the Russian Empire utterly defeated us in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29, they forced us to sign the Treaty of Adrianople. It includes several provisions concerning Serbia, including granting the Serbs freedom of movement throughout our empire, confirming their privileges within their principality, ceding 6 nahijas to it, selling all Turkish-owned property located in it to Serbs and allowing Prince Miloš Obrenovic to form a dynasty. Originally, the Russians demanded that we fulfill their demands a month after the treaty, but so far we have been able to successfully stall negotiations. Now, their patience has worn out: While we can delay the cession of territory to the Principality of Serbia for a few more years, if we do not grant Serbia autonomy and implement the other demands immediately, Russia may declare war. Though it would be madness after our previous defeat, some advisors are advocating for an attempt to reconquer Serbia, whatever the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SERGETSINVADED;In 1829, Sultan Mahmud II signed the Treaty of Adrianople after being defeated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29. Its provisions included granting us further autonomy and ceding us territory to our South. The dastardly Turks have, however, continually stalled for time and refused to submit to Russia's demands. Now, they have played their true hand: The Ottoman Empire has launched a surprise attack, renouncing the Treaty of Adrianople entirely and aiming to reconquer our principality. While Russian aid is surely on the way, we must brace ourselves for what will hopefully be our third and final war of independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSHELPSSER;In 1829, Sultan Mahmud II signed the Treaty of Adrianople after being defeated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29. Our demands included increasing the autonomy of Serbia as well as ceding it more territory. Since the signing of the treaty, the Turks have dragged their feet and avoided fulfilling the treaty's obligations. Now, their secret motivation has been revealed: They were planning to invade the Principality of Serbia all along! If we do not intervene on Prince Miloš Obrenovic's side, this may spell the end for the Serbians and destroy our international reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SERHATTSHARIFSTART;When our savior, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia resoundingly defeated the tyrant Sultan Mahmud II in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29, he forced the Turks to sign the Treaty of Adrianople. Its demands included giving our people freedom of movement throughout the Ottoman Empire, confirming our privileges, being ceded 6 nahijas to the South, forcing the Turks to sell all property in our principality to us and allowing Prince Miloš Obrenovic to form a dynasty. After the perfidious Ottomans delayed negotiations for months, Russia has finally put its foot down and forced them to accept all demands save for the border adjustments, which require further discussion. Though we are still nominally subservient to the Sultan, the Principality of Serbia is now functionally independent thanks to the efforts of our Russian benefactors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MABADIAKHOUBA;A descendant of the Fulani Denianke Dynasty, Maba was born in 1809 a member of the Bâ family of the region of Rip, also known as Badibou. His grandfather had immigrated from Futa Toro, and the family were all teachers of the Quran. Maba studied in Cayor and taught in Kingdom of Jolof, where he married a member of the royal family, then returned to Rip around 1850. The local ruler of Badibou (Rip) in the 1850s was Mansa Jeriba. He was a weak ruler, and his warriors would frequently raid marabout villages in the area. Maba was the court marabout, frequently making amulets and praying for the king, but also attempting to weaken him by magical means and stockpiling weaponry. When the local ruler launched a new campaign of raids and the Marabouts retaliated he tried to crush the resistance, but Maba and his students defeated him. This success attracted more supporters, and he has been able to gain control over Eastern Saloum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SOMALILANDEXPEDITION;Last May, Richard Francis Burton, the most documented non-Muslim European to make the Hajj, supported by the Royal Geographical Society, travelled to Aden in preparation for his expedition to Somaliland. His first stop was at Zayla, where he met the local Egyptian ruler, Sharmakay bin Ali Salih. Disguised as an Arab merchant, he awaited word that the road to Harar was safe. In Sagharrah, in the path to Harar, he openly proclaimed to be an English officer. According to Burton, "A tradition exists that with the entrance of the first [white] Christian, Harar will fall." With Burton's entry, the "Guardian Spell" was broken. He was graciously met by the Harari Amir, officially a guest of the Amir but in reality his prisoner. He's already walking the path to the coast, in Berbera, where he wants to prepare to set out in search of the source of the Nile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BERBERACOMES;When Burton arrived to Berbera, Burton prepared to set out in search of the source of the Nile, accompanied by Lieutenant Speke, Lieutenant G. E. Herne and Lieutenant William Stroyan and a number of Africans employed as bearers and expedition guides. The schooner HCS Mahi delivered them to Berbera on 7 April. Yesterday, Burton's camp was encountered by three horsemen, one Mohammed of the ‘Isa Musa, and another Dublay of the Ayal Ahmed, the third unknown. Burton's camp had mistaken them for a foraging party and quickly discharged above the horsemen. Today, his party has been attacked by a group of Isaaqi warriors, numbering about 200. Stroyan has been killed, Speke has been wounded in 11 places before his scape and Burton has been impaled with a javelin, the point entering one cheek and exiting the other. He has escaped with the weapon still transfixing his head. Rumours have reached us that the Senussi Order might have a hand in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BARBARAMAN;Richard Francis Burton, a British officer, has been for the past year in an expedition throughout Somaliland, from Zayla to Harar. Some days ago he arrived to Barbara, where he was preparing for an expedition to the African Great Lakes. Yesterday, Burton's camp was encountered by three horsemen of our royalty. Burton's camp had mistaken them for a foraging party and quickly discharged above them. Today, his party has been attacked by a group of our warriors, numbering about 200. Burton has been impaled with a javelin, the point entering one cheek and exiting the other. He has escaped with the weapon still transfixing his head. This has lead to a diplomatic crisis with the British, whom have implemented a blockade on our ports, crippling our economy. They ask for the surrendering of the three horseman who, in their perspective, were "spying" on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BARBARAYES;The British Empire has won once again. The Habr Awal of Berbera, at first deemed it ironic. Due to the Habr Awal believing the blockade would not only suffer the trade in Berbera, but also in Aden. However they were mistaken, since the trade allegedly found an outlet on different locations. The Sheikhs of the Isaaq have surrendered the assailants implicated in the murder of Stroyan, and the blockade has ended following a treaty that secures our commercial interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now that we have secured a route for our resources and armies to be sent to Algeria, we can start helping them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATOTTOMANSAVIOURS;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed an alliance between our states in defence of the French. They will send troops to the region, in exchange of us becoming their protectorate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATOTTOMANSAVIOURSTUR;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted that we send troops into their territory to defend them. We must now start preparing for a war against the French, as they will most likely not accept our 'encroachment into their internal policies'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATOTTOMANSAVIOURSTURNO;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has rejected our calls for an unified response to the French. They argue that we are who caused the issue in the first place, as in the aftermath of the first war against the French our local garrison raided local towns and had to be expelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAWGOTTOSWHATYADOIN;The Ottomans have started a diplomatic mission to Algiers, supporting the local militias and raiding our local colonies. They are clearly encroaching on our divine right to civilize Algeria, and we must stop them at any cost. We might have to consider another war against the Ottomans, or our colony might fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WENEEDHELLPALGERIA;The French have sent us an Ultimatum - stop supporting the 'rebellious Algerine provinces', or face consequences. This is a clear attack towards our move to help Algeria remain independent, and we must act in consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TURIGNORESULTIMATUMFRA;The Ottomans have refused to acknowledge our right to Algeria, and have deemed us 'just another colonialist state'. These insults can only be an invitation to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_to_the_desert_title;The Expansion to the Desert;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_to_the_desert_desc;The Libyan Desert has numerous oasis, and has been used for centuries to trade with the Sahel, to the other side of the Sahara. We have influence over most of the oasis in the desert and we might be able to take over their administration, as most of the trade routes there begin in our territory, and the word of Senussi has been heard to the other side of the desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SULTANATEYUNISHABR;The Habr Yunis are a branch of the Isaaq clan, who live in the West of our lands. They have been a vassal of our state for a century, but with the death of our Sultan, Faarax Guuleed, they and other western clans have broken off and put Berbera in siege. They have support from the Emirate of Harar, and will stop the siege if we let them be independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SULTANATEYUNISHABRHAR;The Habr Yunis are a branch of the Isaaq clan, who live in the West of the Isaaq Sultanate. They have been a vassal of the Isaaq for a century, but with the death of their sultan, Faarax Guuleed, they and other western clans have broken off and put Berbera in siege. Isaaq suspects we're supporting them, and have declared war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
take_over_claims_cyr_title;Claim Our Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
take_over_claims_cyr_desc;Our zawiyas, or monasteries, extend all around the Western Arab World. The ones in the Central Sahara and Libya, though, are becoming more and more economical, educational, and military centers, with buildings teaching tactics, fighting skills and using muskets. We may control parts of the Desert between Tobruk and Waddai, that's not where our influence ends. We could use this to our advantage, and unite the Central Sahara against the foreign powers of the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENUSSIALGERIA;The Senussi have started occupying part of our Southern Territories in spite of our clear prohibition of such act. They seem to ignore our ultimatums, and are fortifying all borders to the North. As we are the only protectors of Algeria, we must send them an Ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHULTIMATUM;The French have sent us an Ultimatum - leave what they consider to be the 'Algerian Southern Territories', or face consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHULTIMATUMNO;The Senussi have refused to give in to our demands, and have continued fortifying their positions. The only way to be heard now is to go to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENUSSIUNITE;The Senussi are expanding their influence around the Central Sahara, and have asked $FROMCOUNTRY$, who have accepted. They were our vassals, and so they can't just give up their territory to another nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MORETRIPOLITANIAPLEASE;The Senussi have asked to administer Tripolitania for us, as they have extreme influence on the region thanks to their zawiyas, or monasteries, which hold economical, educational and military centers. Our local garrison is smaller in number than their militias in our territory, not counting the Senussi's actual army. We might want to give in, or the war could be a humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOEMFONTEINFOUNDATION;Today, the city of Bloemfontein has been founded near Brits' Farm, in the site of a former Barolong Tswana and !Orana Khoekhoe town. The founder is a British Army major named Henry Douglas Warden, who has founded it to fight the !Orana and Barolong resistance to Boer and British rule, and to protect the main route to Winburg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EFONJIHAD;The Efon have been supporting Oyo in the Jihad, which has undermined our holy war in the region. We should probably launch a Jihad in the region, as their alliance to Benin isn't enough to stop us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NKHOTAKHOTACONQUEST;With our recent defeats against rebels in our territory, we've been forced to leave what we thought would be our new homeland. We though have been able to take over Lundazi and successfully create a state in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JUMBECOMETH;Salim bin Abdallah arrived at Nkhotakota around 1840. He is an Arab from Zanzibar, and had traded in Ujiji and Tabora beforehand. He bought some land near Nkhotakota to establish a trading post. He has grown rich thanks to the slave trade, and with his ownership of the newest arms known in the region he has been able to face off our attacks to his post for them to pay taxes. Lately though the Jumbes have started occupying the northern coast of Lake Malawi, Nkhotakota having fallen today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MODIBBOADAMA;Modibbo Adama, our great emir, has died today in $CAPITAL$. He was born in 1779 in Wuro Chekke, and recieved Muslim religious education until he was eleven years old. When he returned from Baguirmi from studying the Quran, he learned that his father had died in local clashes between the Fulbe and Bata communities. He joined the Ba'en Fulbe and defended the Fulbe in the Faro valley, until Usman dan Fodio's jihad starrted in 1804. In 1809, with Sokoto's influence nearing Fombina, the Fulbe of the region met in Guringa and decided to join their jihad, and a delegation was sent to Sokoto with Adama at its head. Usman appointed him as Lamido Fombina, and asked them to launch jihad in the region. The jihads were succesful, and the state we know today is the surviving legacy of his great reign. Muhammadu Lawal will succeed him, and our jihad continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FAMINESMAHDISTS;The war for the Mahdi State's survival has dragged for far too long, and our hold on the borderly provinces has broken down slowly but steadily. Some of them were crucial for our agricultural supply, and food shortages have become brutal and widespread. Most supplies arriving to our cities have been redirected to the war effort, and the situation has descended into a famine. Our government has been unable to respond to this disaster and it has even strained it further. The Khalifa has purged numerous tribes for disloyalty to genocidal levels, one of them being the grain-farming Juhaina tribe, and last month a drought to the south of our core territory broke entirely any hopes of recovery. Millions have died due to this, and our condition in the war has been greatly weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COLONYNATALANNEX;Not a long time ago, we managed to take over Natalia and establish our own colonial administration in the name of the Colony of Natal. The colony, though it makes sense to be separate as for its distance from the Cape, is being a burden to our finances and isn't bringing enough returns to be worth it. Should we cede the Colony of Natal to the Cape Colony, or continue to administrate it separately?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COLONYNATALREINSTATE;With a considerable increase on the number of settlers in the former Colony of Natalia, it has become profitable to run a new colonial administration in Natal, separate from the Cape Colony. Doing so should help the colony instate laws that benefit it, and increase revenue further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KLIPRIVERREPUBLIC;With the British Colony of Natal becoming more and more of a menace to our sovereignty, a Boer named Andreas Theodorus Spies has proposed that we sell to them all lands to the other side of the Buffalo River, namely Emnambithi. We should consider this opportunity to create an alliance with the Boers against the British, as it is clear that they want to end our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UTRECHTREPUBLIEK;After the Klip River Republic was occupied, the majority of the settlers escaped to what would become the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republics, but three of them – A. T. Spies, J. C. Klopper and C. J. van Rooyen – managed to buy land east of the Buffalo River from Zulu King Mpande. Van Rooyen spoke Zulu fluently, and was a friend of the king, so they mantained the rights over the land. The majority of the North of Zululand is intermittently uninhabited since the Hlubi fled to Mpondo, but there were some Zulu towns. Our government has refused to annex it for some years so they didn't antagonize the British, now neighbours through the territory of the once independent Klip River Republic, but we might want to reconsider this stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UTRECHTREPUBLIEKZUL;After the Klip River Republic was occupied, the majority of the settlers escaped to what would become the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republics, but three of them – A. T. Spies, J. C. Klopper and C. J. van Rooyen – managed to buy land east of the Buffalo River from our great king, Mpande. Van Rooyen spoke Zulu fluently and was a friend of the king, so they mantained the rights over the land. The majority of the Northern Territories is intermittently uninhabited since the Hlubi fled to Mpondo, but there still are some Zulu towns. Today the settlers have taken over parts of the Northern Territories, and been annexed into Transvaal as the Province of Utrecht. Shall we stop claiming the territory or launch a campaign to recover it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRANSVAALCIVILNOWAR;A series of skirmishes have happened all around our territories, between militias aligned with Paul Kruger and with Stephanus Schoeman, on disputes over the constitution and worries that Britain could declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void. After a battle in Potchefstroom, Paul Kruger has won and an armistice has been declared, effectively ending all violence between the two factions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRANSVAALCIVILWAR;A series of skirmishes have started to happen all around our territories, especially in the Northern Provinces. These are between militias aligned with Paul Kruger and with Stephanus Schoeman, on disputes over the constitution and worries that Britain could declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void. Battles have started in Potchefstroom, and a civil war has effectively started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRANSVAALCIVILWARHLB;The current president of the Transvaal, Paul Kruger, has silenced our voice at the Volksraad and started mobilizing their army against us and the Orange Free State. With our borders becoming more and more unstable, we might want to start a war ourselves to stop Transvaal from becoming too authoritarian. Lydenburg will join us if we do so, and if we win we might unite in a new, reformed Boer state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRANSVAALCIVILWARTRN;A series of skirmishes have started to happen all around our territories, especially in Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg. These are between militias aligned with Paul Kruger and with Stephanus Schoeman, on disputes over the constitution and worries that Britain could declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void. Battles have started in Potchefstroom, and a civil war has effectively started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lydenburg_occupy_title;Claim Lydenburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lydenburg_occupy_desc;The Trekkers had founded a town named Ohrigstad in the heart of baPedi territory, isolated from Potchefstroom or Zoutpansberg. The town failed due to a malaria epidemic, but Lydenburg was founded some tens of kilometers to the South by the same settlers the next year. The baPedi have become more and more distrustful about the expanding control of the Boers over the region, and it has started fortifying the neighboring lands, almost encircling the town. The settlers have asked our militias for help, but a war against baPedi wouldn't be beneficial to our economy. We could pact with them so they cede the region to us for §R50,000¤§!, but if we do not gather these pounds we will have to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SELLLYDENBURGPCF;The Boers had founded a town named Ohrigstad in our territory known as Mashishing, but it declined due to a malaria epidemic. They then marched south, where the malaria epidemic hadn't spread, and founded the town of Lydenburg. Our local rulers have tried to fortify their positions and don't let any help arrive from Potchefstroom, but they failed to stop a messenger from escaping and now the Boers know Lydenburg is at its breaking point. The Boers, though armed enough to start a war that would cripple our economy, have decided to trade Lydenburg and the surrounding territories for §G50,000¤§! and the newest arms known to them. Should we accept, though, we'd lose one of the most populous areas of our kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_bapedi_title;Claim the baPedi and Venda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_bapedi_desc;The baPedi and Venda have for centuries lived in the Drakensberg Mountains and the Lowveld, Bushveld and Highveld, but with our arrival to their territory some have escaped to the Drakensberg, where they reorganized and from where they launch raids into our territories. To pacify our borderlands, we'll need to claim the Drakensberg Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_zanzibar_title;Form Zanzibar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_zanzibar_desc;Zanzibar has been under Oman for far too long. The Mazrui have strived to unite the coast under its people, and with the final conquest of the last holdouts we can now proudly say we not only claim Zanzibar, we now are Zanzibar. Long live the Zanzibari Coast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
occupy_kilwa_title;Occupy Kilwa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
occupy_kilwa_desc;The Kilwa Coast is controlled by different coastal tribes, from the Zaramo to the local Swahili. They are unorganized and they rule in a decentralized manner, not correctly controlling the region. With the European powers encroaching on the continent, Kilwa is an easy prey for us, but also the other colonial powers. We should occupy the city and its surroundings, as the holders of Zanzibar and Sudi have claimed it since time immemorial and we already hold influence in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZIGUAREBELLION;Today a slave rebellion has started in the islands of Zanzibar and nearby Pemba, led by a gang of Zigua slaves, who were cheaply bought during a famine. They have now withdrewn into the jungle, where they are being joined by other fugitives and malcontents from the neighbouring towns and plantations. They are too numerous to stop with the troops stationed in Africa, but we must act or they will escape, or worse, we could lose control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TOTALVICTORYOMAN;After days of battles in the jungles of the Zanzibar Islands, we have been able to stop the Zigua Slave Rebellion, and returned peace to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PHYRRICVICTORYOMAN;Our resources haven't been enough to fully stop the revolt, and some of the slaves have been able to escape to the continent, where now they are free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PHYRRICDEFEATOMAN;Our resources haven't been enough to stop the revolt entirely, and the majority of the slaves that joined the rebellion have been able to escape to the continent, where now they are free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OMANHOWCOULDYOU;Our resources have been very limited in relative terms to the rebellion, which has grown too big for our own control over the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OMANHOWTHEZIGUA;The escaped slaves from the Zanzibar Islands have reached an alliance with local rulers, between them the Mazrui, and have decided to launch an all-out rebellion against us. One would think this alliance would be weak, but centuries of rule in Zanzibar has led to lots of discontent in the Swahili aristocracy, and they have sold arms to the Zigua for their continued rebellion under their flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAZRUIWHYTHE;There has been a slave revolt in Zanzibar, and in the resulting chaos the majority of the island's slave Zigua population has managed to escape to the continent, where they are waging a guerrilla war. If we help them in their rebellion, we might be able to gain control over the whole of the Zanzibari Coast, expulsing the Omanis once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZIGUAAGAINSTSHAMBAA;The Zigua revolted some years ago in Zanzibar, where they were slaves, and escaped to the continent where they have founded numerous chiefdoms. Korogwe has slowly been settled by Ziguas, and our western borders are already under Zigua control. Today, the bordering Zigua chiefdoms have allied and taken over the Pangani Valley, and we've lost control over Korogwe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUNGIQUESTION;The Tungi Sultanate is the southernmost sultanate that is part of the Zanzibar Kilwa Governorate. They are basically independent, but they depend on their overlords for foreign policy and defence. We've managed to sign treaties with the ruler of Tungi to protect them ourselves, but the rulers at Zanzibar won't accept this fact. Should we negotiate or fully take it over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUNGIQUESTIONZAN;The Tungi Sultanate is the southernmost sultanate that is part of our state in Cabo Delgado. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed treaties with the rulers of Tungi, and they now consider themselves their protectors. Should we cede them Tungi to not cause any problems or try to let the issue die down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUNGIANNEXATION;The Tungi Sultanate is the southernmost sultanate that is part of our state in Cabo Delgado. $FROMCOUNTRY$ signed treaties with the rulers of Tungi some years ago, and they have considered themselves their protectors for a while now. Today, the local Portuguese militias have chosen to occupy the little sultanate, ignore our relations with who is part of our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMATONGAQUESTION;Mabhudu, an amaTonga kingdom in Mbazwana, has resisted their Zulu overlords for now decades, and now they find themselves as a sovereign state. This though comes with risks, and a lot of colonial nation have started encroaching into their national issues. If we ask them if they would want to be our protectorate, with their current situation they might accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMATONGAQUESTIONMABHUDU;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to ask us if we would want to become their protectorate, as the rest of the colonial nations are starting to colonize the continent and we seem to be a weak power comparatively to them, armed with cannons and with armies trained to win battles while being heavily outnumbered. This might be an offer we want to consider so we're able to survive this situation, and we might regain independence later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MABHUDUANNEX;Mabhudu has been our protectorate for now years, and it might be time to centralize our rule in the region, with Mabhudu becoming part of the Colony of Natal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEMSEBE;After we lost our war against the British, they partitioned our kingdom into thirteen different chiefdoms to divide any resistance against their colonial rule. A year ago, though, they corrected this error, and ceded eight of the chiefdoms to our great king, Cetshwayo. Most of the remaining chiefdoms were ceded to Zibhebhu, part of the royal branch which was defeated in the last Zulu Civil War, and part of the clan of the Mandlakazi. This has lead to conflict in what once was the Zulu Empire, with Zibhebhu and Cetshwayo being aided by Boer mercenaries. Zibhebhu had attacked Cetshwayo in Ulundi a month ago, where he won, and Cetshwayo has died today in Eshowe, near the border with the Cape Colony. His faction, the uSuthu, is still fighting with Dinuzulu at its head, who hopes to someday reinstate his branch of the royal family to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DINUZULUHELP;We have been able to find where the biggest kraal of the Mandlakazi is, near the city of Tshaneni. In the meantime, we've recovered with uSuthu support more than 50% of Zululand, but they have fortified the reminder thanks to Boers from the Oranje River. As we can't overpower them, we need outside support, and as vassals of $FROMCOUNTRY$ we will try to ask them for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZULUWARHELP;After the Zulu lost the war against us, we partitioned them into thirty different chiefdoms so they wouldn't be able to unite and resist our rule anymore. A year after this decision, though, we had to merge eight of the chiefdoms under Cetshwayo, part of the uSuthu branch of the Zulu royal family. Most of the remaining chiefdoms allied with Zibhebhu, part of the Mandlakazi Zulu royal family branch, and a civil war has dragged on for a while now. The uSuthu have asked us for help as the Mandlakazi are being helped by Boers from Orange, but we might want to keep them in civil war so they can't regain full control and they keep being our vassal until we eventually annex them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLETSHANENI;We have acquired enough arms to fight Zibhebhu and the Mandlakazi, and they've made a fighting retreat to their kraal in Tshaneni. There, heavy rifle fire has made their resistance fail, and most of their army has died in the fighting - and the survivors have escaped to Tongaland. We can finally declare the Zulu Kingdom is back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NOHELPZULUBOERQUESTION;$FROMCOUNTRY$ hasn't responded, and we don't have any foreign support. Should we ask Transvaal for support, regardless of our hate towards the Boer states' historical and repeated encroachment of our territory, or should we continue without foreign support?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRNEXPLAINCIVILWARNTHOUSAND;After the Zulu lost the war against the British, they were partitioned into thirty different chiefdoms so they wouldn't be able to unite and resist their rule. A year after this decision, though, they had to merge eight of the chiefdoms under Cetshwayo, part of the uSuthu branch of the Zulu royal family. Most of the remaining chiefdoms allied with Zibhebhu, part of the Mandlakazi Zulu royal family branch, and a civil war has dragged on for a while now. The uSuthu asked the British for help two weeks ago as the Mandlakazi have better arms, but they refused. Now they have asked us for help, and we could use this opportunity to get in return a port in St. Lucia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NIEUWEREPUBLIEK;Thanks to our support given to the Zulus, we've been able to use the militias we sent to establish a new Boer Republic under our influence, the Nieuwe Republiek. This has led to a breaking of relations with Zululand, and the British won't like that we annexed land that was part of their vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NIEUWEREPZUL;After our victory in Tshaneni, the Boers that helped us settled in our territory, and they have founded a new Boer republic in our Northern and Eastern provinces. Our alliance with the Boers has been broken, and we stand alone. If only the British could help us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NIEUWEREPENG;After the Zulu and Boer victory in Zululand - they asked the Boers for help because we refused -, the Boers have taken over most of Zululand and formed the Nieuwe Republiek. The Zulus have asked us for help, and we now might want to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NIEUWEREPENGTWO;After the Zulu and Boer victory in Zululand - they asked the Boers for help because we refused -, the Boers have taken over most of Zululand and formed the Nieuwe Republiek, which owns land on the coast of Zululand and might potentially give sea access to Transvaal.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
ZULULANDANNEXED;With the current situation in Zululand, we are forced to annex Zulu if we want to continue to encroach on the Boers' Zulu Coast before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_drakensberg_title;Claim the Drakensberg Mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_drakensberg_desc;With our current position in the Drakensberg Mountains, we could consider claiming the entire mountain chain, becoming a state powerful enough to face the powers of the region from the peaks of the Great Drakensberg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_lowveld_title;Claim the Lowveld, Bushveld and Highveld;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_lowveld_desc;We have managed to form the $COUNTRY$, and we now are a power to be reckoned with. As we tower over the plains that surround us, we could integrate them into our great state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PRELUDEKLEINREPUBLIEK;Two hunters, Joachim Johannes Ferreira and Frans Ignatius Maritz, have asked our administration for a permit to hunt in the southeast of our country. This would mean letting Boer settlers inside our country, though at least we could, and would, limit their numbers, but it would bring foreign investment and further connection with the surrounding countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PRELUDEKLEINREPUBLIEKTRN;Two hunters, Joachim Johannes Ferreira and Frans Ignatius Maritz, have asked the Swazi for a permit to hunt in the southeast of Swaziland. They have refused their permit, as letting in Boer settlers is for them "a threat to their sovereignty".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PRELUDEKLEINREPUBLIEKSUA;The Boers have sent us another letter, and now they are supported by Transvaal. They will pay §G30,000¤§!, double what they wanted to pay beforehand. Will we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KLEINVRYSTAAT;The Boers we let to settle in eMkhondo have taken over the province and created a Boer republic named Klein Vrystaat, founding the city of Piet Retief. The province has been completely lost, but at least we conserve our claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KLEINVRYSTAATTRN;The Boers that had settled in eMkhondo have taken over the Swazi province and founded the Klein Vrystaat, which was so free it has joined us. They have founded the city of Piet Retief and expulsed the Swazi aristocracy, as they have ruled part of the land for now more than half a decade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEOMAKAPANSGAT;Some months ago, Hermanus Potgieter was searching for ivory near the Nyl River in our southern districts, an area ruled by chiefs Makapan and Mankopane. A dispute caused the chiefs to massacre the travellers, claiming 28 lives. Piet Potgieter subsequently organized a punitive commando, and the tribesmen, armed with guns, retreated into Makapansgat cave, where they suffered heavy casualties. Today, in their attempts to break out from the cave, a sniper managed to fatally shoot Piet Potgieter, ending the Potgieter's hegemony in Zoutpansberg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZOUTPANSBERGTOTHEGROUND;In 1866, our administration intervened in khosi Ramabulana's succession dispute in the Zoutpansberg Mountains, and one claimant, his son Makhado, torched a Voortreker settlement near Zoutpansberg, The next year, Paul Kruger was sent from Pretoria to restore order, but upon reaching Zoutpansberg he realized that holding the town was impossible and ordered an evacuation. Following its abandonment a local chief named Katze-Katze razed Zoutpansberg to the ground, and the survivors founded Pietersburg further south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCHOEMANSDALTOTHEGROUND;In 1866, our administration intervened in khosi Ramabulana's succession dispute in the Zoutpansberg Mountains, and one claimant, his son Makhado, torched a Voortreker settlement near Schoemansdal, The next year, Paul Kruger was sent from Pretoria to restore order, but upon reaching Schoemansdal he realized that holding the town was impossible and ordered an evacuation. Following its abandonment a local chief named Katze-Katze razed Schoemansdal to the ground, and the survivors founded Pietersburg further south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAKGOBAREBELLION;Chief Makgoba and other baPedi and Venda chiefs have resisted our administration since we annexed what was their lands, and have been in a guerrilla war since. Today, the baPedi and Venda have launched an offensive to take Lydenburg and Mbombela, entering lands outside their jurisdiction. We are thereby forced to counterattack and finish this rebellion off once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GERMANSDEMANDZANZIBAR;The Germans have demanded that we cede all of our territories in Zanj, from Tanga to north of Tungi. This is a clear violation of our national sovereignty, but we might want to conserve good relations with the Germans no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DYORIWATTARA;Our kingdom rules over numerous nationalities, between them the Tyefo, Bobo-Joola, Bolon, Dafin and Bwamu. Some of these, mainly the Tyefo, have revolted against our state since its establishment and have depleted the resources of our army. Diori Wattara had been able to hold them off, but today he has died from natural causes and the army lays without resources or morale, and they have started mutinying and joining the rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DYORIWATTARABRUH;Gwiriko's king, Dyori Wattara, has died today from natural causes. He had been fighting a rebellion in his southern territories, and with his death Tehini has fallen to the rebels' hands, who have de facto joined our empire. Dyori Wattara's successor, Moru Wattara, has refused to let them gain their independence and have sent their undersupplied army to Tehini to conquer them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TEHINIJOINSKONG;Gwiriko's king, Dyori Wattara, has died today from natural causes. He had been fighting a rebellion in his southern territories, and with his death Tehini has fallen to the rebels' hands, who have de facto joined our empire. Dyori Wattara's successor, Moru Wattara, has for now ignored this secession, but won't for long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MORUWATTARA;15 years ago, our state started collapsing due to increasing pressure by the Tyefo and other nationalities we rule over, and dissent in our Dyula community to our royal family. Today, our great king Moru Wattara has died of natural causes, causing the kingdom to crumble once more. The Tyefo, with more support than ever, have revolted in the south and once again joined the Kong in their effort to secede from our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MORUWATTARABRUH;Gwiriko's king, Moru Wattara, has died today from natural causes. He had been fighting a rebellion in his southern territories, and with his death Banfora has fallen to the rebels' hands, who have de facto joined our empire. Ali Dyan, Moru's successor to the throne, has chosen to react with force and launched an expedition to recover their lost territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BANFORAJOINSKONG;Gwiriko's king, Moru Wattara, has died today from natural causes. He had been fighting a rebellion in his southern territories, and with his death Banfora has fallen to the rebels' hands, who have de facto joined our empire. Ali Dyan, Moru's successor to the throne, has chosen to halt his expeditions to recover their lost lands, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Samo is a region that was once part of the Mossi Kingdoms, but control became decentralized, and now the region is governed by the 3 Mossi clans of the northwest.

found_gwandu_desc;Kebbi is the last fully-independent Hausa state that hasn't been conquered in our great jihad, and it is as close as it can get from Sakkwato. A slim majority of the Kebbi farmers have still ignored the Word of Allah, and its administration does nothing to change this. To fix this issue and stop the infidel Kebbi government from continuing to opress its Muslim population, we must occupy it and form a new entity, the Gwandu Emirate in its place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNDIPENDENCE;The Kingdom of Undi has been a constituent part of the Maravi Confederation since its founding in the late 17th century, and has been a center of Maravi politics ever since, in the 18th century having moved the capital of Maravi from Mankhamba to Maano. In these last decades, Undi has gained more and more autonomy, and today they have broken free from our great and ever prosperous confederation. Our Karonga, what should we do to bring Maravi back to the world stage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YAOCONVERT;The Yao have long been involved in the slave trade, and have trade routes spanning from Paama to Zanzibar and Kilwa.

claim_lunda_ancestry_title;Claim Lunda Ancestry;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_lunda_ancestry_desc;The Chewa people's origins are in Malambo, in what is now inhabited by the Luba, and we were forced to emigrate by ethnic groups further north in the 9th century. In the 15th century, we formed the Maravi Confederation in the northern regions of lake Malawi, and from there we became the most powerful country in the known world. If we had not been expulsed from our homeland, we would probably have not suffered through what we have, but it also means we have a claim to what is now the Lunda and Luba empires, and as we do we shall overcome our enemies and someday become the Lunda Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TSHIDHLODHLOBATTLE;Our people have escaped from the South and the Mfecane, but our fight continues. The Gwangwara, a Ngoni group from the Gaza Empire, have also been forced to escape north, which we shared, and were part of our kingdom until 3 months ago, when a battle broke out between our king M'Mbelwa's forces and the Gwangwara, and we've managed to force them to move east to Songea, south of Uhehe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILWANIATONGA;Ilwani Tonga is situated to the South of Mfuwe, and has had a population of northern Tumbukas and Ngonis for decades. Their Chewa overlords treat them as second-class citizens, and local militias had suggested that they would greatly support our cause if we invaded the region. Some months ago, the Maravi reformed the administration of the region and the Tumbuka and Ngoni lost further representation and control over their land, so a local revolt started in Mfuwe and later expanded to Kasungu. Today, they have beat back the Maravi at Ilwani Atonga, and the Maravi have been forced to mobilize their army. Should we help their lands in exchange for becoming part of our state or let them try to get it themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Local administrators have recently reformed the local region, reducing rights for Tumbuka and Ngoni and taking some of their lands. They have revolted and quickly taken Mfuwe and Kasungu, joining the Ngoni to our North. Should we declare war to subject the rebels to our rule once again or mobilize our army to conquer it later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

KUMBISALEH;Kumbi Saleh was once the capital of the Ghana Empire and a fundamental point of the trans-Saharan gold trade, but desertification and the moving of the local center of trade to Iwalatan or Biru meant that the city lost influence and ended up being abandoned by the late 14th century.

ELYALHABIB;Trarza's collection of taxes and its threat to bypass Saint-Louis by sending gum to the British traders at Portendick and Nwakshut eventually brought them into direct conflict with the French. In 1825, a Trarza emir signed an agreement between our Kingdom and the Trarza, promising an end to raids in Waalo territory in exchance of the Emir taking the heiress of Waalo as a bride, prompting the French to declare the Franco-Trarzan War of 1825 and expanding their influence in Saint-Louis. Now, with the French threats renewing, we could enthrone Ely as our king (brak) to create an alliance between our states and eventually unite in one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ROYALMONOPOLY;The Portuguese Royal Family had had for a while a monopoly over the ivory trade to Angola, and they were our biggest partner, so we were forced to lower prices and the trade became unprofitable.
