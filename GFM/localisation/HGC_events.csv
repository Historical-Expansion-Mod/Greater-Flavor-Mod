goldentitle;The Golden Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;
goldendesc;The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was sanctioned by Isabel, Imperial Princess of Brazil, who was regent at the time while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. It was signed in $YEAR$ and was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It had only two articles. The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

frajulydesc;The republicans had never forgiven Louis-Philippe for “confiscating” their revolution in 1830. The urban workers, moved by their misery and by the powerful social myths engendered by the Revolution of 1789, remained unreconciled. Beginning in 1847, the leaders of the opposition set out to take advantage of this restless mood and to force the regime to grant liberal reforms. Since public political meetings were illegal, they undertook a series of political “banquets” to mobilize the forces of discontent. This campaign was to be climaxed by a mammoth banquet in Paris on February 22, 1848. But the government, fearing violence, ordered the affair canceled. On the 22nd, crowds of protesting students and workers gathered in the streets and began to clash with the police and by the morning of February 24, the angry crowd was threatening the royal palace. Louis-Philippe, confronted by the prospect of civil war, hesitated and then retreated once more. What will the king do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

f2empiredesc;In 1848, the voters of the second French Republic choose Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who had returned from British exile in September, as their president. During the next two years, President Bonaparte played his cards carefully, trying to win the hearts of the the Roman catholics and the population. During his mandate, his efforts to please the assembly probably derived from his hope that the assembly would reciprocate: he wanted funds from the treasury to pay his personal debts and run his household, along with a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for a second term. By 1851 it was clear that the majority of the assembly was not ready to give the president what he wanted. Louis-Napoléon didn't want to step down and proceeded with a plebiscite to emend the constitution. At the same time, officially inspired petitions for a restoration of the empire began to flow to Paris. The Senate responded to what it described as the nation's desires, and on December 2, 1852...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

nappy3depdesc;After the start of the Franco-Prussian war on July 19, 1870, few French or foreign observers anticipated the military disaster that followed. The French armies, sunk in routine and slow to mobilize, were not yet ready to fight when the Prussian forces under Helmuth von Moltke crossed into France. One French army, under Achille-François Bazaine, was bottled up in Metz. Another, under Patrice de Mac-Mahon, was cornered at Sedan. There, on September 1, the Prussians won a clear-cut victory: Napoleon III himself was taken prisoner. The regime could not survive such a humiliation. When the news reached Paris on September 4, crowds filled the streets and converged on the Corps Législatif, demanding the proclamation of a republic. The imperial officials...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

argsectitle;The 1853 Constituent Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
argsecdesc;Argentinian dictator, Juan Manuel de Rosas, stayed in power for more than twenty years. This fact was partly because of the weakness of Argentina's natural rival in the Río de la Plata area, Brazil, which had been involved in a civil war (1835–45) in Rio Grande do Sul. Once the rebellion was put down, it was only a question of time until Brazil again influenced the Río de la Plata region. This influence opposed Rosas, and it worked in support of a rebellion by General Justo José de Urquiza, governor of the province of Entre Ríos. In 1851 Urquiza formed an alliance with Brazil and Uruguay. The allies defeated his main army in the Battle of Caseros, just outside Buenos Aires. Thus the Platine War came to an end. Rosas, escaped to England, where he died in 1877. General Urquiza called a constitutional convention in 1852 and the convention adopted a constitution that went into effect on May 25, 1853. The first elected president was Urquiza and the first capital was Paraná.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC55560;After the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the republic that was proclaimed early in the afternoon of Saturday, November 9, 1918, is often called the “accidental republic.” When Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the so-called Majority Socialists, accepted the imperial chancellorship from Max von Baden, it was with the understanding that he would do his utmost to save the imperial system from revolution. Ebert believed that the only way to accomplish this would be by transforming Germany into a constitutional monarchy.

EVTNAME50004;The Shift to Liberalism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50004;García Moreno's death in 1875, as he himself might have forecast, brought a period of near anarchy. Conservatives and liberals struggled for power. But Ecuador had become part of the world market: the importance of the coast slowly increased, and the liberals of that area increasingly dominated the economy. A new liberal hero emerged from the lower classes as the leader of the coastal reaction to Sierra conservatism and clericalism. A man of great personal magnetism, Gen.

EVTNAME50006;The Democratic Stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50006;After the War of the Pacific, a vigorous debate among civilian elites spawned the development of new political parties. Mining entrepreneurs, who had become the most important economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include indemnification for lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for mining exports. The Liberal Party denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives. Despite these differences, both parties were primarily interested in political and economic modernization, and their ideological outlooks were similar. The governments in power elected by a small, literate electorate brought Bolivia its first relative political stability and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50007;Capital moves to La Paz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50007;In 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potosí to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites. This changed marked the end of the Conservative Party dominance and the era of the Liberal Party that ruled until 1920.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50008;The Aristocratic Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50008;In $YEAR$, Nicolás de Piérola, after allying his party with the Civil Party of Peru to organize guerrillas with fighters to occupy Lima, ousted Andrés Avelino Cáceres and once again became president of Peru. After a brief period in which the military once again controlled the country, civilian rule was permanently established with Pierola's election. His second term was marked by his reconstruction of a devastated Peru by initiating fiscal, military, religious, and civil reforms. Until the 1920s, this period was called the "Aristocratic Republic", since most of the presidents that ruled the country were from the social elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50011;The September 11th Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50011;Urquiza called the San Nicolás Agreement, so that all provinces agreed to convene the 1853 Constituent Assembly. This was resisted in Buenos Aires, and the unitarians took advantage of a temporary absence of Urquiza from the city to do the September 11 revolution and secede Buenos Aires from the confederation. It was now the State of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50012;Buenos Aires attempted military actions against the Confederation, to prevent the work of the Assembly, but failed. The Argentine Constitution of 1853 was sanctioned on May 1, 1853, inviting Buenos Aires to return. Buenos Aires wrote their own constitution in 1854. Both countries, the Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires, accepted the status quo, with a serious danger of becoming a definitive secession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

President Santiago Derqui, who had been backed by Urquiza, resigned, and the Argentine Confederation was replaced by the Argentine Republic on December 17, 1861. Mitre, who despite victory reaffirmed his commitment to the 1860 constitutional amendments, was elected the republic's first president in 1862.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC599998;The outbreak of War with the Germans brought an upsurge of patriotic fervor centered on the tsar. The Germanic form of the city's name was changed to its Russian version. The city was renamed Petrograd, meaning "Peter's City", to remove the German word "burg.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC599999;For the sake of stability, tsarism insisted on rigid autocracy that effectively shut out the population from participation in government. At the same time, to maintain its status as a great power, it promoted industrial development and higher education, which were inherently dynamic. The result was perpetual tension between government and society, especially its educated element, known as the intelligentsia. This tension and the intelligentsia publishing works criticizing the government, the hardships of war and the technological backwardness of Russia that was demonstrated during the defeat at the Crimean War are contributing to a increase in militancy and consciousness among our people. Socialist and Communists ideals are spreading among the urban workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600000;The February Revolution of 1917 was the first of two revolutions in Russia in 1917. Centered on the then capital Petrograd (modern day St. Petersburg) in March (late February in the Julian calendar). This revolution appeared to break out spontaneously, without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which were compounded by the impact of World War I. Bread rioters and industrial strikers were joined on the streets by disaffected soldiers from the city's garrison. As more and more troops deserted, and with loyal troops away at the Front, the city fell into a state of chaos, leading...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600001;Lenin arrived in Petrograd on April 16, 1917, one month after the Tsar had been forced to abdicate.On his return to Russia, Lenin electrified his own comrades, most of whom accepted the authority of the Provisional Government. Lenin called this government, despite its democratic pretensions, thoroughly imperialist and undeserving of support by Socialists. It was incapable of satisfying the most profound desires of the workers, soldiers, and peasants for immediate peace and division of landed estates among the peasants. Only a soviet government — that is, direct rule by workers, soldiers, and peasants—could fulfill these demands. Therefore, he raised the battle cry, “All power to the Soviets!”. He began publishing papers and stirring up the communists and socialists! What should the provisional government do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600002;The Milyukov note was an incident on the 20th of April 1917, one which resulted in the bolstering of support for the Bolsheviks in Russia, and a widespread mistrust of the Russian Provisional Government. Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov sent the Allied Powers a telegram, one which would prove to be a turning point of 1917. The telegram contained the statement that the Provisional Government would continue the war with the Tsarist war aims. The telegram was leaked to the Bolsheviks by an insider, and they began protests against the Provisional Government, which had previously promised the people that the terror of Tsardom had ended. The consequences were...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600003;The July Days refers to events in 1917 that took place in Petrograd, Russia, between 3 July and 7 July (Julian calendar), when soldiers and industrial workers engaged in spontaneous demonstrations against the Russian Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks tried to provide leadership to the demonstrations. The military attacked the peaceful demonstration and engaged in repression against the Bolsheviks. Lenin went into hiding, while other leaders were arrested. The outcome of the July Days represented a temporary decline in the growth of Bolshevik power and influence in the period before the October Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600004;The Kornilov Affair, was an (alleged) attempted coup d'état by the then Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, General Lavr Kornilov, in August 1917 against the Russian Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerensky. Kerensky, hearing of a possible coup attempt by Kornilov, questioned him and interpreted his responses as a confirmation of his intention to seize power by force. In response, Kerensky dismissed Kornilov from his position. When the telegram to dismiss Kornilov arrived, he believed that Kerensky was acting under intense pressure from the Soviets and consequently the Bolsheviks, therefore he ordered the Third Cavalry Corps to move swiftly to Petrograd to put down what he assumed to be a Bolshevik uprising. The coup failed and Kornilov was incarcerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600005;The October Revolution of 1917 was led by the Bolsheviks, specifically by Lenin, who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military Revolutionary Committee began the takeover of government buildings on 24 October 1917 (O.S.). The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia), was captured. The October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia's short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army, immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks Red Army, in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600008;The Russian Civil War (25 October 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire fought between the Bolshevik Red Army and the White Army, the loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in the Crimea and were evacuated in the autumn of 1920. A number of independent countries – Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland – emerged from the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600009;The civil war has finally ended. The Russian economy was devastated by the war, with factories and bridges destroyed, cattle and raw materials pillaged, mines flooded, and machines damaged. The industrial production value descended to one seventh of the value of 1913, and agriculture to one third. War Communism saved the Soviet government during the Civil War, but much of the Russian economy had ground to a standstill. But now our motherland can finally rebuild itself, in peace, free of the capitalism oppression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600018;The Third International or The Communist International, was an association of national communist parties founded in 1919 by Lenin. Though its stated purpose was the promotion of world revolution, the Comintern functioned chiefly as an organ of Soviet control over the international communist movement. The Comintern emerged from the three-way split in the socialist Second International. A majority of socialist parties, comprising the International's “right” wing, chose to support the war efforts of their respective national governments against exterior enemies. The “centre” faction of the International decried the nationalism of the right and sought the reunification of the Second International under the banner of world peace. The “left” group, led by Vladimir Lenin, rejected both nationalism and pacifism, urging instead a socialist drive to transform the war of nations into a transnational class war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600019;In November 1917, following the October Revolution, the first government of the independent Transcaucasia was created in Tbilisi. The Transcaucasian Commissariat (Sejm) existed for a couple of months following the Bolshevik seizure of power. Later, the Sejm proclaimed the "Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic" and a peace conference was held between the Ottoman Empire and a delegation of the Sejm. The mood prevailing in Tbilisi was very different. Tbilisi acknowledged a state of war between itself and the Ottoman Empire. A new peace conference opened at Batum and at this conference the Ottomans extended their demands. The Armenian and Georgian members of the Republic’s delegation began to stall. Beginning on May 21, the Ottoman army moved ahead once again. The conflict led to a series of battles and on May 26, 1918, Georgia declared independence; two days later, Armenia and Azerbaijan followed suit, dissolving the federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600020;With the bolshevik taking the power in Russia, they are pressuring us to change our government to be more aligned with theirs! They demand a proletariat government in our country! What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600021;The October Revolution of 1917 turned Finnish politics upside down. Now, the new non-Socialist majority of the Parliament desired total independence, and the Socialists came gradually to view Soviet Russia as an example to follow. On November 15, 1917, the Bolsheviks declared a general right of self-determination, including the right of complete secession, "for the Peoples of Russia". On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it temporarily took power in Finland. Worried by the development in Russia, and Finland, the non-Socialist Senate proposed that Parliament declare Finland's independence, which was agreed on in the Parliament on December 6, 1917. On December 18 the Soviet government issued a Decree, recognizing Finland's independence, and on December 22 it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body – VTsIK. Germany and the Scandinavian countries followed without delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600022;Historically, with the outbreak of the World War I, the Russian Empire fell into revolution and civil war. As a part of this larger conflict, the Estonians declared independence from Russia and won their freedom during the Estonian War of Independence. As a symbol of Estonian independence, Yuryev/Dorpat was officially given back its Estonian name, Tartu. The new Communist Russian government acknowledged Estonia's freedom in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu. The Estonians are offering us a peace treaty, what should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600023;Historically, after the Russian Empire lost the Crimean war and was weakened economically and politically, an unrest started in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In Vilnius alone 116 demonstrations were held in 1861. In August 1861, manifestations in Vilnius ended in clashes with the Imperial Russian Army. In spite of Russian police and Cossack interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across Niemen River. After a series of patriotic riots, the Russian Namestnik of Tsar Alexander II, General Karl Lambert, introduced martial law in Poland on 14 October 1861. Public gatherings were banned and some public leaders made outlaws. Now, with the hardships of the Crimean War, the poles, the lithuanians and the ukrainians are rising to make patriotic demonstrations. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600024;The January Uprising was an uprising in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, parts of Ukraine, western Russia) against the Russian Empire. It began on 22 January 1863 and lasted until the last insurgents were captured in 1865. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army, and was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. The rebels set up a provisional government in Congress Poland and are stirring other poles, ukrainians and lithuanians to rise agaisn't us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
