EVTNAME101532;The Ruthenian Triad Publishes 'The Mermaid of the Dniester';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101532;In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by Markiyan Shashkevych, published 'The Mermaid of the Dniester', a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan sought to ban the book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA101532;Ban the book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB101532;Let them have their book;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101533;Lajos Kossuth Released;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101533;A prominent Hungarian liberal, Lajos Kossuth, has finally been released from jail, along with other notable liberals. Since his release he has become something of a national hero to many Hungarians, and he has continued his opposition towards our government. As the editor of the Pesti Hirlap he has talked about the great economic and societal problems within Hungary, advocated full national autonomy within the Habsburg Empire, the immediate emancipation of the serfs - with no compensation to aristocrats - and an end of noble privileges. He has also promoted industrialization by founding the Gyáralapito és Kereskedelmi Társaság (Factory-Founding and Commercial Society).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA101533;Another mouthpiece for the nationalists...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101534;End the Publication of the Pesti Hirlap?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101534;We have tried to put an end to Kossuth’s hostility to our rule for some time now. His criticism of our rule in Hungary is highly influential and therefore highly damaging for us. His chief political weapon is a liberal rag, the Pesti Hirlap, in which he has been able to express his radical views. Perhaps if we were to purchase the newspaper we could put an end to Kossuth’s ramblings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA101534;We must stop this anti-government drivel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB101534;Let it continue to circulate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101535;Hungarian Moderates Sidelined;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101535;By our refusal to ratify reforms that many Hungarians have wanted since 1825, we've sidelined the moderates who wanted reforms but no national autonomy. Kossuth's articles against us in the Pesti Hirlap were the last straw and now the radicals, especially Kossuth, hold the love of the people and more importantly, the majority in Parliament. The Hungarians will not settle for anything less than an autonomous national government. Széchényi István, the very man who started the call for reforms in 1825, writes articles attacking the Pesti Hirlap and Kossuth himself, and together with the moderates, they either join the radicals or like Széchényi drift towards the conservatives. There is now no middle ground in Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101536;Frantisek Palacky and the Czech National Revival;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101536;Considered one of the fathers of modern Czech nation, Palacky played a leading role in the Czech cultural and national revival of the early nineteenth century. At first a proponent of Austro-Slavism, a view that advocated unification and autonomy of Slavs within the framework of the Habsburg monarchy, Palacky later called for complete Czech independence. Palacky's greatest literary contribution was his History of Bohemia, which significantly influenced growing Czech national consciousness as it saw the history of Bohemia as a constant struggle of Germans and Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME101537;France Preseren and the Slovenian National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC101537;A key figure in the development of Slovene nationalism, Preseren led a movement to promote the use of Slovene instead of German at a time when Slovene was dismissed by the Austrian ruling elite as a peasant language, and was not taught in schools. A skilled poet, his works include Zdravljica, which was censored at the time for its national and pan-Slavic message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME146305;Dom Pedro II Weds;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC146305;In spite of the fact that the new consort looked nothing like the pictures sent to the Emperor to help make his choice, after initial hesitations the Emperor has decided to accept his marriage to Princess Teresa Cristina, daughter of the King of the Two Sicilies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC137400;The 'Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal van Van Dale' was the first Dutch dictionary. It was first published after the death of Johan Hendrik van Dale, who had started work on his New Dictionary of the Dutch Language in 1867. This was built upon the original same-named 1864 dictionary of I.M. Calisch and N.S. Calisch. Van Dale did not see the new work published in his lifetime, as he died in 1872. It was finished by his student Jan Manhave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME137401;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC137401;The Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam was founded in $YEAR$ by a group of orthodox-Protestant Christians led by Abraham Kuyper as the first Calvinist university in the Netherlands. Kuyper was a theologian, journalist, politician, and prime minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905. He was a professor of theology as well as the university's first rector magnificus (academic president). Kuyper's philosophy is referred to as Neo-Calvinism. As a reflection of his beliefs, Vrije Universiteit literally means 'Free University' (or 'Liberated University') to signify independence from both government and church. Teaching at the Vrije Universiteit started in 1880 in rooms rented at the Scottish Missionary Church (now the Kleine Komedie theatre), along the Amstel river in Amsterdam's city centre. Here, Kuyper and four fellow professors began lecturing in three faculties: theology, law, and the arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
