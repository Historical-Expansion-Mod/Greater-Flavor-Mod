MON_claim_serbian_leadership_title;Assume Leadership of the Serbs by Force;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_claim_serbian_leadership_desc;NOTE: Serbia may retaliate! While usually on very friendly terms, the reign of prince and later king Nikola I. of Montenegro was marked by his struggles with the Serbian Karadordevic and Obrenovic dynasties over the rulership of all Serbs. It was believed locally that Montenegro was the sole remnant and inheritor of the medieval Serbian Empire, from which its restoration will eventually come from. Historically, a dynastic union was almost achieved when a royal marriage between Montenegro and Serbia, that would put the Petrovic-Njegos dynasty in the line of succession, was agreed upon. This was, however, thwarted when the pro-Russian Karadordevic dynasty was restored in Serbia and Russia chose Serbia as its main horse in the race. We can either attempt to proceed peacefully with the royal marriage and a little... accident, or we can simply march to Belgrade and enforce our leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MONTYMEN_DESC;Against all odds, we, the Montenegrins, are now the leaders of the Serbians. However, there are still some cultural differences present between our two people and we must take a stance on the future of our culture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_restore_pec_title;Restore the Patriarchate of Pec;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_restore_pec_desc;The Patriarchate of Pec Monastery is a medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery located near the city of Peja. Built in the 13th century, it became the residence of Serbian Archbishops. In 1346, when the Serbian Patriarchate of Pec was created, the Monastery became the seat of Serbian Patriarchs. The monastery complex consists of several churches, and during medieval and early modern times it was also used as mausoleum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs. The monastery church is unique in Serbian medieval architecture, with three churches connected as one whole, with a total of four churches. After 1737, the Phanariotes embarked on policy initiatives that led to the exclusion of Serbs in the succession of the patriarchate, which was eventually abolished in September 1766. At the beginning of the First Balkan War, army of the Kingdom of Montenegro entered into Pec. By the Treaty of London, the region of Pec was officially awarded to Montenegro and the Monastery of Pec again became an episcopal seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By extension, a clause in the marriage agreement will stipulate that were the Serbian monarch Alexander to die with no children, the crown of Serbia will pass exactly to prince Mirko. That way, the house of Petrovic-Njegoš would be the sole ruler of the Serbs. While Mirko is not our firstborn, we could convince the crown prince Danilo to refuse the throne later. Let us send an offer to Belgrade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_606_DESC;Prince Nikola I of Montenegro has written a patriotic song called "Onamo, 'namo!" (There, o'er there!). The song's music was composed by Franjo Vimer, partly drawing inspiration from the popular "Hymn of Garibaldi". The song's lyrics call for the liberation of Serb-inhabited lands from the Ottoman Empire, making reference to the medieval Serbian capital of Prizren, the Visoki Decani monastery and the 14th-century Battle of Kosovo. This brazen rhetoric coming from the very ruler of Montenegro may anger the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was planning to upgrade the status of Montenegro by turning it into a kingdom but did not live long enough to see his ambitions realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_GORSKI_VJENAC;Gorski Vjenac (The Mountain Wreath) is a poem and a play written by Prince-Bishop and poet Petar II Petrovic-Njegoš. Njegoš wrote The Mountain Wreath during 1846 in Cetinje and published it the following year after the printing in an Armenian monastery in Vienna. It is a modern epic written in verse as a play, thus combining three of the major modes of literary expression. Set in 18th-century Montenegro, the poem deals with attempts of Njegoš's ancestor Metropolitan Danilo I Petrovic-Njegoš to regulate relations among the region's warring tribes. Written as a series of fictitious scenes in the form of dialogues and monologues, the poem opens with Metropolitan Danilo's vision of the spread of Turkish power in Europe. Torn by inner conflict he sees that the struggle is inevitable, but dreads the issues. The poem is considered a masterpiece of Serbian and Montenegrin literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SLOVAKMEMORANDUM;A new manifesto has been proclaimed at an assembly of about 5,000 Slovaks in Turócszentmárton. It calls for the recognition of Slovaks as their own sovereign nation within Hungary, the creation of an autonomous Upper Hungarian Slovak Land, to be administered by Slovaks through elected representatives, the calls for Slovak to be officially used in affected government offices, courts and schools, and the establishment of a central cultural and scientific institution for Slovaks, Matica Slovenská. What is our response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MARINABASEN;"Marína" is a great work of romantic, reflective and patriotic poetry in Slovak literature, written by Andrej Sládkovic (Andrej Braxatoris), a Slovak Protestant priest, author and translator, between 1844 and 1846, published in Pest in the same year it was finished. The 291 stanzas (2,900 lines) long poem combines themes of unfulfilled love between the author and his student-muse Mária Pišlová with love to one's homeland and author's introspection. The real Mária Pišlová was forced by her mother to marry a rich gingerbread maker instead, which gave Sládkovic's broken heart the impetus to write "Marína". It has now set a new world record for the longest love poem, a position it is sure to keep for many more decades into the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MATICASLOVENSKA;A Slovak cultural institution called "Matica slovenská" was founded in the city of Turciansky Svätý Martin to promote Slovak culture and identity. Inspired by the establishment of the Serbian and Czech Matica, the Slovak Matica established education, research, and publishing programmes, laying the foundations for library and archive activities. It drew members from all parts of the nation and, despite being forbidden from getting involved in political activities, became a representative and a symbol of Slovak “independence”. Gradually, the Matica slovenská became a center of Slovak national life and served as a substitute for national political institutions, which had been prohibited in Hungary. By 1873, the Matica had 1,300 members, many of which included entities such as municipalities, libraries, schools and associations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_lost_plc_lands_title;Reclaim the Lost Lands of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_lost_plc_lands_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! The Commonwealth is again on the world map, and with that comes a new wave of irredentism. Prussia, Inflanty and the governorates of the east must be taken back from the greed of Berlin and the perfidy of Muscovy, lest they descend upon us like vultures again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_plc_ethnic_territories_title;Claim Ethnic Polish-Lithuanian Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_plc_ethnic_territories_desc;§RGain 12 infamy§! As the Commonwealth enters a new era, so does our populace pick up its new ideas. Calls of nationalist Poles and Lithuanians mount to save our oppressed countrymen in Silesia and Lithuania Minor, who the Germans aim to turn into one of them through force. We must save them before it's too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_plr_ethnic_territories_title;Claim Ethnic Ruthenian Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_plr_ethnic_territories_desc;§RGain 8 infamy§! With the recognition of the Ruthenians as the third pillar of our Commonwealth, their culture has flourished. Many now clamor for the rescue of their brethren still under the boot of foreign powers - those in Smolensk, on the old Wild Fields and even across the Carpathians. Let us embrace these claims and show the powers that partition how strong we have gotten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
poland_baltic_thingy_title;The Rights of the Livonians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
poland_baltic_thingy_desc;Livonia - that is Estonia, Inflanty and Courland - has been under Swedish and Russian control for the last two centuries, with both countries having marginalized the native peoples there. Our country, however, is a just and noble claimant to this land - and we shall prove it through granting equal rights to the people who inhabit it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_poland_lithuania_ruthenia_title;The Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_poland_lithuania_ruthenia_desc;With the Commonwealth reborn from the grave, the Ruthenians once again live robbed of their full rights. Sympathisants in the government have proposed the creation of a third, Ruthenian territory, in which the locals will be free to govern themselves in their native tongue as equal peoples to the Poles and Lithuanians. Further proposed amendments of the constitution will cement their status as the newest integral part of our state, free of oppression. The reform pack will transform our Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into the Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth. Long live the new Commonwealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
POLONIA700_title;Triumph of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;
POLONIA700_desc;With fire and sword have we brought deluge to our enemies - from Berlin in the west to Moscow in the east, from the Baltic in the north to the fire in the steppe of the south. Poles, Lithuanians and Ruthenians stand proudly in their liberated homeland and no foreign power can take it from them again. In a landmark conference held in London, the former partitioning powers have begrudginly agreed to disawov their land grabs of 1772 onwards and to formally recognize the borders we held prior.§Y The feeling, however, is that the tide of nationalism will never fully allow the Germans to rescind their claims on the German-majority coast connecting Berlin to Prussia.§! But for now, we can say - we have not perished yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
