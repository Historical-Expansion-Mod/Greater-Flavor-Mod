MON_claim_serbian_leadership_title;Assume Leadership of the Serbs by Force;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_claim_serbian_leadership_desc;NOTE: Serbia may retaliate! While usually on very friendly terms, the reign of prince and later king Nikola I of Montenegro was marked by his struggles with the Serbian Karadordevic and Obrenovic dynasties over the rulership of all Serbs. It was believed locally that Montenegro was the sole remnant and inheritor of the medieval Serbian Empire, from which its restoration will eventually come from. Historically, a dynastic union was almost achieved when a royal marriage between Montenegro and Serbia, that would put the Petrovic-Njegos dynasty in the line of succession, was agreed upon. This was, however, thwarted when the pro-Russian Karadordevic dynasty was restored in Serbia and Russia chose Serbia as its main horse in the race. We can either attempt to proceed peacefully with the royal marriage and a little... accident, or we can simply march to Belgrade and enforce our leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MONTYMEN_DESC;Against all odds, we, the Montenegrins, are now the leaders of the Serbians. However, there are still some cultural differences present between our two people and we must take a stance on the future of our culture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_restore_pec_desc;The Patriarchate of Pec Monastery is a medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery located near the city of Peja. Built in the 13th century, it became the residence of Serbian Archbishops. In 1346, when the Serbian Patriarchate of Pec was created, the Monastery became the seat of Serbian Patriarchs. The monastery complex consists of several churches, and during medieval and early modern times it was also used as mausoleum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs. The monastery church is unique in Serbian medieval architecture, with three churches connected as one whole, with a total of four churches. After 1737, the Phanariotes embarked on policy initiatives that led to the exclusion of Serbs in the succession of the patriarchate, which was eventually abolished in September 1766. At the beginning of the First Balkan War, army of the Kingdom of Montenegro entered into Pec. By the Treaty of London, the region of Pec was officially awarded to Montenegro and the Monastery of Pec again became an episcopal seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By extension, a clause in the marriage agreement will stipulate that were the Serbian monarch Alexander to die with no children, the crown of Serbia will pass exactly to prince Mirko. That way, the house of Petrovic-Njegoš would be the sole ruler of the Serbs. While Mirko is not our firstborn, we could convince the crown prince Danilo to refuse the throne later.

MON_606_DESC;\n\nPrince Nikola I of Montenegro has written a patriotic song called "Onamo, 'namo!" (There, o'er there!). The song's music was composed by Franjo Vimer, partly drawing inspiration from the popular "Hymn of Garibaldi". The song's lyrics call for the liberation of Serb-inhabited lands from the Ottoman Empire, making reference to the medieval Serbian capital of Prizren, the Visoki Decani monastery and the 14th-century Battle of Kosovo. This brazen rhetoric coming from the very ruler of Montenegro may anger the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_GORSKI_VJENAC;\n\nGorski Vjenac (The Mountain Wreath) is a poem and a play written by Prince-Bishop and poet Petar II Petrovic-Njegoš. Njegoš wrote The Mountain Wreath during 1846 in Cetinje and published it the following year after the printing in an Armenian monastery in Vienna. It is a modern epic written in verse as a play, thus combining three of the major modes of literary expression. Set in 18th-century Montenegro, the poem deals with attempts of Njegoš's ancestor Metropolitan Danilo I Petrovic-Njegoš to regulate relations among the region's warring tribes. Written as a series of fictitious scenes in the form of dialogues and monologues, the poem opens with Metropolitan Danilo's vision of the spread of Turkish power in Europe. Torn by inner conflict he sees that the struggle is inevitable, but dreads the issues. The poem is considered a masterpiece of Serbian and Montenegrin literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SLOVAKMEMORANDUM;\n\nA new manifesto has been proclaimed at an assembly of about 5,000 Slovaks in Turócszentmárton. It calls for the recognition of Slovaks as their own sovereign nation within Hungary, the creation of an autonomous Upper Hungarian Slovak Land, to be administered by Slovaks through elected representatives, the calls for Slovak to be officially used in affected government offices, courts and schools, and the establishment of a central cultural and scientific institution for Slovaks, Matica Slovenská. What is our response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARINABASEN;\n\n"Marína" is a great work of romantic, reflective and patriotic poetry in Slovak literature, written by Andrej Sládkovic (Andrej Braxatoris), a Slovak Protestant priest, author and translator, between 1844 and 1846, published in Pest in the same year it was finished. The 291 stanzas (2,900 lines) long poem combines themes of unfulfilled love between the author and his student-muse Mária Pišlová with love to one's homeland and author's introspection. The real Mária Pišlová was forced by her mother to marry a rich gingerbread maker instead, which gave Sládkovic's broken heart the impetus to write "Marína". It has now set a new world record for the longest love poem, a position it is sure to keep for many more decades into the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MATICASLOVENSKA;\n\nA Slovak cultural institution called "Matica slovenská" was founded in the city of Turciansky Svätý Martin to promote Slovak culture and identity. Inspired by the establishment of the Serbian and Czech Matica, the Slovak Matica established education, research, and publishing programs, laying the foundations for library and archive activities. It drew members from all parts of the nation and, despite being forbidden from getting involved in political activities, became a representative and a symbol of Slovak 'independence'. Gradually, the Matica slovenská became a center of Slovak national life and served as a substitute for national political institutions, which had been prohibited in Hungary. By 1873, the Matica had 1,300 members, many of which included entities such as municipalities, libraries, schools and associations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME800;The Official Russian Flag;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800;\n\nYour Majesty, times are changing and our Empire now has the need for not only personal banners and merchant flags, but also an official state flag. Bernhard Karl von Koehne, the head of the Heraldry Department of the Governing Senate, proposes a black-gold-white flag derived from the Imperial Coat of Arms. Another option would be to officialize the de facto used white-blue-red civil ensign. Which option would Your Majesty prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800OPTA;Sign the decree on the new heraldic flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT800OPTB;Sign the decree on the old civil ensign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME801;Amendment to the Flag Decree;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC801;\n\nThe black-yellow-white flag existed as an official flag for almost 25 years - however, on 28 April 1883, the edict "On flags for decorating buildings in solemnities" was issued. It allowed to use only white-blue-red flags to decorate buildings. Shall we expand this edict to make the white-blue-red flag the official flag of Russia again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT801OPTA;Let us use white-blue-red.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT801OPTB;Keep the current flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME802;Imperial Flag in Disuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC802;\n\nThe heraldic or black-gold-white imperial flag has never enjoyed much popularity, yet murky legislation ensures it still flies on certain places. Upcoming grand festivities this year give us the opportunity to finally settle this issue and completely settle on a flag that will surely never change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT802OPTA;White, blue and red will be fully used again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT802OPTB;Unshakably decree the usage of the heraldic flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT807DESC;\n\nWilliam III, King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxemburg has died today at the age of 73. The king was a man of immense stature and with a boisterous voice. He could be gentle and kind, then suddenly he could become intimidating and even violent. An autocrat at heart, he was inclined to terrorize and humiliate his courtiers and was cruel to animals as well. Most people around him agreed that he was, to some degree, insane.\n\nAll of the late king's sons have preceded him to the grave. The succession laws were thus changed three years ago and now his underage daughter Wilhelmina succeeds to the throne in a regency. However, Luxemburg does not permit female succession. Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg, the closest male relative, now becomes the Grand Duke of an independent Luxemburg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME810;Death of Marie Louise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC810;\n\nMarie Louise of the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, former wife of Napoleon Bonaparte and the mother of his only legitimate son, has died at the age of 56 of pleurisy. Charles II of Bourbon-Parma, duke of Lucca and previously the king of the Napoleonic client kingdom of Etruria, has now very reluctantly accepted the inheritance of the late Empress. It is expected that he will abdicate once he has secured the duchy for his heirs.\n\nThe accession of the house of Bourbon-Parma provides a prudent opportunity to change the flag of our duchy and make us more recognizable. The newly proposed flag is attached to the top of this document. Shall we proceed with the change or not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
