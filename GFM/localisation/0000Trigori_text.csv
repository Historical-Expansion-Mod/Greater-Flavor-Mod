MON_claim_serbian_leadership_desc;§RNOTE: Serbia may retaliate!§! While usually on very friendly terms, the reign of prince and later king Nikola of Montenegro was marked by his struggles with the Serbian Karadordevic and Obrenovic dynasties over the rulership of all Serbs. It was believed locally that Montenegro was the sole remnant and inheritor of the medieval Serbian Empire, from which its restoration will eventually come from. Historically, a dynastic union was almost achieved when a royal marriage between Montenegro and Serbia, that would put the Petrovic-Njegos dynasty in the line of succession, was agreed upon. This was, however, thwarted when the pro-Russian Karadordevic dynasty was restored in Serbia and Russia chose Serbia as its main horse in the race. We can either attempt to proceed peacefully with the royal marriage and a little... accident, or we can simply march to Belgrade and enforce our leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MONTYMEN_DESC;Against all odds, we, the Montenegrins, are now the leaders of the Serbians. However, there are still some cultural differences present between our two people and we must take a stance on the future of our culture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_restore_pec_title;Restore the Patriarchate of Pec;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_restore_pec_desc;The Patriarchate of Pec Monastery is a medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery located near the city of Peja. Built in the 13th century, it became the residence of Serbian Archbishops. In 1346, when the Serbian Patriarchate of Pec was created, the Monastery became the seat of Serbian Patriarchs. The monastery complex consists of several churches, and during medieval and early modern times it was also used as mausoleum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs. The monastery church is unique in Serbian medieval architecture, with three churches connected as one whole, with a total of four churches. After 1737, the Phanariotes embarked on policy initiatives that led to the exclusion of Serbs in the succession of the patriarchate, which was eventually abolished in September 1766. At the beginning of the First Balkan War, army of the Kingdom of Montenegro entered into Pec. By the Treaty of London, the region of Pec was officially awarded to Montenegro and the Monastery of Pec again became an episcopal seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_marry_serbia_desc;Ever in the struggle over the leadership of the Serbian people, our lord Nikola and his advisors have presented a curious scheme: the prince Mirko, duke of Grahovo, will marry Natalija Konstantinovic, a granddaughter of Anna Obrenovic, one of the two competing dynasties in Serbia. By extension, a clause in the marriage agreement will stipulate that were the Serbian monarch Alexander to die with no children, the crown of Serbia will pass exactly to prince Mirko. That way, the house of Petrovic-Njegoš would be the sole ruler of the Serbs. While Mirko is not our firstborn, we could convince the crown prince Danilo to refuse the throne later. Let us send an offer to Belgrade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_606_DESC;\n\nPrince Nikola I of Montenegro has written a patriotic song called "Onamo, 'namo!" (There, o'er there!). The song's music was composed by Franjo Vimer, partly drawing inspiration from the popular "Hymn of Garibaldi". The song's lyrics call for the liberation of Serb-inhabited lands from the Ottoman Empire, making reference to the medieval Serbian capital of Prizren, the Visoki Decani monastery and the 14th-century Battle of Kosovo. This brazen rhetoric coming from the very ruler of Montenegro may anger the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MON_DANILO_DEATH;\n\nOur ruler Danilo I has been assassinated! Todor Kadic of the Bjelopavlici clan that did not recognize his rulership struck as Danilo was boarding a ship at the port of Kotor. Nikola I, Danilo's nephew, has succeeded Danilo as the new prince of Montenegro. After centuries of theocratic rule, Danilo was the first Montenegrin secular prince who did not hold the ecclesiastical position of the Vladika. He was planning to upgrade the status of Montenegro by turning it into a kingdom but did not live long enough to see his ambitions realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MON_GORSKI_VJENAC;\n\nGorski Vjenac (The Mountain Wreath) is a poem and a play written by Prince-Bishop and poet Petar II Petrovic-Njegoš. Njegoš wrote The Mountain Wreath during 1846 in Cetinje and published it the following year after the printing in an Armenian monastery in Vienna. It is a modern epic written in verse as a play, thus combining three of the major modes of literary expression. Set in 18th-century Montenegro, the poem deals with attempts of Njegoš's ancestor Metropolitan Danilo I Petrovic-Njegoš to regulate relations among the region's warring tribes. Written as a series of fictitious scenes in the form of dialogues and monologues, the poem opens with Metropolitan Danilo's vision of the spread of Turkish power in Europe. Torn by inner conflict he sees that the struggle is inevitable, but dreads the issues. The poem is considered a masterpiece of Serbian and Montenegrin literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SLOVAKMEMORANDUM;\n\nA new manifesto has been proclaimed at an assembly of about 5,000 Slovaks in Turócszentmárton. It calls for the recognition of Slovaks as their own sovereign nation within Hungary, the creation of an autonomous Upper Hungarian Slovak Land, to be administered by Slovaks through elected representatives, the calls for Slovak to be officially used in affected government offices, courts and schools, and the establishment of a central cultural and scientific institution for Slovaks, Matica Slovenská. What is our response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARINABASEN;\n\n"Marína" is a great work of romantic, reflective and patriotic poetry in Slovak literature, written by Andrej Sládkovic (Andrej Braxatoris), a Slovak Protestant priest, author and translator, between 1844 and 1846, published in Pest in the same year it was finished. The 291 stanzas (2,900 lines) long poem combines themes of unfulfilled love between the author and his student-muse Mária Pišlová with love to one's homeland and author's introspection. The real Mária Pišlová was forced by her mother to marry a rich gingerbread maker instead, which gave Sládkovic's broken heart the impetus to write "Marína". It has now set a new world record for the longest love poem, a position it is sure to keep for many more decades into the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MATICASLOVENSKA;\n\nA Slovak cultural institution called "Matica slovenská" was founded in the city of Turciansky Svätý Martin to promote Slovak culture and identity. Inspired by the establishment of the Serbian and Czech Matica, the Slovak Matica established education, research, and publishing programs, laying the foundations for library and archive activities. It drew members from all parts of the nation and, despite being forbidden from getting involved in political activities, became a representative and a symbol of Slovak 'independence'. Gradually, the Matica slovenská became a center of Slovak national life and served as a substitute for national political institutions, which had been prohibited in Hungary. By 1873, the Matica had 1,300 members, many of which included entities such as municipalities, libraries, schools and associations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME800;The Official Russian Flag;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800;\n\nYour Majesty, times are changing and our Empire now has the need for not only personal banners and merchant flags, but also an official state flag. Bernhard Karl von Koehne, the head of the Heraldry Department of the Governing Senate, proposes a black-gold-white flag derived from the Imperial Coat of Arms. Another option would be to officialize the de facto used white-blue-red civil ensign. Which option would Your Majesty prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT807DESC;\n\nWilliam III, King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxemburg has died today at the age of 73. The king was a man of immense stature and with a boisterous voice. He could be gentle and kind, then suddenly he could become intimidating and even violent. An autocrat at heart, he was inclined to terrorize and humiliate his courtiers and was cruel to animals as well. Most people around him agreed that he was, to some degree, insane.\n\nAll of the late king's sons have preceded him to the grave. The succession laws were thus changed three years ago and now his underage daughter Wilhelmina succeeds to the throne in a regency. However, Luxemburg does not permit female succession. Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg, the closest male relative, now becomes the Grand Duke of an independent Luxemburg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Charles II of Bourbon-Parma, duke of Lucca and previously the king of the Napoleonic client kingdom of Etruria, has now very reluctantly accepted the inheritance of the late Empress. It is expected that he will abdicate once he has secured the duchy for his heirs.\n\nThe accession of the house of Bourbon-Parma provides a prudent opportunity to change the flag of our duchy and make us more recognizable.

UBD_strenghten_governorship_desc;Estabilished after the Greater Northern War, the three Baltic governorates - Livonia, Estland and Courland, after years of Russian rule, have shared the same governor since 1800, despite technically still being separate. If we were able to project enough power in our governorates, we might be able to de facto control all of them, despite the reality on paper being different. But who knows? Perhaps the Tsar would be partial to allow this fait accompli...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31500002;Baltic Governor strengthens Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31500002;\n\nAdquired after the Great Northern War and Partition of Poland, the three Baltic governorates - Livonia, Estland and Courland, despite technically being separate, have shared the same governor since 1800. It seems that the current governor has managed to assert his authority enough that any divisions remain but on paper. Now, he is requested that the administration of his governorships be reformed and unified into a single entity. While this would allow them to better administer the region, we are advised that it could be dangerous to allow this show of ambition to succeed, especially if we were to try to russify and integrate the region in the future. Do we allow the governorates to be merged into one entity, or do we replace the governor with a less ambitious man?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31500003;The Baltic German Plea For Help;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31500003;\n\nAn envoy has arrived from Riga under mundane pretext - in reality bearing a serious message. It would seem that, with our ascendency in the world stage, the Russians fear that if their loyalty was tested, the Baltic Germans would turn their loyalty to a German invader rather than their Russian overlords. Now they are consering to end the Ostsee Rights, close the German Landtags and directly incorporate the Baltic Governorates, perhaps even to subject them to Russification. The envoy asks for help - for the Germans to protect their own shall Russia try to deprive them of their rights. A secret treaty can be drafted... What is our response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_secret_treaty_title;Secret Treaty with the Germans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_secret_treaty_desc;It is becoming more and more probable that the Tsar will decide to abolish our governorate and administrate us directly. In such an event, we would be nigh powerless to resist the Russian onslaught. Our only hope would be to sign a secret treaty with our German brothers in Berlin - that they would come defend us from Russian aggression. We cannot let ourselves become lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31500006;\n\nThe Russians have decreed our governorate forfeit - the lands are henceforth to be administered directly as a part of Russia. We may accept - or we may resist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31500008;\n\nThe arrogant Balts led by their treacherous German landowners have, upon hearing news of our proclamation of integration, declared independence, capturing Russian officials and taken control over the Baltic Provinces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31500009;\n\nPer the secret treaty we have signed with the Baltic Germans, they now ask for our help against the Russians, with Russian officials being captured by German and Baltic militias, as skirmishes already mark the beginning the Baltic fight for independence! Shall we honor the treaty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31500010;\n\nDire news! Apparently, our worst fears have proven true! The Baltic government has signed a secret defense treaty with Berlin against us - and now German troops march east to protect their Baltic brethen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31500012;\n\nAs the dust settles, we begin to transition our provisional government to a more permanent one. For quite some time now, there have been debates in Riga about the future of our nation and there even envoys from Germany going around and helping decide on what would be best for the Baltic. Today, the most proeminent figures of the Baltic Provinces gather in Riga to finally decide upon how will be governed from now on. First, we could crown a monarch, the Grand-Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and representative of the German entourage as our new head of state. We could also opt to empower the local Landtags while having no monarch, becoming something of an eastern Switzerland. Finally, our generals would be willing to help solidify our new country - temporarily, of course. We shall decide soon, as the crowd outside grows more and more unruly by the day, with talks of curtailing German influence turning into a threat our government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, since the Georgians have been unable to defend themselves properly against the Persians, even after our garrison has left Tbilisi, our gracious sovereign Peter I has decreed to directly annex the kingdom in 1801. Now that the Persians have been beaten back, perhaps it would be prudent to re-uphold the treaty and restore our loyal servant and chamberlain, the prince Bagrat, son of George XII, in Kartli-Kakheti, instead of relying on the unpopular viceregal administration? A strong and loyal native state would, after all, be a beneficial buffer zone between the Ottoman and Persian empires...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If we want to become a strong state, we must resolve the ancient succession issues. The princes (batonishvili) are unfortunately too numerous to be killed off - it appears that the only option would be to pay them generous compensations and establish some sort of a set legal framework for their positions within the court and administration. Finally, we should get formal recognition from our overlord to confirm our rulership over all Georgia, which would also enable us to slowly absorb the fiefdoms in the west. The whole endeavor will be costly, but it is necessary. For a united Georgia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GEO_found_society_desc;The Society was a charity founded by the noblemen Ilia Chavchavadze, Dimitri Kipiani, and local educators like Iakob Gogebashvili and Mariam Jambakur-Orbeliani in May 1879 in order to promote a cultural renaissance among the peasantry of Georgia. The Society ran a network of schools, bookshops and libraries throughout the country, trained teachers, and sponsored Georgian-language journals and magazines. Prince Chavchavadze, a prominent writer, went on to play a leading role in the Society, succeeding the first chairman Kipiani in 1885 until his assassination in 1907. In 1885, the Mingrelian prince Niko Dadiani donated his father's rich personal library collection, including old Georgian manuscripts, to the charity. The organization involved virtually all active Georgian men of letters, several philanthropists and officials, and was instrumental in Georgian national revival in the latter half of the 19th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
