EVTDESC6011;\n\nThe Pioneer Column was a force raised by General Jacobus Herculaas de la Rey and several prominent burghers in Pretoriain $YEAR$ and used in his efforts to annex the territory of Mashonaland. De la Rey was anxious to secure Matabeleland and Mashonaland before the Germans, Portuguese or British did. His first step was to persuade the Matabele King Lobengula to sign a treaty giving him rights to mining and administration (but not settlement as such) in the area of Mashonaland which was ruled by the King by use of coercion and murderous raids involved tribute-taking and abduction of young men and women. Using his Concession between De la Rey's Suid-Afrika Kolonial Company and Lobengula, he then sought and obtained a charter from the South African government allowing him to act. The column crossed the river Tuli into Matabeleland and halted at a naturally flat and marshy meadow bounded by a steep rocky hill, raising the Boer union flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bloemfontein, the city of roses? Pietermaritzburg, one of the first settlements of the Voortrekkers? Pretoria, center of the Zuid-Afrikaanische Republiek?

EVTDESC6014;\n\nOne of the parties that have as part of their agenda, the belief in full citizenship for all no matter one's race, has taken power in the Volksraad. They intend to bring the native peoples back into public life, and are pushing radical programs to do so. Restrictions on blacks in urban areas and on their holding of public sector jobs will be immediately abolished. Self-governing zones in the style of Native-American reservations are to be designated, such as the Xhosaland, where whites will be expelled from governmental positions in favor of the natives. In the longer-term, economic aid and educational preference will be given to Africans to help them catch up to the standard of the rest of the country. The presence of many Xhosa and Zulus in the party administration is very worrying to the more conservative elements of our society, and some say the new government plans the destruction of white peoples in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME6015;Purifying $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6015;\n\nSince its founding, the Volkstaat, true to its name, has been a nation explicitly for the Boer people. Our current government wants to continue this mission through the complete reduction of the native African populations within our lands. There are three proposals in the Volksraad to achieve this goal. The first, and most popular among less hardline groups, is to displace them all into the former Matabeleland regardless of their tribal and ethnic divisions, and appoint civil administrators to watch over them. The more extreme proposal introduced by the current government is for outright killing, with 'Spesiale Aksiegroepe' being deployed to raid and destroy native villages. Both are sure to be time-consuming and expensive, as well as damaging to our international reputation. But something--anything--to purify our land must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME6018;Fertile Lands of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6018;The Transvaal is named for the Vaal river which runs along its southern border. 'Vaal' is the Boer translation of the Khoikhoi name 'Tky-Gariep', meaning 'dull river', referring to the coloration produced by the silt the waters carry in the flood season. The minerals in this silt make the soil fertile, and increase crop yields. Thanks largely to such rivers flowing through it, and the mild climate of the area, the Transvaal is very hospitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6018OPTA;'N Pragtige land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6019;Boer Commandos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6019;\n\nOn the Cape frontier in the 18th century, a system of local defense emerged wherein all men in a community between 16 and 60 were obliged to join an armed militia called a 'commando' when called upon, much in the manner of American 'minutemen'. Generally many of the people in a commando were related, as Trek groups were often made up of extended family clans traveling and settling together. The commandant of a commando group was elected by popular vote, and his authority generally rested almost entirely on the force of his personality. Despite the disorganized and undisciplined nature of Boer forces in this period, their methods proved very effective against both natives and the British. The local and familial nature of the commando provided a very motivated force, and the Trekkers were masters of fieldcraft. The Boers made extensive use of skirmishing tactics, with riflemen often harrying enemy forces with stunningly accurate fire from the saddle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6019OPTA;Fitting warriors for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6020;The Burgerkryg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6020;Disputes in the fractitious Zuid-Afrikaanische Republiek came to a head when president of the ZAR Martinus Pretorius was elected president of the Oranje Free State as well. The constitution forbade holding foreign office, so the Volksraad granted Pretorius half a year's leave and appointed Johannes Grobler as acting president and hoped for a resolution. Pretorius elected to give up his presidency of the ZAR, and acting president Grobler remained. Many of the townsmen, called Burgers, in the Transvaal were extremely dissatisfied with the Volksraad's handling of the constitutional crisis. They gave their support to Commandant-General Stephanus Schoeman, the "Stormvogel den Noorden", Stormbird of the North, so-called due to his red hair and fiery temperment. Schoeman attempted to remove Grobler and proclaimed himself president. Conflict erupted when the Volksraad declared Schoeman's faction to be rebels in $YEAR$. The commander-in-chief Paul Kruger, backed by the Volksraad, led the 'state army' in several skirmishes against the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6020OPTA;Schoeman is forced out, hold elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6020OPTB;Schoeman becomes president, the Volksraad steps down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6021;The Afrikaner Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6021;\n\nDescended from the Dutch Calvinists, the church of the Boers was molded by their unique experiences and surroundings. French Huguenots and German Lutheran missionaries were early influences on the church in Africa, leading to it growing apart from its continental parent. This history is essential to understanding the distinctive concept of "calling" that developed among the Afrikaners. These attitudes, very early adopted, went with them through later conflicts, formed in a way that seemed to them obviously crafted by the hand of God Himself. They believed themselves preserved by God's own wisdom and Providence. The things they suffered, and the strong bonds between them that were formed through it all, seemed to confirm this idea at every turn. Their history as a people has a central place in forming the Boer religion. In this way, a distinctive folk character became attached to their Calvinistic beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6021OPTA;Promote these teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6021OPTB;Too unorthodox.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6100;Little Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6100;\n\nThe town of Asmara first began to grow in importance when it governor Martini made it the capital over Massawa. A railway to the coast passing through Ghinda, built under the direction of Carlo Cavanna, allowed easy access to Asmara and helped kick off an economic boom. Many Italians immigrated to Asmara, and it soon took on a distinctly Italian character. Due to the age and frailty of many of the city's old buildings, along with two earthquakes, the city essentially had to be rebuilt from the ground up. It was remade in the image of contemporary Italy, and many projects were undertaken to "experiment with radical new designs" in architecture. By 1939, Asmara had a population 93000, of which 58000 were Italian. The city took on a distinctly Italian character, and became known as "Picolla Roma", "Little Rome".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6100OPTA;Avanti Italia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6101;Tripoli Grand Prix;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6101;\n\nEarly motorsports were embraced enthusiastically by many Italians, perhaps due to the country being home to many producers of high-performance automobiles. Trying to capitalize on this popularity, the colonial government of Italian Tripolitania sponsored the Tripoli grand prix, in the hopes that it would bring tourism and consequently, lead to more Italians settling there. The grand prix soon ran into financial trouble and was nearly canceled. However, the president of Tripoli's auto club, Egidio Sforzini, had a state-of-the-art 13 kilometer track built with a grandstand that could hold 10000 people, and amenities to rival any course in Europe. The Tripoli Grand Prix rebounded to became one of the biggest racing events in the world, and saw several renowned racing greats such as Achille Varzi and Hermann Lang on its track.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME6022;Voorste Mense;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6022;\n\nBefore great numbers of Boers departed from the Cape on the Great Trek, there were a few brave souls who ventured into the interior of Southern Africa in small groups and founded communities far from any colonial authority. One such settlement was Zoutpansberg, "Saltpan Mountain", founded by exiled farmer Louis Tregardt, soon joined by the clans of Hendrik Potgieter and Hans van Rensburg. These early Voortrekkers were known as "Voorste Mense", "First men". Even prior to these pioneers was Coenraad de Buys, a mysterious figure who fled the Cape in 1795, and by the time the Trekkers encountered him near Zoutpansberg, he was patriarch of a "half-caste clan" of several hundred people, many his own children by local women. These mountain communities remained very insular from both the natives and the Boer republics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6022OPTA;A promised land in the wilderness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6023;The Mfecane;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6023;The Mfecane, meaning "The Crushing" or "The Scattering", was a period started by the rapid expansion of the Zulu kingdom, pushing other tribes in search of new land and into conflict with their neighbors. One such group was the Matabele, who came to dominate the area that was to become the Transvaal. To eliminate all opposition, the Matabele king ordered widespread killing and devastation on the native tribes. The death toll is estimated to be as high as two million, and the region was nearly entirely depopulated for years. Many of the natives near our settlements have been affected by this tribal conflict and consequent famine, as we neither offer nor could provide them protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6023OPTA;This hardly concerns us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6024;Incorporating Zoutpansberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6024;Zoutpansberg and its surrounding communities have long been independent of outside authority, mostly due to their relative isolation. Now that we have centralized power in the area, they have little choice but to join our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6024OPTA;Very good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6025;Cattle Killing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6025;\n\nIn $YEAR$, a disease spread through the cattle of the Xhosa. Widespread cattle deaths resulted, and it was believed that the deaths were caused by ubuthi, or witchcraft. One Xhosa girl named Nongqawuse claimed she had met three spirits in the bushes, and that they had told her that all cattle should be slaughtered, and their crops destroyed. After the destruction, dead Xhosa would return and help expel the whites, and the ancestors would bring cattle with them to replace those that had been killed. However, the ancestors did not return, and the Xhosa quickly began to starve. Some fled to the British, and plead for help. In some areas, the practice of ritual cattle-killing and crop destruction lasted for several years. By the time it had fully ended, as many as 75000 Xhosa were dead, and the nation was more dependent on the British than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6025OPTA;A dark day for our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6026;Cattle Killing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6026;\n\nIn $YEAR$, a disease spread through the cattle of the Xhosa. They believed this was caused by witchcraft, and a young Xhosa girl came forward with a prophecy that if all the cattle were killed and all their crops destroyed, ancestor spirits would return from the dead and provide great prosperity. This of course failed to materialize, and many thousands of Xhosa are now starving to death. Many among them plea for our help. We could alleviate their suffering somewhat, or allow the famine to continue and weaken the Xhosa, to seize their lands for ourselves. Either way, settlers are moving into now-desolate areas, and the Xhosa are almost entirely under our thumb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6026OPTA;They will soon be our subjects, we must help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6026OPTB;Capitalize on this opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6027;Cross-border Raiding;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6027;\n\nThe traditional mode of warfare for the tribes of Southern Africa was small-scale raiding for plunder and livestock. As opposed to the total, state-against-state warfare of Europe and Asia, conflict in South Africa was usually quite limited. There was an element of ritual to these clashes, as they were mostly intended for posturing and the satisfaction of honor. Being neighbors of these people, cattle rustlers occasional make their way over the border. In a recent incident, a small band of warriors came upon a hamlet and killed several farmers before making off with their cattle. We are now in a position where other western nations would consider an invasion eminently justifiable, or we could simply make some demands for the reparation of damages inflicted by the raiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Having combined his commercial mining interests with Alfred Beit to form the De Beers Mining Corporation, Rhodes also sought to control Johannesburg gold mining industry. It was hoped this could be achieved through fomenting an Uitlander ( British expatriate workers in the mines of $COUNTRY$ ) uprising. When he and Leander Starr Jameson started their incursion into $COUNTRY$ with 600 irregulars they discovered the Uitlanders did not rise up in revolt as hoped; they were soon defeated by local Boer commandos and forced to surrender. Now the question remains, what to do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6051OPTA;Turn the raiders over to Britain for trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6051OPTB;Execute the lot of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6052;The Kruger Telegram;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6052;\n\nThe Boers have manage to repulse an incursion into their sovereign nations by a British raiding party lead by  Cecil Rhodes and Leander Starr Jameson. Should we show solidarity with the Boer states? This would greatly increase our relations and influence with them, but at the expense of our relations with the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6052OPTA;Yes! Send the telegram from our Kaiser to congratulate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6052OPTB;We value our relations with the British more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6053;The ZAR-Oranje-Vrystaat Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6053;\n\nThe Jameson Raid had proven one undeniable fact to the Boer Republics, that the United Kingdom cannot keep its imperial ambitions in check when it came to Southern Africa. Sooner or later the British will come for $COUNTRY$, it is time to make an alliance with our brothers south of Vaal river so we may stand united against British imperialist aggression!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6053OPTA;Let the ZAR and Oranje-Vrystaat stand together as one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6054;ZAR Proposes an Alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6054;\n\nAlthough we in $COUNTRY$ were not directly affected by the Jameson Raid, it is obvious that the British have plans for our nation. We can either stand with the ZAR in the battle to come, or stay neutral and just hope that the winds of war pass us by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6054OPTA;United We Stand! Divided We Fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6054OPTB;If we sign, the British will come after us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6055;Voorste Mense;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6055;Before great numbers of Boers departed from the Cape on the Great Trek, there were a few brave souls who ventured into the interior of Southern Africa in small groups and founded communities far from any colonial authority. The first of these settlements was founded between the Vaal and Vet Rivers after the land was ceded to a group of Voortrekkers under the leadership of Andries Pretorius by the chief of the Tswana tribe, Makwana in 1836. In exchange for this land, Pretorius promised to protect Chief Makwana's tribe against the nearby Basotho tribes, who regularly raided the Tswana and Taung tribes, in addition Makwana was given 42 cattle in compensation by the Trekboers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6055OPTA;We give glory to God for this new home in the wilderness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6056;Founding of the town of Winburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6056;After the Trekboers settled the land between the Vet and Vaal rivers in 1836, population growth lead the realization of a need for an actual centralized settlement for their new land. However there was a prolonged argument to where to establish this new capital among the Trekboers. Eventually in the year $YEAR$ a vote was held by the local Burgers to determine the town's location with Andries Pretorius's group winning and giving the new town the name of Winburg, after the Dutch word winnen (to win). The town grew to become a religious center for Voortrekkers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6056OPTA;Well now that is finally settled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6057;Consolidating the Matabeleland Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6057;Now that $COUNTRY$ had established a protectorate over the whole of the lands of the Matabele, it is best that we further move to place the surrounding land under our benevolent protection to better secure our borders. Expanding our frontiers north to the Zambezi and east to the Munyati and Runde rivers will facilitate this objective as well as opening new lands for colonization and economic development for our aspiring colonists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6057OPTA;We sons of Africa should be the ones who civilize this land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6058;Consolidating the Mashonaland Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6058;Now that $COUNTRY$ secured the lands between the Limpopo and the Munyati and Runde rivers, it is time to invest further in our newest colonial territory by expanding our protectorate to include the highlands east of the Runde as well as the Umwukwe Range that stretch from the Munyati to the Zambezi before one of the greedy colonial powers of Europe stakes their own claims to the area in their insatiable lust for African land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6058OPTA;Better for the natives to be under Boer law than European tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6060;Support the Boers in their defense of their freedom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6060;\n\nThe United Kingdom have decided, in their insatiable desire to dominate the African continent, to attempt to bring the free people of the sovereign South African Republic under their tyrannical heel. We can stand by and watch this happen, or we can make a statement as a world leader to stand up against British imperial ambition here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6060OPTA;The Boer Republics have a right to self-determination, we will fight for that right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT6060OPTB;This isn't out fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_namibia_desc;The sparsely inhabited lands of Namibia to our North-West have begun to attract the attention of the Great Powers, and we may soon find an aggressive colonial power moving in next door. It is critical for the maintenance of our national security that we take this area to prevent this.

kruger_wildlife_preserve_desc;In 1895, Jakob Louis van Wyk introduced in the Volksraad of $COUNTRY$, a motion to create the game reserve which would become the Kruger National Park. That motion, introduced together with another Volksraad member by the name of R. K. Loveday, and accepted for discussion in September 1895 by a majority of one vote, resulted in the proclamation by Paul Kruger president of the Transvaal Republic, on 26 March 1898, of a "Government Wildlife Park." This park would later be known as the Sabi Game Reserve and was expanded into the Kruger National Park in 1926.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the Cape Qualified Franchise emerged in $YEAR$ when the Cape Colony received representative government and elected its first parliament. It made it so that people with proof of a relatively low sum of 25 pounds at the time could vote, making it so the majority of the population of South Africa had voting rights and excluding only the poorest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18531887;Racism on the Rise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18531887;\n\nFrom 1853, the Cape Colony, known now as the Western Cape, had a representative democracy that granted suffrage to all men regardless of color. However, beginning in 1887, the British colonialists began to change voting laws in order to impede black votes. It seems like our white population have become increasingly racist and if we don't comply to their demands, they might get angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
