switch_to_vernacular_chinese_title;Over the course of several millenia, literary and vernacular Chinese have diverged greatly from each other, making it so the words and phrases in our greatest works differ wholly from those spoken by the common person on the street. This wide gap poses a significant obstacle to our objective of reaching full literacy as soon as possible드s well as our ultimate objective of fully modernizing China드nd it is time that we reformed written Chinese to match vernacular Chinese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

simplify_chinese_title;Although we have managed to convince most to write in vernacular over literary Chinese, many Chinese characters are still overly complex and difficult to learn. Furthermore, many separate individuals have made various casual simplifications of various characters, leading to continued disparity between the overly formalistic literary Chinese and the Chinese that is used in practice. It is time that we collated and added to these simplifications, so that Chinese may become ever more accessible to the common people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600000;Over the course of several millenia, literary and vernacular Chinese have diverged듮his state of affairs has greatly hindered our efforts to promote literacy amongst the peasantry, who form the bulk of our nation. Although some minor efforts have been made in past centuries to shift towards vernacular Chinese듮he language spoken by the people in everyday matters듧iterary Chinese has managed to cling on via the conservatism of the old Qing court and the landlords. However, following the overthrow of the Qing, writers, artists, and intellectuals have began to critize various components of traditional Chinese society, one of which was literary Chinese. Although the process was long and difficult, we have managed to achieve the widespread adoption of vernacular Chinese by the literate portions of our population, simplifying and fully unifying our language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600001;For millenia, the Chinese script has slowly been standardized and simplified from its pictographic origins through the efforts of countless reformers. However, most characters remained clunky, unwieldy, and overly complex, and severely our efforts to encourage literacy. Considering that China is a nation of many hundreds of millions드nd that most of these hundreds of millions were barely able of recognizing their own names in writing들t is clear that we had to do something to facilitate education, and that something was to simplify our writing system.\n\nDescribed as both 'the greatest writer Asia produced in the 20th century' and 'the saint of modern China,' the author Lu Xun once said that "if Chinese characters are not destroyed, then China will die," and we have taken that suggestion to heart.Combining informal simplifications made in years past that were not widely adopted, as well as a multitude of suggestions from our Language Reform Committee, we have successfully simplified 515 characters and 54 components, the latter of which are found in countless other common characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
