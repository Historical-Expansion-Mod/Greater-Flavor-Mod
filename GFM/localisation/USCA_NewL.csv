EVTNAME262627;Constitutional debates;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262627;The Constitution of Francisco Morazán still did not come into force in 1835 because of the opposition of conservatives and the parochial position of liberal leaders who did not want to infringe on their rights. Now, after dealing with renegades, in $YEAR$ Federal Congress has been convened again to reform our Constitution consolidating territorial arrangement, Mr. president, what is your last word?;;;;;;;
EVT262627OPTA;Federalism is the only way! Viva la FRCA!;;;;;;
EVT262627OPTB;Begin the process to concentrate political power in strong unitary government.;;;;;;
EVT262627OPTC;We can not hold our territories in single union, so only confederation can save us.;;;;;;
EVTNAME262628;Bay Islands cores;;;;;;
EVTDESC262628;«In 1821, when the Central American provinces achieved their independence, the islands were under the jurisdiction of the state of Honduras. This state of things continued until May, 1830, when the superintendent of the British establishment of Belize, as a measure of coercion against the republic, which had refused to surrender certain runaway slaves, made a descent on Roatan and seized it on behalf of the British crown. The federal authorities remonstrated, and the act was disavowed by the British government». Finally, we have solved our internal problems and can think about the cores on these islands. Are we brave enough to challenge the Queen of the Seas?;;;;;;;;
EVT262628OPTA;We have same claims as Honduras!;;;;;;;;
EVT262628OPTB;We do not need international conflict because of these small islands.;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME262630;The rise of coffee;;;;;;
EVTDESC262630;Coffee was first cultivated in El Salvador for domestic use early in the 19th century. By mid-century its commercial promise was evident, and the government began to favor its production through legislation such as tax breaks for producers, exemption from military service for coffee workers, and elimination of export duties for new producers. Moreover Adolf von Baeyer, the German chemist, described his synthesis of indigo in 1880, and now more chemists are trying to find the way to synthesize indigo dye in industrial mass. \n Although in comparison with Indigofera, coffee is a more demanding crop. Since coffee bushes required several years to produce a usable harvest, its production required a greater commitment of capital, labor, and land than did indigo. Coffee also grew best at a certain altitude, whereas indigo flourished almost anywhere.;;;;;;;
EVT262630OPTA;Let us switch to coffee!;;;;;;;;;
EVT262630OPTB;Natural will always be better than synthetic.;;;;;;;
