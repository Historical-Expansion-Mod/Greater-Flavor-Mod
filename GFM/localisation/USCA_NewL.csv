EVTDESC262626;The rebels have been defeated and finally we control all parts of our glorious republic.

Although, after heavy fighting we need to move forward and it is rumoring about imminent adoption of a new Constitution which defines the future of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

usca_constitution_desc;The harsh civil war has ended and we should learn from our mistakes, so that Federation will not be on the verge of disintegration once again. It is essential to amend the Constitution or even adopt the new one. Fate of the Republic in our hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262627;The Constitution of Francisco Morazán still did not come into force in 1835 because of the opposition of conservatives and the parochial position of liberal leaders who did not want to infringe on their rights. Now, after dealing with renegades, in $YEAR$ Federal Congress has been convened again to reform our Constitution consolidating territorial arrangement, Mr. president, what is your last word?;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262628;«In 1821, when the Central American provinces achieved their independence, the islands were under the jurisdiction of the state of Honduras. This state of things continued until May, 1830, when the superintendent of the British establishment of Belize, as a measure of coercion against the republic, which had refused to surrender certain runaway slaves, made a descent on Roatan and seized it on behalf of the British crown. The federal authorities remonstrated, and the act was disavowed by the British government». Finally, we have solved our internal problems and can think about the cores on these islands. Are we brave enough to challenge the Queen of the Seas?;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC262630;Coffee was first cultivated in El Salvador for domestic use early in the 19th century. By mid-century its commercial promise was evident, and the government began to favor its production through legislation such as tax breaks for producers, exemption from military service for coffee workers, and elimination of export duties for new producers. Moreover Adolf von Baeyer, the German chemist, described his synthesis of indigo in 1880, and now more chemists are trying to find the way to synthesize indigo dye in industrial mass. \n Although in comparison with Indigofera, coffee is a more demanding crop since coffee bushes require several years to produce a usable harvest, its production requires a greater commitment of capital, labor, and land than does indigo. Coffee also grows best at certain altitudes, whereas indigo flourishes almost anywhere.;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262631;Our northern neighbor, Mexico, dreams of regaining control of "their" lands in Central America. Thus, in 1822, the first president of the USCA Gabino Gaínza, having failed to cope with the separatists in El Salvador, let the Mexicans in voluntarily. We are now independent, but our richest provinces, Guatemala and El Salvador, are in close proximity to the border and enemy can quickly occupy them. There is no better time than right now for decisive action - Mexico is busy with problems with its own northern territories and we can send them an ultimatum to transfer control over the Chiapas and Tabasco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262632;We received an ultimatum from the USCA on the transfer of the Chiapas and Tabasco. In case of refusal, we are threatened with war. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC262634;Mexico refused to hand over control of Chiapas and Tabasco! We are left with no choice but to send troops. Or?..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262635;Before dying, Morasan wished to be buried in El Salvador, the capital of the Federation he cherished. However, the leaders of the rest of the provinces opposed this and everyone considered their territory to be worthy to hold the remains of a great man. We do not have the opportunity to find a compromise, but we must make a choice that, in fact, will designate our capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
