EVTNAME262626; Victory in the civil war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262626; The rebels have been defeated and finally we control all parts of our glorious republic. Francisco Morazán has proved with fire and sword what would happen with separatists and enemies of the Federation. Although, after heavy fighting we need to move forward and it is rumoring about imminent adoption of a new Constitution which defines the future of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT262626OPTA; What the future holds for us?..;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME262627; Constitutional debates;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC262627; The Constitution of Francisco Morázan still did not come into force in 1835 because of the opposition of conservatives and the parochial position of liberal leaders who did not want to infringe on their rights. Now, after dealing with renegades, in $YEAR$ Federal Congress has been convened again to reform our Constitution consolidating territorial arrangement, Mr. president, what is your last word?;;;;;;;
EVT262627OPTA; Federalism is the only way! Viva la FRCA!;;;;;;
EVT262627OPTB; Begin the process to concentrate political power in strong unitary government.;;;;;;

EVTNAME262628; Bay Islands cores;;;;;;
EVTDESC262628; "In 1821, when the Central American provinces achieved their independence, the islands were under the jurisdiction of the state of Honduras. This state of things continued until May, 1830, when the superintendent of the British establishment of Belize, as a measure of coercion against the republic, which had refused to surrender certain runaway slaves, made a descent on Roatan and seized it on behalf of the British crown. The federal authorities remonstrated, and the act was disavowed by the British government". Finally, we have solved our internal problems and can think about the cores on these islands. Are we brave enough to challenge the Queen of the Seas?;;;;;;;;
EVT262628OPTA; We have same claims as Honduras!;;;;;;;;
EVT262628OPTB; We do not need international conflict because of these small islands.;;;;;;;;;
