1833_reforms_title;The Reforms of 1833;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833_reforms_desc;President ValentÃ­n Gomez Farias has proposed several social, political and economic reforms to curb the power of the Catholic Church in Mexico. Liberals compare the clergy to ministers of Huitzilopochtli (who received human sacrifices), accusing them of being being worldly, greedy hypocrites. They see the Bible as full of absurdities and falsehoods from an ignorant era and wish to disempower the pope. Conservatives are furious about the proposals and the disrespect to the church, seeing them as reason to depose Farias.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME183536;Las Siete Leyes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183536;Our president's government has issued a new constitution called the 'Siete Leyes'. It replaces the constitution of 1824 and establishes the Centralist Republic of Mexico, a unitary state, strengthening the government in Mexico City. The federal system was originally implemented to emulate the success of the US, but evidently, as seen by the political turmoil and civil wars our country has experienced in the last decade, it has not been very effective. Thus, the conservative government, seeking to further its control over the states, has proclaimed the federal system to have been a mistake and brought Mexico into an era of unitarianism. How fruitful this reform will turn out to be remains to be seen, as federalism has many fierce defenders who now plot to overthrow the central authority in Mexico City.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183536;Viva México!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME183637;Separatist Movements Arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183637;Using the opportunity granted by the recent political instability and conflict amongst liberals and conservatives, the Texans have declared independence with significant support from the Americans. While the rebels aim to secede, achieve self-determination and escape the government in Mexico City, the desire to preserve the institution of slavery is certainly a significant factor. Though slavery has been illegal in Mexico many years, immigrants from the US who settled in Texas have been practicing it illegally and want to ensure the security of their plantations by forming their own republic that explicitly allows slavery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183637;Fight those rebels! Defend the constitution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB183637;This is hopeless. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTA;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTB;We shall surrender our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207010;The peoples in the south of our Kingdom are mainly Flemings and Walloons, Roman Catholics which are unhappy with how our government treats them, being subjugated by a mostly protestant north. Many liberals are claiming His Majesty King William I as a despotic ruler. Unemployment and industrial unrest in the working classes has also contributed to the turmoil. Riots have erupted in Brussels, shops looted, theatergoers joined the movement right after watching the nationalistic opera La muette de Portici. These rebels soon have started talking about secession and the States-General in Brussels voted in favor of secession and declared independence. It's time to decide what are we going to do about this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207011;We have gloriously defeated the Dutch! Our independence has been secured and the Kingdom of Belgium has been born! Now we can appoint Leopold I as King of the Belgians and establish an official government! Glory to Belgium! Glory to Flanders! Glory to Walloonia! Glory to the Kingdom of Belgium!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207012;The London Conference of $YEAR$ has been proclaimed. We have been invited to take a seat and discuss about the independence of Belgium. This is mostly a diplomatic settlement, as The Kingdom of Belgium is de facto independent. Nevertheless, we can get something from this, depending on what we choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207027;The State of Zacatecas has rebelled against the increasingly authoritarian grip of the Mexico City government. Ongoing efforts by the conservatives to abolish federalism and introduce a new unitarian constitution have led Francisco García Salinas, the governor of Zacatecas, to begin a revolt in the hopes of toppling the dictatorship. He has already assembled a small army of about four thousand men and hopes to eventually march on the capital. To suppress the rebellion, General Santa Anna has headed to Zacatecas with an army to handle the situation himself, leaving General Miguel Barragán as president in the meantime. §GIf you win as the revolt, you get good reforms and avoid 2 future revolts. If you white peace as the revolt, you get an inferior version of the aforementioned.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_securalization_law_title;The Secularization Law of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_securalization_law_desc;The Congress of the Union has proposed an Act to secularize all Californian missions, transferring ownership form the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church to the Mexican authorities, this is because of potential Spanish influence and power in California because most Spanish missions in California are still loyal to the Roman Catholic Church in Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GUERREROTRUCE;Following our recent victories in our revolt, we have forced the centralist government of Bustamante to step down and sign an armistice! This is great news for our cause, as we are able to begin implementing reforms and bettering the nation. At the same time, we have not defeated the conservative establishment hostile to our aims, and, as per the terms of the armistice, we must attempt to find middle ground with them in the provisional government to come. Nobody is under any illusions concerning the sustainability of this solution: While the hatchet has been buried for the moment, a resumption of the civil war is a question not of if, but of when. §RAnother civil war will occur in two years time, when the modifiers added by this event expire.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207031;Our glorious victory against the central government has restored Vicente Guerrero to the presidency! Mexico has entered a new period of progress and reform, yet all is not well. Guerrero's plans to institute and enforce equal treatment of Afro-Mexicans and Indians, as well as his unshakable democratic spirit have made him an enemy of the conservative land-holding elites and the clergy, not to mention the current corrupt civil administration. The new government will struggle to implement reforms, let alone function at all, making it provisional in nature. It is clear that conflict will soon again erupt between Guerrero and the conservative establishment. §RAnother civil war will occur in two years time, when the modifiers added by this event expire.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207030;In what many call 'the single most shocking event in the history of Mexico', Vicente Guerrero has been captured in Acapulco through an act of betrayal. The general and hero of the war of independence was lured onto a boat by Italian merchant ship captain Francisco Picaluga, who had invited him for a meal. Picaluga swiftly took Guerrero prisoner and sailed to Huatulco, where he turned him over to federal troops. Following a mock trial in the city of Oaxaca, he has now been executed by a government firing squad. While this ends the movement to restore Guerrero to the presidency, the treacherous and brutal methods used have angered liberals throughout the nation. General Bustamante has secured his hold on the presidency for the moment, but his base of support continues to erode. Further political violence continues to be not a question of if, but when.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207028;After we were victorious in Spain's last attempt to reconquer Mexico in 1829, Anastasio Bustamante was put in charge of a reserve army which he used to revolt against president Vicente Guerrero. The revolt succeeded and Bustamante was recognized as president of the republic by congress today. Several deputies and liberal members of congress are furious at this, for in their view, Vicente Guerrero is the rightful legal president and in his absense, vice president José María Bocanegra should assume the presidency temporarily, meaning that Bustamante is a usurper. Guerrero, a man of indigenous and Afro-Mexican heritage, enjoys great support among many peasants, as he abolished slavery during his term and defended Mexico from Spain's last attempt at reconquest at the Battle of Tampico. After being deposed by the Mexico City garrison, he has fled to the South and has begun gathering forces to retake Mexico City.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207029;Liberal general Juan José Codallos has risen up against Anastasio Bustamante's authoritarian presidency, organizing a rebel army in the West. Codallos has issued a proclamation with eleven articles, the most important of which is the restoration of Vicente Guerrero as the president of the Mexican Republic. The rebels are already on the move, taking hold of much of our western coast. Guerrero has gathered quite a force from his base of support in the western regions of Costa Grande and Tierra Caliente. It was this very area of mixed race population that already had Guerrero's back during the war of independence against Spain. It will certainly not be easy to dislodge him. §GIf you win as the revolt, you get reforms, if you white peace as the revolt, you get similar stuff but worse. Wipe out Mexico's armies and capture Mexico City to win!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUERRERODEFEAT;General Santa Anna stands victorious, having defeated Guerrero using the support of his powerful allies among the land-holding elites and the clergy. They have seized power in Mexico City and expelled Guerrero's reformist cabinet. With his rivals' forces broken and on the run, General Santa Anna has now assumed the presidency and reverted Guerrero's reforms. Unseating him and his allies from their new position of power will prove to be a difficult task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUERREROTRIUMPH;President Vicente Guerrero has routed the rebellious armies and sent the treacherous General Santa Anna into exile. Now that his enemies' forces scattered and leaderless, those who rallied them, namely the conservative land-holders and the clergy are now defenseless. Guerrero has achieved total and final victory, and the power of his conservative rivals has been destroyed. Never again will they be able to take arms against him. With the opposition soundly defeated, Mexico has entered a new era of reforms. President Guerrero has now embarked on his program of equality, democracy and industrialization, and the future is bright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALTERNATEVERACRUZ;The provisional government was never meant to last. With President Guerrero seeking far-reaching reforms going beyond anything seen before in Mexico, including enforcing equal treatment of Indians and Afro-Mexicans, instituting universal voting and embarking on an ambitious program of industrialization, all compromise was out of the window. The conservative land-holding elites, the Catholic clergy and the campesinos loyal to them have rallied behind General Antonio López de Santa Anna. He has proclaimed the Plan of Veracruz, beginning a rebellion to depose Guerrero from the presidency and restore the power of the conservative elites. Santa Anna enjoys support from much of the army, and we will be hard pressed to defeat him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207033;Antonio López de Santa Anna, Anastasio Bustamante and Manuel Gómez Pedraza have signed an agreement in Puebla, dubbed 'The Zavaleta Conventions'. Under this treaty, Manuel Gómez Pedraza, a staunch liberal, has assumed the presidency of Mexico, restoring the constitutional order. The republican and federal systems are now re-empowered. While liberals across our country breathe a sigh of relief, the conservatives are morose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207032;Mexico has been suddenly wrought asunder by a devastating civil war. The instigators are the officers of the fort garrisons of Veracruz and San Juan de Ulúa who plot to re-establish the 1824 Federal Constitution. Their goal is to overthrow president Anastasio Bustamante and his conservative government to install Antonio López de Santa Anna as vice president with the liberals taking over the ministries and presidency to reverse the perceived damage done to our country by the conservatives. Although the officers are the leaders of the civil war, Santa Anna is the true covert mastermind at the root of it. The rebels initiated the civil war by capturing a convoy loaded with money, ammunition and supplies. This has given them the material they needed to sustain their forces. The garrisons of Toluca, Tejupilco, Puebla, Guanajuato, Querétaro, Michoacán, Tlaxcala, Jalisco, Acapulco, Oaxaca and Aguascalientes have all joined the rebellion. §GThe revolt wins if it captures Mexico City.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4208033;President Anastasio Bustamante has, against all odds, won the civil war and put an end to the Veracruz Plan. The subdued liberals have been scattered while the ruling conservatives stand stronger and more united than ever. Now, nothing is in the way of centralizing our nation -- an action the government is already preparing for by slowly reducing the autonomy of federal states. Full unitarianism is soon to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207034;Manuel GÃ³mez Pedraza's liberal reforms and anti-catholic rhetoric have infuriated the god-fearing religious people of Mexico. Using this uproar to move against Pedraza's government, Santa Anna was proclaimed as 'Protector of the Catholic Religion' and 'Sustainer of Religion and the Patriotic Liberties' by the clergy. With support from the church and the masses at its command, Santa Anna, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a and JosÃ© Mariano Campos have proclaimed the Plan of Cuernavaca in the namesake town. They demand that the anti-ecclesiastic reforms be reversed and that Santa Anna be made president. More than 100 towns have already declared their support for the Plan of Cuernavaca. Santa Anna has published a manifesto to the people to gather further support in which he states that he is defending the wishes of the people by defending Catholicism and that he had 'implored' congress to end their anti-catholic policies -- to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207061;The public has been roused to rage over the restrictions on their movement as cholera has hit Russia. Protesting forced quarantine and armed cordons, they have stormed the streets, raiding the homes of gentry as well as police departments and hospitals. They have even attacked politicians themselves, such as Tambov's mayor, even though the Russian army has driven them back. Unrest over this slight inconvenience to their daily lives has spread from St. Petersburg to Sevastopol. Don't people want to stay healthy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207062;A rally organized by the National Union of the Working Classes today, set on open ground behind London's Coldbath Fields prison, devolved into chaos and violence. What started as a protest against the establishment of the new police force and for increased voting rights beyond those granted by the Reform Act of 1832 soon grew acrimonious when police arrived, declaring the protest an illegal gathering. It is not known whether the police or the rioters escalated the confrontation, but soon the officers led several baton charges against the crowd, and three officers were stabbed, one fatally. Thankfully, few crowd members were seriously injured. \n\nWho knows what will come of radical liberals and the direction they are hoping to steer our country in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BALTIMOREBANKRIOT;The Bank of Maryland has suddenly closed alongside several financial institutions in the state, leading to thousands of Marylanders losing millions in savings. \n\nIn response, a riot has broken out in Baltimore, growing first from a small mob that approached the home of Senator Revendy Johnson, who also directs the Bank, and broke its windows. Mobs returned on multiple consecutive days to further trash the house, even as Baltimore mayor Jesse Hunt attempted to placate them. It is continuously straining the city's resources to stop their rioting--their demand for their money back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SNOWRIOT;A lynch mob descended on the Epicurean Eating House in Washington D.C. today, a restaurant owned by a freed black man, as part of larger anti-abolitionist riots in the capital. Draped by the tension over the slavery debate and Nat Turner's recent rebellion, white folk were excited to unrest over having to compete with free blacks for jobs. This, in turn, led to the Epicurean Eating House being trashed and its owner, Beverly Snow, killed. Yet the rioters would not relent, and it would take direct intervention from the army on the President's orders to disperse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
