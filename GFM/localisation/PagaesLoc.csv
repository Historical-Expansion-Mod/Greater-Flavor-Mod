accept_belarussians_title;Grant Equal Rights to the White Ruthenians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_belarussians_desc;While far from our height many centuries ago, our recent conquest of White Ruthenia puts our nation in a peculiar position. Even if there were always Slavs in our nation after our independence, now, with the inclusion of our old territories, the White Ruthenians became a sizeable portion of our population, with our people becoming a minority in our own nation. Now, our ministers suggest that the best course of action would be to, instead of letting our peoples fight against each other within our own borders, we should integrate the people of White Ruthenia in our nation, granting them equal rights to Lithuanians and finding unity in our shared history under foreign rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502013;\n\nAfter achieving our independence from the Russians, the Baltic Landtag would hand over power to the military as a temporary measure as our nation started to function as a modern, independent state. But now, as the anniversary of our independence comes near, protests started to appear, with voices asking for more representation and for the army to step down, calling our government "The Landtag of Steel". At first, the unrest was easy to deal with, but as people went to the streets again and again, with even bigger numbers each time. Our ministers advise that if we don't act now, we risk losing control the situation and risking our control over the entire Baltic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502014;\n\nBeing the most recent addition to the Baltic State, Lithuania had already a pretty sizeable independence movement mobilized. With unrest getting more and more out of control, a bunch of proeminent Lithuanian figures declared independence from us and most of our lithunian troops already defected to this new state. While our first instinct is to kill this new Lithuanian nation right out of its craddle, we have been advised by some of our generals that mobilizing against Lithuania would put our other territories open to further rebellion. Thus, it may be a good idea to let Lithuania go for now, lest we lose Estonia or even Latvia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502015;\n\nAfter a tense week of protests in Estonia, we received news that Estonia has been taken by complete chaos, with local regiments mutinying against of rule and joining the calls for representation and independence. It seems that we have completely lost control over Estonia, with drafts of an independence declaration already being writen in Reval. With the lost of most Estonian regiments in our army, we are presented with two options, to either cross into Estonia and try put down their dreams of an independent state or to know that, for now, Estonia and lost and all we can do is to try to crush any dissent in Latvia with the troops that haven't deserted us yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502016;\n\nEven after being able to hold Latvia for so long, lost control over most of it. The countryside has long been prone to attacks from guerrilla, but now the Latvian masses have taken control over most major cities, with our Latvian brigades in open mutiny and some of our German troops finding themselves cut off from the government in our capital. We have barely managed to hold Riga, with most of the acess to the city being closed, with the city under martial law. With most of the country falling into enemy hands, we hear about Latvia declaring formal independence in Mitau. The Landtag was called to an emergency session to decide between our options, to fight to our last man, to capitulate to the Latvians or to bunker up in Riga and ask for German help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502017;\n\nOur diplomats in Riga have been watching over the situation in the Baltic State as the German government in ther slowly lost control over their territories that once hailed them as liberators. Talks about the slow dissolution of the Baltic State were a hot topic over in our capital, both between our politicians and generals. While our government would have been happy to intervene and save our baltic brothers at any moment, the truth is that the Baltic State acted with inaction and just did nothing as their state slowly collapsed. Now after Latvia declaring independence, what is left of the Baltic government in Riga asked for our protection, offering us control over most of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502018;\n\nEven if we were reduced to Germany puppet, at least with their help we managed to get our land back and be worthy of being considerd more than a city-state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502019;\n\nAs the Sun rose, it was a quiet morning in the Baltic State. After fighting a war agianst itself, the Baltic State finally had a day that no shot was fired and no blood was shed. It was a well deserved morning, after all turmoil, normalcy has finally returned to the Baltic, even if that is not to say that nothing changed. The message was clear for everyone, after quelling revolts all over the country, dissent would not be tolerated and the Germans were here to stay. That was clear when looking at the Baltic Military, once being an army composed from Germans and Baltic natives, after many desertions and purges it became mostly a German force, with non-Germans serving as auxiliaries. Most foreign observers have noted that the Baltic Army became quite a formidable force, that will not hesitate to put down any new revolt that dares to show its ugly head. In the end, the Baltic people that fought for independence have traded their old Russian overlords for German ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GER_sway_the_baltic_title;The Baltic Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_sway_the_baltic_desc;With our victory in the Baltic, our new allies in the East soon will have to choose how their new nation will be governed. As the guarantors of their independence, we naturally hold a great deal of influence with them, being offered to send representatives to the upcoming meeting in Riga. We should decide what will be our agenda in Riga and in which direction we will sway their decision into.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502020;\n\nAs we decide how to influence our new Baltic allies, some questions emerge on how to influence their future government. Some very vocal voices tell us to take every step to turn them into our puppet, but we probably should act with caution, lest we alienate our new and valuable ally. One of the more reasonable options has been to send the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, an ally of ours that has been invited to bid for the throne by Baltic Monarchists. Furthermore, parts of our delegation recommend instead that we send some liberal agitators to the Baltic to create a more liberal German state to relieve us from unrest. And last but not least, we could send some envoys to their military, suggesting them to take power, for a time, of course...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_strike_first_title;Declare of Baltic Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_strike_first_desc;With the consolidation of Baltic administration and our underhand deal with Berlin struck, we are starting to take steps to make sure Russia can't curtail Baltic autonomy. Our people got in contact with Latvian and Estonian leaders, to talk about the possibility of Baltic independence, and for the nation to stay united as a state of Germans, Latvians and Estonians. Not only did we manage to strike a deal with their leadership, but they also offered to get in contact with some Latvians and Estonians in Dinaburg and Pechory to have them rise up and join the Baltic struggle for independence. Now, with everything ready, all that is left is to cast the die and depose our Russian overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_claim_ingria_desc;§RGain 12.5 infamy§! When the Baltic was first conquered from Sweden, Peter the Great of Russia handed the ruling of the Baltic to his, very corrupt, right-hand man and governor of Ingria. While he fell from the position even before the governorates were properly established, with our position in the Baltic and independence from Russia secured, the ambitions of our state grew, and Ingria became subject to the interest of war hawks and jingoists alike. With our independence, the Russian government has formally declared the transfer of the Imperial Capital from Saint Petersburg to Moscow, undoing Peter the Great's work, with some arguing that now would be the perfect time to claim Ingria. If we were to seize Ingria and St. Petersburg, we would be pretty much expelling Russia from the Baltic Sea, forever tarnishing the legacy their tsars fought to build.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31502022;\n\nThroughout the cities of Vilnius, Riga and Reval, massive crowds had turned out in celebration of the expulsion of Russians from their region! After wrestling their freedom from the maw of the Russian Bear, the Baltics are finally free after almost two centuries of Russian dominance. Today, the Baltic people put aside their differences to relish in their newfound freedom and independence from foreign rule. Though celebratory, the Baltic people remain worried that Moscow will attempt to reconquer the region. Despite the future threats from Moscow, the Baltics have achieved self-determination that will never be vanquished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

unite_poland_galicia_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§! Despite being once a great state in Eastern Europe, after being partitioned time and time again, the Polish people were divided between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Now, with our significant influence in Polish lands, we could not only partially right this wrong, but also strengthen our Polish allies by pushing to unite Poland with Galicia-Lodomeria, while also taking the opportunity to solve some minor claims the Polish have on us. While the Polish people sure will appreciate the unification, the other powers won't be pleased to see us redrawing Eastern Europe in such a way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_duchy_estonia_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! While we were considered by many as a power in decline after the Napoleonic Wars and the loss of Norway, it has become clear that those years of humiliation are behind us. As our nation is once again respected on the world stage, it would only be natural that we start looking into old claims that we could use to solidify our newfound position and prestige. One of the bolder suggestions circulating within our government is that of the Estonian claim. Not only because we held it as a duchy for about a century, but also due to the importance of Estonia in regard to our history - with the legend about the origins of the Dannebog, our flag, in the Battle of Lindanise, during the Livonian Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

subdue_baltic_desc;With our recent defeats in the Baltic, we took a significant blow to our international status. The annexation of the Baltic in the Great Northern War under Peter the Great centuries ago elevated Russia into a true European power and, while the loss of the Baltic won't undermine our position as major player in European politics, we can't deny that it left a sour taste in our mouths. To remedy that, we could reassert our position in the Baltic Sea and claim that the Baltic states do not deserve independence and are still an integral part of our territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC49511A;\n\nWith our increased influence in Scandinavia, the matter of the North Atlantic Islands has increasibly come to the attention of our government. While Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands were awarded to Denmark after the loss of Norway in 1814, they are now under our indirect control. This has prompted some of our advisors to suggest that we should take direct control of them, thus ensuring that we would retain absolute control over the North Atlantic in the event of our Scandinavian allies breaking away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49512A;\n\nOur new overlords have moved to seize Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_greece_title;Unite Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_greece_desc;Ever since the end of the Byzantine Empire, the Greek people have never been unified into a single nation. While Attica and Peloponnese managed to be part of the new Greek nation, Greeks in the Aegean sea and Anatolia weren't so lucky, even if some of them recently managed to free themselves from Turkish overlordship. Now, with our control over Greece, the Greek people of the Aegean and Anatolia are skeptical of joining Greece, wary of our presence in the country. But, if we managed to increase our influence in these new states we could, in theory, make so their governments agree to join our Greek vassals, letting our puppet grow in strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC84205832;\n\nWith our recent victories in the Caucasus against the Circassians and Dagestanis, our governance of the region came into question. While our "divide and conquer" strategies have been quite effective, the advisors to the Tsar have long since talked about how the Caucasus Namestnik needs some more oversight, with charges of corruption and incompetence being present since the we first left Karl Knorring in charge of the region. Now the question stands, should we further integrate the Namestnik, or should we let our viceroys have autonomy to expand the Russian hold in the region?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ITA_create_yugoslavia_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! The Balkans have always been a playground for foreign empires. As we strive to prove ourselves as a true great power in Europe, we seek a sphere of influence of our own, with the Balkans emerging as the most promising target. By expanding our influence in the region, we can strip the Austrians and Turks of territory while creating allies who will be forever indebted to us, securing our place as the Masters of the Adriatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RUS_create_yugoslavia_desc;§RGain 8 infamy§! The Balkans have always been a playground for foreign empires. Populated by South Slavic peoples, the region naturally falls within our sphere of influence, with many viewing us as brothers and liberators due to our role in freeing them from the Ottoman Empire. If we were to complete the liberation of the South Slavic people from the Ottoman and Austrian Empires, we could not only create a powerful ally but also gain access to a route that bypasses the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, allowing us to establish a naval presence in the Mediterranean Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS_create_yuguslavia_title;Quelling the Powder Keg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS_create_yuguslavia_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! The Balkans have always been a playground for foreign empires, including ourselves. We have long held an interest in the region, demonstrated by our control over Croatia and our rivalry with the Ottomans. While we have previously stated that we hold no interest in further expansion, the rise of nationalism has turned the Balkans into a powder keg waiting to explode. If we were to reassert our position, we might be able to organize the region in a way that quells the nationalist fires threatening to destabilize our empire in the future - even if it means angering Russia in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800800;\n\nAs our position in the Balkans is secured, our troops move into the region and prepare to enforce the new borders being drawn in $CAPITAL$. Now, all that remains is to decide how we want the borders of the region to look. The only certainty is that we are to take control of Dalmatia and Vlorë and that there is to be a South Slavic state. However, the size of this nation remains a matter of discussion, as we may wish to strip it of some territory to make the region easier to control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800801;\n\nAs our position in the Balkans is secured, our troops move into the region and prepare to enforce the new borders being drawn in $CAPITAL$. Now, all that remains is to decide how we want the borders of the region to look. While most of our advisors and supporters favor a strong South Slavic state, it may be in our best interest to break it up into smaller states so that they are easier to control while still remaining loyal allies in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800802;\n\nWith the separation of Bulgaria from Belgrade, the matter of Macedonia has come to our attention. The region is a melting pot of Serbian, Bulgarian, and Albanian peoples and is claimed by both our new allies in Belgrade and by Bulgaria. Both parties have requested that we grant them definitive control over the region, which contains the port of Solun — a vital asset we plan to use to bypass the straits that confine us to the Black Sea. While the region has traditionally been part of Bulgaria, we could grant it to Belgrade as compensation for the loss of Bulgaria itself and other territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800803;\n\nAs our position in the Balkans is secured, our troops move into the region and prepare to enforce the new borders being drawn in $CAPITAL$. Now, all that remains is to decide how we want the borders of the region to look. Our plan is to annex Bosnia and then create a nominal South Slavic state by uniting Serbia and Montenegro under our supervision - turning a potential enemy into a permanent ally. Some of our advisors have even suggested annexing Belgrade and Montenegro outright, leaving Yugoslavia with only Serbia, with the possibility of integrating Bulgaria into it at a later stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_annex_sardinia_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Ever since our hegemony over Italy was established, our nation has only benefited — diplomatically, by having the entire peninsula as our ally, and economically, through French investors dominating Italy’s mines and factories. One such place is Sardinia. With its profitable mines and proximity to French Corsica, our investors have taken control of most of the economy on this otherwise isolated island. As a result, there has been growing outcry in Paris over the idea of annexing the island to secure its valuable resources. However, that is not to say the proposal has gone unopposed—many advisors argue that Sardinia has long been isolated from the rest of Italy and has a strong history of resisting outside influence. Still, our far-reaching economic presence may be a promising sign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800804;\n\nFollowing the crushing defeat by the French and the Treaty of New York, as if the loss of Louisiana was not enough, the French have also demanded that Texas and California join their puppet government in Mexico City, effectively restoring Mexico to its pre-1836 borders before the loss of Texas and the Mexico-American War. \n\nThe only positive outcome is that the Anglo-Canadians have petitioned to join the Union as the state of Ontario - we will certainly need their help in reclaiming our destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1316087;\n\nWhile we were aware of the Sino-Japanese war happening to our south, our advisors believed that Imperial China would deal a significant blow to Japan's territorial ambition, but the Japanese have shocked the world by emerging triumphant. In the aftermath of their victory, Japan has imposed on China the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which not only ends Korea's status as a Chinese vassal, but also cedes to Japan the island of Formosa and—more importantly—the Liaodong Peninsula, in Manchuria. \n\nThese developments pose a severe threat to our own interests in Manchuria. To resolve this, we could leverage support from Paris and Berlin to demand the Japanese withdraw from Liaodong, preventing their further encroachment on our sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316088;\n\nWhile our triumph over China is indeed an awe-inspiring feat, the resultant rising of our country to a regional powerhouse has not pleased some of our neighbors—notably the Russians. Today, we received a message from Russia demanding our withdrawal from the Liaodong Peninsula, threatening a multi-national coalition if we do not comply—hinting that the other great powers have pledged military support. While we were always wary of Russian ambition in the Far East, we did not imagine that a potential war would with them would come so quickly. Some of our advisors suggest we call their bluff and refuse to withdraw from Liaodong, but others suggest we accept their demands,  which would in turn curry favor with the rest of the great powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316187;\n\nAs reports continue to arrive about the Japanese victory against China, we have received an envoy from the Russian Tsar, asking for our support in their intervention against Japan. Russia argues that if the treaty is not reverted by Japan either willingly or under threat of force, not only will their sphere of influence in the Far East be at stake, but our own presence in Asia as well. With the combined might of Russia, Germany and France, Japan is likely to back down. Russia would then be happy to return the favor by diplomatically supporting our colonial ambitions once this geopolitical tension ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316188;\n\nOur threat of intervention has been successful. Japan has agreed to return Liaodong to China and withdraw all its forces from Manchuria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316287;\n\nJapan has refused to withdraw from Liaodong, either believing our threats are insincere or that they can best our forces in battle. Whatever the reason for their insolence, we are prepared for war, and our allies are ready to join us once we make the call to arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316088;\n\nWe have been informed that Russia, not pleased with their southern island neighbors' encroachment into Manchuria, has forced Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula to us, with the only condition being that we pay Japan an additional 30 million taels in compensation. This is hardly an expense to us, considering the 200 million taels we already owe them as war reparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800806;\n\nAs our influence in the Far East grew and our need for expanding into warmer waters became clear, the concept of "Yellow Russia" started to form, first as to describe the mix of Russian and Asian culture in our far eastern territories and then, as China grew weaker and weaker, as a plan to expand into Chinese territory, especially Manchuria. Now, with Inner Manchuria under our direct control, we can finally consolidate the concept of Yellow Russia, with our advisors discussing if we should integrate Manchuria directly into our nation or let if be run by a viceroy to better manage this colonial project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

yellow_russia_gansu_desc;With our control over Xinjiang and Mongolia, we are almost reaching the final borders we planned for Zheltorossiya. What remains is to push through the Gansu province, so that our border follows the Yellow River. That would certainly make defense of the region easier, but contrary to the rest of Zheltorossiya, Gansu is densely populated, making it harder to control than the rest of Zheltorossiya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800805;\n\nAfter some initial outcry, it seems that Poland has calmed somewhat after the unrest caused by the massacre in Warsaw. However, it appears the Poles were drafting a proposal full of reforms to guarantee Poland’s security. The reforms are quite radical — calling for the restoration of Congress Poland and the Constitution of 1830, albeit with significant compromises meant to appease us and make it more difficult for Poland to rebel. \n\nNow, our advisors are now left to discuss these controversial proposals. Unsurprisingly, most of them have expressed deep distrust toward the Poles, but some have pointed out that restoring Poland could serve as a tool to undermine German control over regions such as Poznan and Galicia. In any case, this move by the Polish reveals a certain level of organization — indicating that there may be consequences if we ignore their their "suggestions".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800824;\n\nWith our hegemony over the Baltic, it has come to our attention that—while we have the government in Riga as a puppet—there is also Lithuania, the once-mighty Grand Duchy, now greatly reduced in size. Now that we hold significant influence over both states, we have a decision to consider. \n\nThere has been some discussion among our advisors regarding the region. One group supports recent requests from the government in Riga, asking us to hand Lithuania over to them. While this would undoubtedly strengthen Riga’s position, it would also increase their autonomy—even if they had to face some initial discontent from the Lithuanian population. On the other hand, a few advisors have pointed out that Lithuania, though diminished, could have its claims supported by us. This would allow us to significantly expand its territory, turning it into a valuable ally—one that remains firmly under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the pacification of the area now complete, our next step is to encourage Russian settlement—taking advantage of the vast expanses of fertile land in northern and eastern Kazakhstan, even at the cost of disrupting nomadic routes and driving the Kazakhs our of their traditional grazing pastures, leaving them open to be transformed into Russian farms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This does not mean, however, that the winds of German nationalism have subsided, on the contrary, it remains the most serious threat to our hold over the Confederation. To secure our dominance, we could assert control over the Federal Convention in Frankfurt, enabling us to shape legislation that would entrench—and even expand—our hegemony over Germany without opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are many states for us to consider, one of the most pressing ones would be the Rhineland. The lands along the Rhine have seen a significant boom in industrialization, which would greatly benefit our empire. Thus, we have put forth a proposal in the Federal Convention, to establish the Rhenish Industrial Commission which would, on paper,further boost industrialization in the Ruhr but, in reality, it would give us total control over the Rhenish affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are many states for us to consider, it recently came to our attention the matter of the duchy of Westphalia and the Hesse states. Westphalia has been under the control of a Habsburg noble ever since the end of the war against Prussia. But now, with our control over Frankfurt, we may change that. This time, one of our advisors has giving the idea of ordering the Duke of Westphalia to resign and partition his land between the states of Hesse, on the condition that they band together in the Union of Hesse-Westphalia and, of course, be loyal to us afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are many states to consider, it is time we turn our attention to the Free and Hanseatic Cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck. These cities aligned themselves with Prussia, giving us more than enough justification to simply incorporate them into Hanover and Mecklenburg. However, doing so would undoubtedly alienate many of the smaller states within the Confederation—most of which also sided with Prussia. Instead, we shall reform the Hanseatic League, uniting the three cities into a single state. This new entity will receive greater autonomy within the German Confederation, while still remaining subordinate to its executive authority—our emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are many states to consider, the matter of the Saxon states now calls for our attention. The Kingdom of Saxony has long been our ally, with the Austrian Emperor having protected it from annexation by Prussia during the Congress of Vienna. It is now time to reward Saxony and ensure it remains within our sphere of influence—by uniting Thuringia with its kingdom. In doing so, we not only reward Saxony for its loyalty but also grant it jurisdiction over the Thuringian duchies—most of which sided with Prussia during our war against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Duchy of Mecklenburg was an ally of Prussia, but there is no need to punish them. Instead, to guarantee their loyalty, we could unite them with the smaller Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, while also getting some concessions from them that would give us control over them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now that we hold control over the Federal Convention in Frankfurt, we can begin reorganizing Germany to secure our hegemony over the German Confederation. While there are many states to consider, an urgent matter is that of Brandenburg and Pomerania. Both states have been separated from Prussia and are currently under heavy oversight by both our Empire and the German Confederation. Needless to say, our control over the region is unstable—these lands were long held by the Hohenzollerns, and resistance to our rule is to be expected. Fortunately, one of our advisors has devised a plan: to forge a conspiracy suggesting that Brandenburg intends to return to Hohenzollern rule. This would provide us with the justification to declare martial law over both Brandenburg and Pomerania, allowing us to seize permanent control of the duchies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800825;\n\nWith our victory over Prussia, it has been reduced to little more than a rump state in the Baltic, a far cry from the days they were a contender for the throne of Germany. But, it seems that their situation is about to get worse. \n\nWith unrest brewing in Poland, the Polish population in Prussia seems to also have some strong desires for independence, as do the ones under Russian rule. But, seeing our treatment of the Polish people, a secretive delegation of Polish partisans from the province of Poznan has come to talk to us, asking for our support to start a Polish uprising in Greater Poland, promising to be loyal to us after their independence from Prussia, as long as they are granted some autonomy. Naturally, we were a bit skeptical of their offer, but they seem like a good opportunity to cripple the Prussians further, even if it will take some time for their revolt to actually start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800826;\n\nAs unrest brews in Russian Poland, it seems that we aren't immune to the growing Polish agitation. Much to the contrary, it would seem that, the Grand Duchy of Poznan, which is majority Polish, has followed the winds of Polish nationalism and declared independence from us, with the government in Vienna being the first to declare support to it. \n\nWe cannot overstate how much this hurts us. The loss of Poznan would mean the loss of a third of a remaining territory, but fighting against the uprising would mean fighting against the Austrians again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800827;\n\nWith the provisional government in Poznan being able to achieve their independence, our diplomats have already began talks with its representatives, the same which came to our capital months ago. Luckily, it seems that they are happy to follow through their end of the deal, letting us help "guide", especially in foreign affairs, turning them effectively into our puppet. Other than that, it is clear that the these revolutionaries have been emboldened by our support, suggesting us that they could even form a loyal government in Warsaw for a united Polish state, if the situation allows it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800828;\n\nWith the release of non-German lands from the Austrian Empire, it seems that there were left some loose ends by the Polish border. On the border, lies the city of Frauenstadt, known as Wadowice in Polish. The city, despite being part of the German Confederation, is still claimed by the Polish, with a significant Polish majority. Maybe it is for the better that we let the Polish have the city, to preserve relations with these newly established states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800829;\n\nAfter 300 years of Habsburg rule over Bohemia, it has become one of the richest regions of our Empire and even part of the first German Confederation, despite being a mostly Slavic region. It has been part of the German world for about 800 years, ever since the Holy Roman Empire, being one of its electors, being influenced by and even influencing Germany at some point, with Bohemian kings being elected Holy Roman Emperor for a time. But, despite these 800 years of contact with Germany, the Czechs remain mostly Slavic, with German being spoken mostly in Prag and the borderlands. \n\n Now, with the issue of Bohemia dominating the Federal Convention, it is time to decide: do we put our efforts into integrating Bohemia and its people despite the turmoil it may cause? Or do we save ourselves the hassle and finally let them go, granting them special autonomy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800830;\n\nAfter another triumphal victory against France, our troops occupy the most of the eastern bank of the Meuse. But, beyond the river, sits Belgium, a state meant to act as a buffer between us and France. Now, with another victory against the French, Belgium's existence as a buffer proves to hardly deter the conflict between our nations. Perhaps it is time that we end this little "Belgium Experiment" that has been ongoing to this day, either by separating Flanders from Wallonia or even taking Wallonia for ourselves and giving Flanders to the Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800831;\n\nYears after the Franco-Prussian War, we finally scored a triumphal victory against Germany! The Germans tried to take Lorraine from us, but ended up paying a heavy price for their hubris. While we could be happy with just Alsace-Loirrane, with such a victory, we can't help but rekindle our old ambitions on the Rhine. Our troops are already occupying the west bank of the river, with some of our advisors saying we should share pieces of Germany with the Benelux countries, to draw them into war with Germany as well, in case of a future war. On the other hand, we could just have the Rhine for ourselves. Despite that, shockingly, we receive a proposal from the Russian Foreign Relations Minister, suggesting that we take only the Palatinate, giving Northern Rhineland to our Belgium allies, significantly strengthening them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800855;\n\nAfter a long period of integration, today we finally welcome a another state in our union! $COUNTRY$ has the privilege of growing while unifying the opressed peoples of Eastern Europe, with representatives coming to our capital to become part of our government and ratify their last treaty before they are properly integrated into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800832;\n\nWith our hegemony over the new German Confederation and our oversight over the Rhineland and Hesse, some of our advisors are suggesting that we make some minor adjustments to the our border with these two states, guaranteeing a border with Frankfurt itself and keep control over the Bavarian Palatinate. Seeing as the Rhineland's ownership of the Palatinate was always meant to be temporary and the dukes of Hesse have properly been compensated with lands in Westphalia, redrawing the border would be met with little to no resistance from them. \n\nThis would be done by annexing these regions into the South German Confederation, which we hold a tighter grip on—being ruled directly from Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800833;\n\nWith the recent release of the non-German lands of the Austrian Empire, we can't deny that some matters were left unresolved. Today, it came to our attention that, despite now being united, Dalmatia and Croatia were never formally united after the release of the Kingdom of Croatia. Croatia was originally under Hungary and the Crown of Saint Stephen, separated from Dalmatia, with it being its own kingdom conquered by Austria during the Napoleonic Wars. \n\nNow we are left to decided the status of Croatia. Are we legitimizing the union with Dalmatia? Or maybe we could even reunite Croatia with Hungary, now that the Revolutions of 1848 are behind us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800834;\n\nNow that the matter of Croatia is resolved, there is still a loose end that we need to deal with, the fate of Sankt Veit, a city in the Adriatic Coast which was originally part of Croatia, but that we retained control, to guarantee our presence in the Adriatic. But now that we consolidated our rule over Germany we have to decided if we are to officially annex Sankt Veit into Germany or if we will return it to the Kingdom of Croatia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800835;\n\nWhen we were liberated from the Russians, we thought that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would just become our new overlords. But to our surprise, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared support our claims in White Ruthenia, restoring the borders drawn by Napoleon in 1812! \n\nWhile obvious that this is just $FROMCOUNTRY$ seeking to expand their influence through us, it is still promising to see them supporting us instead of establishing a Ruthenian state or even integrating us in a Baltic union...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800836;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have refused our offer, leaving our issues around the spheres of influence in the East Indies unresolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800837;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered us a deal in which they would give us their colony in the Gold Coast and, in return, we would recognize their control over the island of Borneo, in the East Indies. While we know that their colony in the Gold Coast became unprofitable, we have no doubt that it would be different under our rule, as it would be integrated into our colony in the region. But, about Borneo, while we don't have such a significant presence in the regiom it still leaves a sourt taste in our mouths to hand it over to the Dutch, since that would mean stripping James Brooke, the White Rajah of Sarawak, of his rightful lands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800838;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have accepted our offer! Taking the costly colony in the Gold Coast from us, in return from total hegemony over the island of Borneo! We shall be quick consolidate our rule over the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211607;\n\nToday, we received a messa from $FROMCOUNTRY$ stating that they are interested in buying Heligoland. The island fell into our ownership during the Napoleonic Wars, and now, many years after our initial occupation, the place has become little more than a vacation spot and a refuge for liberal thinkers from the continent, having little strategic value to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211608;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have agreed to sell Heligoland to us! We already shipped them their payment and sent a small garrison to guarantee control over the island. It won't take long to fully incorporate the island into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211609;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused to sell Heligoland to us! It seems they are far too attached to this glorified rock-turned-vacation spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
buy_heligoland_title;The Heligoland Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
buy_heligoland_desc;The island of Heligoland is a small island off the coast of Germany, traditionally considered part of Schleswig or the Frisian Islands. With our control over the Frisian Islands, we maybe could try to buy Heligoland from the British. The island is small and over the years—instead of becoming a naval base—it evolved into a vacation spot and safe haven for German liberals, so they wouldn't mind handing them over to us—for a small price, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800839;\n\nAfter a decisive victory against the British, the Dutch have returned to South Africa, setting up shop in Cape, as they did before the Napoleonic Wars. While the Dutch are technically our kin, the tyranny of the VOC caused our ancestors to be alienated into fleeing from their rule. But now, with the end of the VOC and their victory against the British, it may be a good idea to reunite with them, guaranteeing our safety and acess to their markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800840;\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has invited us to unite them in preparation to joining the Dutch once again. While we are a bit held back by the proposal, seeing that our ancestors had to flee from VOC rule, this was a long time ago and the VOC is long dead, so it may be worth a shot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800841;\n\nEver since our reconquest of the Cape, our eyes have turned towards the Boer states around the Drakensberg Range. The Boer were once dutchmen employed by the VOC, but released of their contracts to settle the Cape. Along the years, the rule of the VOC proved to be pretty unpopular, causing them to leave the Cape and migrate away from big cities in droves. But now, as we were deciding what to do with the Boer states, a Voltrekeer delegation has visited our administration in Kaap and petitioned the annexation of the South African Republic and its incorporation into our great nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGFREDESC;\n\nAfter centuries being ruled from London, we are once again free from the English yoke! But now that we are finally free to pursue our own path, we can't deny that the English left a significant vacuum in the governance of our nation. \n\nThat is why, if we are to enter the world stage and become a proper nation once again, we need to answer an important question: what is the source of legitimate power in our new nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502001;\n\nAs the dust finally settles and our new government gets into place, there is one last question that we must tackle, the so called "German Question". While we are greatful for both external and internal German support for our independence, now that we are free, we can't deny that the German minority could pose a treat to our state in the future. While they transfered the governance of the Baltic nation has passed on to the Baltic people, the Baltic Germans still enjoy quite a lot of privileges and we fear that, with the rise of nationalism in Europe, they will strive to join Germany, which would—with no doubt—undermine the Baltic natives if they were to succeed. It may be prudent to start to crackdown on their power before they can start conspiring against out nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800843;\n\nOur diplomat in Riga informs us that, amidst the current economic crisis happening in our Baltic allies, the German elite in Riga came to us with a offer, to have us bail Riga out of this economic disaster and, in turn, having it be incorporated into our nation. \n\nWhile it looks like a pretty good deal, it is obvious that it would alienate our Baltic allies beyond repair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800844;\n\nWhile we still recover from our current economic situation, we are met with a small $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ fleet trying to dock into Riga. While we usually could tolerate an unexpected visit from the Germans, this time it is different, the Germans have informed us that they just bought Riga after brief negotiations with the local German government and the city is now theirs. We can't deny that such a betrayal is devastating, especially in our current situation, but know we are left with two options: accepting letting the Germans take over the city or leave it clear that Riga is not for sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800845;\n\nWhile we still recover from our current economic situation, we got the news that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has offered to send us a considerable ammount of money to help us get back on our feet. Obviously, some of that help is to be sent directly towards the Germans living in our nation, but the rest is all ours to enjoy, to pay our debts or to invest into getting our economy out of this mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800846;\n\nWith our fleet trying to dock into Riga, we had a small exchange with the Baltic government, where they left clear that despite what the local government said, Riga is not for sale. While that doesn't surprise us, we still can't deny that the germans in Riga desire to be ruled by us. At this point, we could either cut our losses or strike down our old allies and not let them rule themselves anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800847;\n\nWith the recent economic ruin we are facing, our government is struggling to get our economy in order. With our people suffering, some of our advisors have started talks with our German allies, and it seems that the German diplomats have thrown around the idea of asking our allies for a bail. While this could literally save our economy, it wouldn't be for free, the German diplomats have insinuated that such a bail would come with our liberty as its price...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800848;\n\nObserving the current economic downturn in the Baltic Duchy, our diplomats in Riga saw an opportunity to increase our influence in our ally, managing to convince the Baltic government to offer us a deal: we bail them off of their current debts and, in return, they will let us have oversight over their government—turining them into our puppets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800849;\n\nOur allies have accepted to bail us out. With our coffers swelling with the German relief, we can't help but wonder if that is worth all of that was worth giving our liberty away. We can just hope now that the non-German population in our nation doesn't get too upset about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800850;\n\nDespite our generous offer, the German government has refused to bail us out. Maybe they are not as well off as we thought, or maybe they are doing us a favor letting us handle our situation ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800851;\n\nEver since our independence, our ties with Germany have been strong. And, with the special place Germans have in our nation, it would seems that a few germans began to immigrate to our nation. While we certainly could are glad to get more people, we can't deny that too much migration could lead to some conflict with with the local Baltic population in the future in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800852;\n\nWith our ruler being also the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, our connections with the German nobility are strong. Because of that, recently, some nobles from our ruler's homeland have decided to settle in the Baltic, joining the rest of the German immigrants that are slowly settling in the Baltic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800853;\n\nWhile the Hanseatic League is long dead, we have a long history with it. Reval, Pernau and even our capital, Riga, have all been part of Hanseatic League in the past, because of that, we have been working on creating a bond with Bremen, Lubeck and Hamburg in Germany, with those being the last "Hanseatic" cities remaining. Now, after months of negotiations, we managed to strike a deal with such cities, sigining a treaty allowing the free movement of workers between these old Hanseatic cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

welcome_the_polish_desc;With our union with the Slavic people, one of the biggest slavic groups in our nation are the Polish. Naturally, ever since the partitions of Poland, we ruled over a significant Polish minority, keeping it even as Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw. Now, with the Polish becoming members of our Austro-Slavic nation, we have the change to protect the Polish from both Prussian and Russian threats, by integrating them into our nation once we manage to hold enough sway over them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800854;\n\nWith the success of our revolution against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy, we give light to a new era for our people. But now, with the rise of Socialism, it seems that a new wave of ideas has have hit our nation. While these new ideas are still a minority in our government, we can't deny that the winds of change are upon us and—with the liberal mindset that sparkled the Revolutions of 1848 becoming the new status quo—we have no doubt that the socialists are here to stay, as new faction pushing political change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because of that, the revolution was born, with the Baltic people storming the Landtag and declaring the creation of $COUNTRY$. Despite that, we can't deny that Germany still holds lots of sway over our nation, bringing some question to the legitimacy of our regime. So, to quell any doubts about the sovereignty of $COUNTRY$, we shall prove ourselves to be a truly Baltic republic, by claiming Prussia, leaving it clear once and for all that we aren't mere subservient to Berlin. \n\n§RPulling yourself out of German protection is a dangerous game for the player, especially if you are a Radical Republic!

EVTDESC73649209;\n\nAfter the last Schleswig War, the Austrian Empire promissed us that it would realize a referendum in Schleswig at a later date, to let the population decide if they truly wanted to become a part of Germany, seeing as it has a significant Danish population. Thus, when war broke out between it and Prussia, we feared that that promise may soon be null and void, as Austria would be unable to fulfill if it was defeated but, int a surprising turn of events, Austria has managed to keep their position as head of the German world and thus, maybe it is a good time to ask about that referenfum they promised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800859;\n\nAfter solidifying our position in Korea, it was only natural that our next target would be Manchuria. When we first rose to great power status, Manchuria was firmly under Russian influence. However, after a violent takeover of the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway, we succeeded in replacing them as the informal overlord of the region, establishing the South Manchuria Railway Company—Mantetsu. \n\nThe company gradually came to dominate Manchurian affairs, culminating in our invasion of the region and, with Manchuria under our control, our advisors have presented a plan to use Mantetsu to develop it into a true crown jewel of our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800860;\n\nBeing completely expelled from Manchuria, our investments in the region have been seized, leaving the Mantetsu defunct and making it cease its operations, forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800862;\n\nWith our victory against Russia and the expulsion of Slavs from the Far East, it is about time we decide on how our gains will be administered. While most of the Far East would be either directly ruled as a colony or be run by local semi-independent governments, Outer Manchuria brings us an interesting question. Some executives in the Home Islands have been pushing for Outer Manchuria to be integrated into our puppet government in Manchuria, so the Mantetsu and its subsidiaries are able to operate freely on it. \n\nWhile we aren't totally opposed to this idea, with the effort we put into annexing the territory and expelling the Russians from it, we can't say that we are eager to hand it over to our puppet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now, with our invasion of Manchuria, the Mantetsu became an essential part of our occupation of the region, not only becoming responsible for around 25% of our tax revenue, but also deeply penetrating every sphere of everyday life for Japanese settlers in Manchuria. \n\nNow, with the rise of Mangyo, most of Mantetsu investment has been absorved and repurposed into serving the developing Manchurian economy, Mantetsu's role has been devolved mainly into its railway lines, planning and research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800863;\n\nMantetsu has served us well in furthering our interests in Manchuria and being a profitable company in our nation, one of our most profitable enterprise actually. But now—with our Invasion of Manchuria—we need to evolve our economic policy in Manchuria, such as to properly build it as a nation, despite still being, in practice our colony. Thus—after some small disagreements with the Kwantung Army—Yoshisuke Aikawa, founder of the Nissan zaibatsu, has established the Manchurian Industrial Development Company, integrating a great deal of Mantetsu's investments. Now, despite still operating its railway lines and its research wing their profits have diminished quite a bit, Luckily, we can still count on it to showcase the modernization of Manchuria under our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mantetsu_research_wing;Mantetsu Research Wing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mantetsu_research_wing_desc;The Mantetsu engaged in a country-wide development project, with not only its Research Wing being a center piece of Japan's colonial program, but also devoloping the country's heavy industry and soybean agriculture, with land cultivation increasing in 70% in 20 years, not to mention the construction of schools, libraries and hospitals promoted by the Mantetsu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800864;\n\nWith the formation of the Mantetsu, a considerable investment has been put into Manchuria. The railway lines were the first to be developed, together with hotels and warehouses to service them. After that, the Mantetsu built schools, libraries and even hospitals, with a wave of development into mining and agricultre following suit, headed by the Mantetsu Research Wing.\n\nBeing considered the centerpiece of Japan's colonial policy in Manchuria, the Mantetsu Research Wing is paramount to the development of our government. \n\nWhile it is mostly focused on agricultural developments for now, we have no doubt that we can only benefit from the brightest minds in Japan putting their heads into developing Manchuria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800865;\n\nThe Chosen Government Railway, also known as Sentetsu, was established after our annexation of Korea, from Korea's old military railways nationalized at the orders of the Japanese Resident-General of Korea. \n\nAlthough the Sentetsu has grown quite a bit since its creation—integrating smaller private railways lines—the Sentetsu is nowhere near the level of the Mantetsu in Manchuria. Thus, we are giving the Mantetsu jurisdiction over the Sentetsu, in hopes that the South Manchuria Railway Company can modernize the Sentetsu's locomotives while expanding its fleet. \n\nWithout a doubt, the integration between these railways lines can only bring good to our nation, especially if it means bringing the Sentetsu to Mantetsu's standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800866;\n\nThe Asia Express was a super express passenger train operated by the Mantetsu, quickly becoming its most iconic train and the fastest one in all of Asia at the time. With American reporters praising its speed and luxurious comfort, it was a showcase of Japanese technology and the advancements made by the Mantetsu, being one of the world's first locomotives to have fully enclosed and air-condioned carriages. \n\nThe Asia Express served as the Mantetsu's greatest piece of propaganda, not only showing its developments in Manchuria, but also becoming its greatest symbol, making so the company—together with the Asia Express—would live on the public consciousness for years to come—even well after Japan is expelled from Mainland Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800867;\n\nWith the Japanese Invasion of Manchuria and the propping up of $COUNTRY$, the economy of our state becomes of primary importance to the Japanese government, with Japanese officials recognizing that a poor economy would be a breeding ground for anti-Japanese and communist elements.

Oman has been a target of Persian expansion ever since the days before the Islamic invasions, with Persia having last conquered Oman during the Asharid period, under Nader Shah in 1743, a mere century ago. \n\nIn turn, after a prolonged civil war following the overthrow of Shah, Persia's most important port—Bandar Abbas—came under the control of the Imam of Muscat. A lease treaty confirming the port's status under Omani rule from 1794 has recently been revoked by our administration and—together with the invasion of Baluchistan and the western coast of Arabia—assured that our relations with Oman shifted in our favor. \n\nNow, while Oman has built quite an empire with their holdings in Africa, we hold the upper hand against them, being capable of not only seizing their Indian ports, but outright exile the Imam of Muscat to Zanzibar, giving us not only complete control over the Persian Gulf, but also seizing his lands in the Arabian Peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With that, after we reintegrate Bandar Abbas and the Island of Hormu back into our rule after years of Omani rule, it would be only natural that, to trully secure the Persian Gulf, we invade the many emirates across the Hormuz Strait. \n\nAnnexing both sides of the Hormuz Strait would not only guarantee our control over the Persian Gulf, but also pacify the many emirs on the Arabian side of it, making sure that their in-fighting won't let western powers encroach in our backyard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But now—with our positon as a rising power in the world stage and in the Middle East—we can westle our rivals for control over Syria and the entire Levant—going as far as claiming al-Quds—which would certainly let us be respected not only by Islamic powers, but by Christian ones as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With our position as the holders of al-Quds, we earned a great deal of respect from the Christian powers and from the Muslim people—to a lesser degree. While al-Quds is also a holy city in Islam, its importance pales in comparison to the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina—both found in Hedjaz. Thus—pairing it with our position as a great power—if we were to hold both al-Quds and the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina we would become the uncontested leaders of the Muslim world, even if we are part of the Shiite minority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These included ports, islands and coastal regions of Baluchistan, Strait of Hormuz and Laristan on the Persian side of the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. These annexations were afforded to Oman during the chaos that ruled Persia in her transitional period between the Zand and the Qajar dynasties, which was followed immediately by the continuous military campaign by Persia defending herself against the imperial Russian and British forces in the north and the east.\n\nDespite losing against the Sultanate of Muscat-Oman in 1846, now that that Muscat lost control over Bandar Abbas, we can once again integrate these ports back into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800874;\n\nThe recent integration of Lithuania into our nation has been quite disruptive. Not only did Lithuanians become our second biggest ethnic group, but they also increased the number of Catholics in our country, turning them into a sizeable minority. Naturally, we already took measures to accomodate the Lithuanians in our nation, but today an interesting proposal came from the Lithuanian leadership. They request that we grant them a position at the helm of $COUNTRY$, to lead the nation and use their connections in Poland and Ruthenia to find allies and help integrate the Belarussian population. Needless to say, the proposal hasn't been received very well, with some arguing that the Lithuanians want to hijack $COUNTRY$. While these fears are valid, we don't doubt that the Lithuanians have the tools to let us expand further in Russia. It also comes to our attention that giving them power would certainly placate the Catholic minority, even if the rest of the country won't be so happy about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800875;\n\nWith the Lithuanians taking over the leadership of $COUNTRY$, we naturally have been using Lithuanian claims to expand the duchy, having recently consolidated our rule over Belarus and integrated the slavs into our nation, but that is not enough. \n\nToday, some of the Lithuanian leaders have met in Vilnius, far away from the capital in Riga. There were talks that maybe the identity of $COUNTRY$ is holding the country back and that we should officially restore Lithuania as a sovereign and independent nation, moving the capital to Vilnius to announce the change in course. \n\nNo consensus was reached at first, but we will have to decide: do we keep true to the nation that our brother's have granted to us, or do we seize the chance to revive Lithuania?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our expansion into Ruthenia began ever before Chirstianization, with the rich cities of Ruthenia granting the resources to fight the repeated agressions of the Teutonic and Livonian Orders. In return, Ruthenian magnates held on to their lands and kept a lot of autonomy under Lithuanian rule, with some Lithuanian nobles even converting to Orthodox Christianity and many of the Grand Duchy's official documents. \n\nOur state has already integrated the White Ruthenians into our nation, but now, with the acquisition of Kiev in the heart of the Rus, we are in a position to tackle the integration of the Ruthenians further south, granting them the same right as the Ruthenians to the north, with a bit of extra autonomy on top of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That is not to say our relation with our Jewish communities was perfect as Lietvaks suffered both from expulsions and conflicts with the nobility. \n\nDespite that, many Jewish communities prospered under our rule, with our capital, Vilnius, being often known by the moniker "Jerusalem of the North", with Lietvaks such as Vilna Gaon and Mendele Mocher Sforim being important figures in the Jewish world.

EVTDESC800877;\n\nIt would seem that some turmoil is brewing within the Swiss Confederation, with Catholic cantons banding together in what they call "The Sonderbund". As a proeminent Catholic power and neighbor of Switzerland, it is in our interest to protect the Swiss Catholics from their protestant "opressors", with the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 allowing great powers to intervene in Switzerland if they all deemed necessary. The problem is Britain has vetoed any action in Switzerland, wishing to see the new constitution which the Catholics oppose pass, meaning that, by intervening in Switzerland, we would be breaking the Treaty of Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fater the Union of Krewo, many more treaties would deepen the ties between Poland and Lithuania, until the Union of Lublin, which replaced the personal union between both states with a real union, creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. \n\nDespite the Union being agreed on by the Lithuanian representatives, the truth is that it was more of a diktat, with Poland seizing the rich lands of Ruthenia after facing resistance from the Polish representatives, forcing them back into the negotiation table, finally accepting the Union of Lublin under the Polish terms. \n\nIf we were to denounce the Union, we would be able to claim the seized Ruthenian territories once again, at the cost of straining our relationship with the Poles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But, after the Treaty of Vilnius and the Livonian Wars in 1561 Livonia was divided between the Duchies of Livonia and Courland, with Livonia becoming a vassal of the Grand Duke of Lithuania. \n\nNow, with the restoration of our great nation, it is only natural that we renew this old arrangement, claiming Lithuania as an integral part of our nation, together with the Duchy of Courand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now it is time to organize the region to better fit our needs. \n\nObviously, there are many disagreements about how to tackle the region, if we should break its tribal structures for ease of governance, if we should set up a commission to study the region ethnic lines and help stabilize the region, or even if we should just let the Governor-General of the Steppes deal with the local tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On top of that, with the Qasimi fleet being destroyed and our advances into their Arabian holdings, the Qasimi find themselves in a severely weakened state, which we can't allow the Persians to exploit but would be happy to exploit it ourselves.

Both have been pretty good trade partners to us ever since we established a presence in southern Iran. While it would require a bit of persuasion, but we could try to sway these tribes to join us. The Laris would certainly take quite a bit of "convincing" to joing our cause, but–in contrast—the Baluchis would probably be a bit more open to our overlordship, as long as we keep them safe from the Qajars. \n\nWith both these groups under our thumb, we would be able to not only connect Gwadar and Bandar-e Abbas by land, but also deprive the Qajars from their control over Laristan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800892;\n\nJosé Gervasio Artigas was the soldier and statesman known as Protector of the Free Peoples and the Father of the Federalist Party. Regarded as a national hero by Federalists and Uruguayans, Artigas fought in the Argentine War of Independence, fighting to liberate Banda Oriental (modern-day Uruguay) from Spanish rule, until being betrayed and then hunted by the Unitarians in Buenos Aires, leading to the creation of the Liga de los Pueblos Libres, of which he was declared Protector. Waging a war against both Buenos Aires and the Brazilians forces which conquered Uruguay, his allies achieved a victory against the Unitarians, but his defeats at the hands of the Brazilians and their compromises with Buenos Aires strained the relationship between Artigas and the other leaders of the Federal Movement, which lead to his exile in Paraguay. Now that we control Paraguay, we are informed that Artigas is still alive somewhere in Asunción, with the question being if we should try to contact him or not. Maybe after all that he has done, the old man deserves some rest, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800893;\n\nA small detour to the stabilization of Argentinian Paraguay was the order to find Artigas wherever he may be, with soldiers asking around about the location of Artigas disrupting the local population slightly. Luckily, not long ago, the new governor has informed Rosas that Artigas was kept under house arrest in a farm in Asunción ever since the start of the war and, on top of that, after establishing contact with Artigas the old man refused to let anyone in or leave his farm. He would only let someone in when Rosas personally went to visit him, with both men riding across Ybyray Farm as they had an uneasy conversation about the current state of Argentina and the Federal Party. It is stated that Artigas was critic of Rosas' government, telling him to "not cozy up to the Porteño elites" and criticizing the lack a constitution. Despite that, the old man seemed quite hopeful seeing La Plata becoming a little more united, even asking Rosas if he thinks his homeland will one day rejoin the rest of Argentina, which Rosas replied...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800894;\n\nA small detour to the stabilization of Argentinian Paraguay was the order to find Artigas wherever he may be, with soldiers asking around about the location of Artigas disrupting the local population slightly. Luckily, not long ago, the new governor has informed Urquiza that Artigas was kept under house arrest in a farm in Asunción ever since the start of the war and, on top of that, after establishing contact with Artigas, the old man invited Urquiza to spend a day in Ybyray with him. Soon, Urquiza would make a small trip to Paraguay, with both him and Artigas riding across Ybyray Farm as they had a conversation about the current state of Argentina and the Federal Party. It is stated told that the Artigas found some respite in seeing Rosas deposed, glad that the government is taking steps to curtail the Porteño elite and enact a constitution, with the old man looking quite hopeful with La Plata becoming a little more united, even asking the Urquiza if he thinks his homeland will one day rejoin the rest of Argentina, which Urquiza replied...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800895;\n\nAfter a while of asking around for Artigas' whereabouts we finally got news from the new governor of Paraguay informing that Artigas departed from Paraguay intent on returning to Montevideo, now that it is once again united with Argentina. We tried to contact Artigas to arrange a meeting in Buenos Aires, but the old man refused to step foot in the city, instead insisting that the Rosas met him on the crossing of the Uruguay River, which Rosas did today. The meeting between the two men was somewhat tense, but amicable, with Artigas congratulating Rosas' rule despite some criticism. At the end of the meeting Rosas granted Artigas once more the title of "Gobernador de la Província Oriental del Uruguay", much to his delight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800896;\n\nAfter a while of asking around for Artigas' whereabouts we finally got news from the new governor of Paraguay informing that Artigas departed from Paraguay intent on returning to Montevideo, now that it is once again united with Argentina. Before we could try to arrange a meeting, Artigas showed up in Paraná, our provisional capital, followed by an small entourage of followers. Urquiza was quick to meet Artigas before he departed the city, with the two men spending the afternoon together. The meeting between the two men was pretty amicable, with Artigas congratulating Urquiza's rule and success against Rosas. At the end of the meeting Urquiza granted Artigas once more the title of "Gobernador de la Província Oriental del Uruguay", much to his delight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800897;\n\nDespite the lack of love between Artigas and the current Unitarian government, we still tried to contact Artigas but, despite finding him at his home in Ybyray Farm, he refused to let our soldiers in, stating that he didn't wish to talk with any Unitarian lackey. Hearing of these news, our president seized the opportuny to—during a visit to Asunción—try to visit Artigas, but the old man still refused to talk to any member of our current government, with the president standing awkwardly in front of Ybyray Farm before finally leaving to go on with his schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800898;\n\nAfter a while of asking around for Artigas' whereabouts we finally got news from the new governor of Paraguay informing that Artigas departed from Paraguay intent on returning to Montevideo, wishing on spending his last days in Montevideo where he was born. With Artigas nearing the end of his life, we couldn't bear to disturb him, letting the old man quietly return to his hometown and live his last days in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600080;\n\nWith the enactment of our constitution, our senators and representatives have elected our first president, José Fructuoso Rivera y Toscana. In contrast to other important figures such as Juan Antonio Lavalleja, Riveira remained in Uruguay during the period of Brazilian annexation, only joining the 33 Orientals once the party crossed into Uruguay. Despite fighting alongside Lavalleja at first, the two clearly had a falling off, worrying some observers about possible conflicts between Riveira and Lavalleja.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600081;\n\nDespite the assassination attempt on his life and Lavalleja's betrayal, Riveira managed to reach the end of his term in one piece, even if he fought some turmoil on the way. With the next election approaching, Riveira has favored one of the 33 Orientals, Manuel Ceferino Oribe y Viana, as his successor, with both men having once fought together under José Gervasio Artigas back in the day. While Oribe should easily win the presidency, Riveira should still retain the command of the army, which should retain Riveira's influence in the government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600082;\n\nThe removal of Riveira from the command of the army was a bold move by Oribe, with the pardoning of Lavalleja only worsening relations between Riveira and Oribe. The situation became so dire that Riveira started to tell his supporter to wear blue armbands (which quickily turned into red armbands) and Oribe—in return—asking for his followers to wear white armbands instead, leading to a division between the supporters of Riveira, the Colorados, and the supporters of Oribe, the Blancos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
oust_riveira_desc;While Riveira appointed Oribe as his successor, he remained in charge of the armed forces of Uruguay for a while. But, as one of the 33 Orientals, Oribe loyalty to Riveira is fragile at best, with some pointing out that both men have been rivals ever since the days of Artigas. With Oribe's ascension to power, friction between the two man began to appear, with Oribe soon deciding to take away Riveira's position at the command of the Uruguayan Army and pardon Lavalleja for his attempts against Riveira's life and government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600083;\n\nLavalleja was the runner-up to Riveira during the 1830 election. Despite harboring a lot of support, Lavalleja couldn't beat the impressive popularity of Riveira, leading to his defeat. Motivated by Riveira's frequent absences and the lack of influence in the government, Lavalleja has just taken arms against Riveira and—with the help of Eugenio Garzón—launched an open revolt to the current government. \n\nLavalleja found some initial success at first, almost capturing Riveira at one point, failing to negotiate with the government in Montevideo and eventually being defeat and exiled from Uruguay. \n\nLavalleja would return once more two times, once in april 1833 and then in march 1834, with both attempts hardly being as successful as his first insurgency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incite_corrientes_title;Support the Unitarians in Corrientes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incite_corrientes_desc;For a long time, two projects of country divided Argentina. Unitarianists or Unitarians were the proponents of the concept of a Unitary state (centralized government) in Buenos Aires and they were led by  Juan Lavalle. They were opposed to the Argentine Federalists, who wanted a federation of independent provinces, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Unitarians, sympathetic to our government, fled Argentina in exile after being defeated in 1831. Rosas, the so called Restorer of the Laws, controlled the Argentine Confederation for too long under his despotic rule. Now, our friends in Uruguay defeated the Blancos and promise to support us if we were to fight the Federalists to end Rosas despotic ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600084;\n\nWe can't say that Corrientes was always the most loyal province. Despite being one of the founding members of the Federal League and part of the League of the Free Peoples under Artigas, Corrientes had a hard time joining the Federal League in the first place and, through the 1840's, Corrientes would fall under Unitarian control 4 times, with it even rising up a 5th time in support of Urquiza in Entre Rios, with this revolt being successful in removing Rosas. \n\nBut now, be it under the command of Astrada, Ferré, Lavalle or even Madariaga, we need to crush the Unitarian revolt of Corrientes, before they solifidy their position in Mesopotamia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_varela_title;Send Varela to Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_varela_desc;§RVarela will be assassinated in march 1848, so be sure to take this decision before that!§! The Unitarians during the Big War counted not only with the support of Uruguay but also limited Anglo-French support. While both nations couldn't wage direct war with Rosas without allies to the ground, we could send Florencio Varela to negotiate with France and Britain for support, with the permission to take desperate measures if needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600085;\n\nWhile they aren't directly involved on land, the British and the French are big supporters of Riveira in their interests of getting allies in the region against Rosas. Thus, in our current struggle against the Federalists currently in Buenos Aires, we sent Francisco Varela to England and France to gather support from these two European powers to aid in our struggle against Rosas. While our first offer would be to grant them free navigation through the Uruguay and Paraná rivers, we wouldn't be opposed to offer them a protectorate over Mesopotamia, if the situation is dire enough for that. \n\nSo, what is Varela willing to offer to London and Paris?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600086;\n\nOur involvement in the war between Rosas and Riveira has been limited at best, with the Anglo-French Blockade over Argentina starting over the Siege of Montevideo, but the situation has taken quite an interesting turn. While we were busy preventing Oribe from storming Montevideo, Riveira has went ahead and promoted an Uniratian revolt in Corrientes. The Uniratians were exiles from Argentina after their defeat in 1831, but now they come to us with an offer: in exchange from our full support in the war of independence against Rosas, they will grant us a protectorate over their new "Republic of Mesopotamia". While this may damage our relations in the region, it would fulfill our goals of opening up navigation on the Paraná and Uruguay rivers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600087;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have reportedly accepted our offer and declared war on Rosas and the Argentine Confederation. Now it is only a matter of time before Mesopotamia is recognized as Unitarian territory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600088;\n\nThe $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have reportedly rejected our offer, with Varela's offer leading them to declare that the Unitarians ambitions in Mesopotamia went against their interests in the region, withdrawing all support towards us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600089;\n\nAfter a brief campaign in Argentina, it seems that Rosas and his army managed to repel all of our attempts to invade Argentina, leading to our defeat. After a prolonged period of outright war between our nations we sign peace with the Argentine dictator, hoping to recover from this humiliation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600090;\n\nOnce again we managed to win—against all odds—a war against an European war. Despite their attempts to establish a protectorate over Mesopotamia the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have been defeated and their blockade over Argentina has been lifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600091;\n\nDespite Rosas best efforts, it seems that, unlike Spain, the British and France forces couldn't be as easily beaten. The Unitarians have managed to establish a nation in Mesopotamia and, with the protection of an European power, we would hardly be ever able to reintegrate them into Argentina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600092;\n\nIt seems that we managed to deal a significant blow the the Federalist government in Buenos Aires, leading Rosas to sue for peace and accept our protectorate over Mesopotamia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600093;\n\nThe Unitarians have swayed the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ into declaring war against us, stating their intentions to not only free up navigation in the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, but also establish a protectorate in Mesopotamia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600094;\n\nOribe's war against Riveira didn't went well. Despite some initial victories and even being able to expel Riveira to Brazil, Riveira found allies in the tumultuous Rio-grandense Republic, which helped him return to Uruguay and inflict several blows to Oribe's government, imposing on him defeat after defeat. But the last blow wasn't dealt by Riveira, instead, during their blockade of Buenos Aires, the French have occupied Martín García Island, leading Oribe to "resign" and flee to Buenos Aires, surrendering the country to Riveira.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600095;\n\nFollowing their occupation of Entre Rios, the currently occupying Corrientes approached us with a proposal: in exchance for end of hostilities between us, they wish to have the independence of the Republic of Mesopotamia to be recognized. We can't say that that such an arrangement is to our liking, seeing as Mesopotamia is one of the most Federalist regions in the country, severely hurting our political position, but we have been unable to destroy Corrientes' armies, forcing us to accept their deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600096;\n\nAfter a prolonged conflict with Rosas, we ended up in an uneasy stalemate. Our repeated revolts managed to exhaust Rosas' army and, on top of that, with the revolts in the Interior in the interior, we have enough leverage to propose a deal: Rosas could keep the Confederation, but Corrientes would keep Mesopotamia, breaking off from the confederation and allowing it to open the Paraná and Uruguay rivers as a compensation to its allies, forming the Republic of Mesopotamia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600097;\n\nWhile the idea of a "Republic" in Mesopotamia isn't new, this is the first time we achieve true independence in the region, with the last "Republic of Entre Rios" being mostly a statement against the Unitarian government that sat in Buenos Aires at the time. But now the roles are flipped, with Mesopotamia being occupied by an Unitarian government and Buenos Aires by and Federalist one. Now, with our independence accepted by Buenos Aires, there is a small debate about what to call our nation: "Republic of Mesopotamia" or "Independent State of Litoral"?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800899;\n\nWith the defeat of the 4th and final Unitarian Army in Corrientes and the other Unitarian revolts, the province is once again loyal to the Argentine Confederation and the Federalist cause. After changing governors many times during the conflict, now rises to power the General Benjamín Virasoro as the governor of the province. Having served under Governor Urquiza in his final campaign to retake Corrientes and being a staunch Federalist, we believe he has the experience and the loyalty to keep the province under Federal control for good this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600098;\n\nDespite being able to defeat the 1st Unitarian Army of Corrientes by himself, the governor Pascual Echagüe suffered defeat at the hands of the 3rd Unitarian Army of Corrientes, leading to his removal as government and the appointment of Justo José de Urquiza as Governor of Entre Rios. Despite some initial setbacks at the hands of the 3rd Army of Corrientes and even condemned by Rosas, Urquiza would ultimately be successful in defeating the Unitarists for good at the Battle of Vences. Luckily, Entre Rios—with the blockade of Argentina's only port—managed to get quite wealthy, but now, with the blockade lifted, the trade dominance of Buenos Aires is once again bothering the provinces of the Litoral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
urquiza_proclamation_desc;On May 1st, 1851, General and Governor Justo José de Urquiza, unsatisfied with the lack of the return of the trade-primacy of Buenos Aires after the end of the Anglo-French Blockade and Rosas lack of a proper constitution for the Argentine Confederation decreed the Urquiza's Statement, on which he formally accepted Rosas resignation—which he applied for every year, knowing his resignation as foreign relations minister would be rejected—declaring the effective independence of the Province of Entre Rios until a proper General Assembly for the writing of a constitution was called. \n\nUrquiza's Statement was supported by his political pupil Benjamín Virasoro—Governor of Corrientes—which until now was considered one of Rosas' partisans. Rosas, in the other hand, naturally rejected the statement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600100;\n\nWith the "Ejército Grande" taking shape, it began to organize itself in Diamante, with the intention of crossing into the Province of Santa Fé, where governor Pascual Echagüe (who became Governor of Santa Fé after losing his position as Governor of Entre Rios) prepared a defense against Urquiza and his army. \n\nOn a surprising turn of events, not only did Urquiza's Staff counted with naturals of Santa Fé who kept him updated on the situation across the Paraná River, but the cities of Santa Fé and Rosário both proclaimed support to Urquiza, forcing Echagüe to leave the province to regroup in Buenos Aires, leading Urquiza to take Santa Fé without bloodshed and the start of the war against Rosas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600101;\n\nWe have been ready for war ever since Urquiza released his statement, declaring effective independence from the Argentine Confederation. Due to the marshy terrain of Southern Entre Rios, we were sure that General Urquiza would attemp a crossing to Santa Fé first, which General Pascual Echagüe was in charge of. Echagüe left the city of Santa Fé itself to prepare to meet Urquiza after his crossing, but both the cities of Santa Fé and Rosário stabbed our government in the back, declaring their allegiance to Urquiza. Echagüe was forced to leave the province, with his men deserting him as he made his way to Buenos Aires, with only 300 men remaining by the time he got to Rosas. It is clear our change to put down this revolt is now or never, lest we risk more desertions from our men and other provinces...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46610020;\n\nHaving clashed with the Argentines all throughout the Uruguayan Civil War, we are now informed that General José Justo de Urquiza, Governor of the Entre Rios Province in the Argentine Confederation has declared war on Rosas, with the intention of deposing Rosas from the ruling of the Confederation. While Urquiza has once been our enemy, we can't deny that supporting him would benefit us, considering that we could arrange some concessions to disrupt Argentine hegemony over the Paraná and Uruguay rivers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600104;\n\nWhile our government stabilizes after our victory at the Battle of Caseros, we recieve news that back in Corrientes, a revolt has granted Gregorio Pujol control over the province. While we are a bit unsure about Pujol's loyalty to Urquiza's cause, he ultimately wouldn't bring Corrientes against the Argentine Confederation, not to mention that Benjamín Virasoro—the old Governor of Corrientes and right-hand man of Urquiza—doesn't seem to mind, considering his new role in the Confederation besides Urquiza.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600103;\n\nDespite some initial setbacks, Rosas managed to beat the traitor José Justo de Urquiza and his army of Unitarian savages and foreign enemies. The Ejército Grande was shattered, with Brazil and Uruguay suing for peace, leaving Urquiza and his allies under our mercy. New governors are already being appointed to the provinces, with Rosas hoping that the Argentine Confederation can finally find some degree of peace now. While this incident has been dealt with, we can't deny that it brought into question some matters regarding the Federal Pact and national organizaiton, which Rosas will need to adress if he wants to solidify his legacy as the Father of the Argentine Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600102;\n\nWith their momentum from the bloodless takeover of Santa Fé, Urquiza, together with his Uruguayan and Brazilian allies, managed to win the decisive Battle of Caseros, leading Rosas to resign and flee the country, effectively exiling him to England. With this great victory, Urquiza is left as the definitive master of the Argentine Confederation. Luckily, the general is already preparing the ground for a new constitutional convention, promoting the San Nicolás Agreement, setting the bases for the national organization of the future Argentine Constitution. Sadly, Buenos Aires refused to ratify the pact, leading to Urquiza to intervene in the province, putting down any dissent for the time being...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600105;\n\nIt would seem that Urquiza's Federal Intervention on Buenos Aires wasn't enough to quell the Unitarian sentiment in the city. Urquiza left the city in the 8th of September to preside over the Constitutient Congress' sessions, and 3 days later, in the 11 September, a bloodless coup by took over Buenos Aires, with the new government in the city preparing to act against Urquiza!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600106;\n\nDepiste our victories in the Litoral, the interior provinces of the Argentine Confederation seem to be having their fair share of trouble. Sensing the Federalist infighting, many Federalist governors in the interior were deposed, with one of the more worrying examples being found in the north, being of the provinces of Tucumán, Salta and Santiago del Esterro which—after changing hands a couple of times—all ended up under the control of an Unitarian alliance in the north, led by Manuel Taboada. Despite the calls for help from the Federalist governor of Tucumán—Celedonio Gutiérrez—against Manuel Taboada and his ally José María del Campo, Urquiza wasn't of much use, leading to del Campo's takeover of Tucumán and the persecution of Federalists in Tucumán.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600107;\n\nEven with their overwhelming influence over the Santiago del Esterro and its neighboring provinces, the Northern Alliance under Manuel Taboada has finally come it is end, leading to more stability over the region. That is not to say that his Liberal Party is dead, sadly such an Unitarian tool can't hardly die as easily as Taboada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600108;\n\nThe Argentine Constitution of $YEAR$ was promulgated by Provisional Director José Justo de Urquiza. Being the 3rd Argentine Constitution of the country, it would see more success than the 1st and 2nd constitutions—which both were proposed by Buenos Aires but failed to gain support from the other provinces. The Constitution was based on the Federal model and the Federal Party's ideas, on top of being heavily inspired by the United States Constitution and the pioneering ideas of Juan Bautista Alberdi. Its text granted high level of independence to the Argentine provinces, a strong executive branch government and a bicameral national congress. \n\nLess than a year after the promulgation of the constitution, Urquiza would assume office as the 1st President of the Argentine Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600109;\n\nIt seems that the victory against Rosas was only the first step for the new Argentine Confederation. While the armies of Buenos Aires were quick to be beaten and an ex-Rosist mutiny laid siege to the city, allying with Urquiza, such a siege appears to have no end in sight. \n\nWe were already starved off of money to play our troops, but we hoped that the blockade of the city would make it fall soon enough. Sadly, such plans went down the drain once Commander John Halstead Coe accepted a bribe from the Buenos Aires' government in exchange for the surrender of the navy in favor of Buenos Aires. Now, with no prospect to ever finish the siege like that, we are forced to withdraw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600110;\n\nAfter a prolonged conflict with Rosas, we ended up in an uneasy stalemate. Urquiza's coffers were running dry and—despite having the money to fund his troops—Rosas's army was under severe disadvantage, due to Urquiza's Brazilian and Uruguayan auxiliaries. On top of that, with the lack of reinforcement's from the interior, Urquiza had enough leverage to propose a deal: Rosas could keep the Confederation, but Urquiza and his allies would break off from the Confederation, forming the Independent State of the Litoral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Between foreign and personal interests, to some degree, Entre Rios independence from the Argentine Confederation was founded on bases of the wish to uphold the ideals of Federalism. To reinforce our place as the bastion of "True Federalism", we could—to some degree—claim to be the true successor to the League of the Free Peoples, the state that—under José Gervasio Artigas—gave birth to the Federalist movement in Argentina. Doing so would put us at odds with our old allies, which now occupy territory which was once part of the League and would also rekindle our hostilities with Buenos Aires, which not only may still claim to be successors to the League, but also hold the Province of Córdoba, which was also part of the League to some degree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With both failed attempts on the conquest of Paraguay by Platine forces, the country's independence was secured. But now—as we carry the mantle of the League of the Free Peoples—Paraguay stands as the only country—besides us—between Argentina and Brazil. Thus, conquering it would not only avenge Artigas' attempt, but also become a stronger buffer between the two giants that border us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the recent years, as the Argentine Confederation evolves, the old caudillos that were the heads of the Federalist Party are less and less able to gather power and influence, effectively changing the party's dynamics in the last few years. With the declining power of the caudillos, the party started to enjoy new factions, threatening to break away the party, the most relevant of which being the National Autonomists, the head of which is Nicolás Avellaneda, who is not only aligned with important figures like Alberdi, but is also a proponent of the institutional modernization of the Confederation. Should Avellaneda take over the Federalist party, he is sure to let Federalism evolve to something better suited for the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800901;\n\nDespite his involvement in the 1830 Sedition, by the 1840's, as the liberal revolutions ravaged Europe, Samuel Gottfried Kerst was back in Germany to witness the liberal revolutions that swept across his fatherland. There he would become an active player in Prussian politics, working for its administration until it coming at odds with Prussia naval strategy. After falling out with the Prussian Navy, Kerst would become member of the Prussian Parliament and then a newspaper editor. \n\nMore recently, Kerst has published a series of works about German immigration to Brazil and the Rio Grandense Republic, promoting waves of German immigration, to Brazil's detriment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

oribe_repaying_the_favor_desc;When Rivera—with help from his Anglo-French backers—deposed Oribe, Rosas was the man which not only hosted Oribe in exile, but also went to war to restore Oribe to the Uruguayan presidency. Now, as Oribe sits at the head of the Uruguayan politics once again, Rosas is facing problems back home, with the governor of Entre Rios—José Justo de Urquiza—revolting against him. It is about time we return the favor and help Rosas against this insurgency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600116;\n\nWith our triumph against the traitorous Urquiza, we can't overlook the help Manuel Oribe provided us by being quick to declare war against Urquiza. Rosas can't help but consider if a closer relationship with Oribe's Uruguay would be in order, an idea that was tossed around before, but post-ponned by Urquiza's revolt. With Anglo-French influence expelled from Uruguay, no one could oppose us if we were to sign a treaty declaring Oribe to the governor of the Provincia Oriental.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600117;\n\nWith our triumph against the traitorous Urquiza, Rosas couldn't help but see the value Oribe had been to his Confederation. Naturally, seeking to deepen their partnership, Rosas proposed to Oribe that Uruguay join the Argentine Confederation, with him as its provicial governor, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800902;\n\nMany of the men who fought under Urquiza against Rosas wanted one thing and one thing only, a democratic constitution for the Argentine Federation. While we have little hope of implementing such a constitution on the Argentine Confederation—still under Rosas—with our independence, we can at least let our people bear fruit of such ideas. With nothing in his way, Urquiza called for a constitutional congress in Santa Fé, which has just finished the final draft of the Constitution of $COUNTRY$, following our federalist and democratic ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600118;\n\nDespite our allies planning to do a naval invasion of Santa Fé from Sacramento, General Justo José de Urquiza, with the help of his Uruguayan and Brazilian auxiliaries, managed to beat Rosas at the Battle of Monte Caseros, which prompted the Argentine tyrant to flee from the battlefield to Buenos Aires, where he would disguise himself and embark on a ship out of the country, effectively exiling himself and handing over the country to Urquiza.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600119;\n\nOur relations with our southern neighbors aren't the best. Argentina has tried—and failed—to invade our nation in the past and they still claim that we are just a rebelious province of their confederation. While the current head of the confederation Juan Manuel de Rosas is set on one day reconquering Paraguay, a revolt has broken on the other side of the border, with the Province of Corrientes being currently controlled by Unitarians that oppose his government. While they already count with Uruguayan support, giving them further support would only weaken Rosas and maybe provide us with leverage to negotiate our independence with the Unitarians in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While Urquiza was defeated by our great leader Rosas, the constitutional project went ahead, with the finished 135-long constitution being published in Angelis' journal in Buenos Aires. Rosas—at first—personally wasn't very keen on Angelis and his work, but with time our great leader approached Angelis personally to publish some intellectual projects of his government, creating a bridge between the two men. \n\nWith Rosismo evolving and Rosas' health starting to fade, it may be for the best that—instead of relying on Rosas' son to carry his regime on—we commission Angelis' constitution to be sanctioned as the official constitution of the Argentine Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600120;\n\nPrincess Alice arrival in Buenos Aires was a celebrated one. It was hard to convince the English government to let Alice be crowned Queen of Argentina, but—after guaranteeing Alice would reign as a constitutional monarch—the British Royal Family accepted letting Alice be our queen. \n\nJust like that, today, on the year of our Lord $YEAR$, Alice Maud Mary, also known as Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, was crowned as Queen Alice I, of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotta dynasty, first queen of the Argentine Monarchy. Long live the Queen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600121;\n\nSadly, for one reason or another, the British Royal Family refused to let Princess Alice be crowned Alice I of Argentina. While this is quite a setback to Rosas monarchical plans, maybe, if he is so set on following this path, the dictator could declare himself Protector of Argentina and Restorer of the Order, granting him the title of king Juan Manuel de Rosas I, the first of the Rosas dynasty, first king of the Argentine Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While vague, Angelis confessed—at a later date—to including it as a path to reintegrate Paraguay into the Confederation. Paraguay has long been a great reason of shame and a thorn in our side, with its dictator—Carlos Antonio López—having supported both the Unitarians in Corrientes and the traitors under Urquiza. But—following Angelis draft—we have established negotiations with Asunción which have yet to be fruitful. Maybe it is about time we cut off our relations with Paraguay and end their independence once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600124;\n\nThe French Blockade, while not enough to make us kneel under its weight, surely hit our nation quite hard, so much so that the landowners of Buenos Aires started to conspire with our French and Unitarian enemies to depose our great leader from Buenos Aires. This conspiracy was able to reach Rosas' personal friend, Manuel Vincente Maza, whose son was chosen as son of said conspiracy. As the conspirators were ready to strike, Rosas managed to arrest Maza's son, which—after supposedly trying to help his son—was assassinated in his office, with his son being executed in the next day. With that, the revolt lost the support in Buenos Aires itself, with it being limited to a small army in the south of Buenos Aires. The army was meant to be lead by Juan Galo de Lavalle, the old Unitarian governor of Buenos Aires, but he ended up being leading his army into Entre Rios, were he found some degree of success, leaving the revolt in Buenos Aires to fight on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600125;\n\nOnce, the interior was safely under the rule of Facundo Quironga. But ever since his death in 1835, things began to change. Governors of the interior provinces began to slowly be swayed to the Unitarian cause, leading to a small revolt by Domingo Cullen, which was swiftly dealt with by governor Juan Pablo López—of Santa Fé. Now, with the war against Corrientes waging on another bigger, more threatening revolt, has come to be, with the governor of Tucumán—Marco Manuel Avellaneda—rallying an coalition against Rosas, joining forces with the governors of Salta, Jujuy, Catamarca and La Roja. Rosas tried to prevent the uprising by seizing Tucumán's guns, but the general he sent—Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid—joined forces with the coalition—due to his Unitarian background.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Perhaps now it's time we finally rejoin Buenos Aires...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600126;\n\nWhen Alto Peru was incorporated in the Argentine Confederation, it was bound to have a special status. Since then, Argentine politics have slowly sapped into Bolivia, with disputes between Unitarians and Federalists also happening in Alto Peru, as they also happened in the Argentine Interior. Together with the governors of La Roja, Santa Fé and—of course—Buenos Aires, the Governor of Alto Peru was one of the pivotal federalist governors in the confederation. But recently, the old governor left the office, giving way to a new governor, less alligned with Rosas and his ideals. Now, be it for a desire to trully support the Bolivian people, to support the Unitarians or pure madness, the new governor of Alto Peru has declared, in La Paz, war on Rosas and his Federalist confederation, rallying the Bolivian people to his side. Sadly, we can't say that the entire country followed the governor's idea, with provinces like Tarija and Salta regrettably declaring loyalty to the confederation, taking arms against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The governor of Alto Peru was—among the governors of La Roja, Santa Fé and, of course, Buenos Aires—one of the most important governors in the Argentine Confederation. But after serving us truthfully, the governor of Alto Peru was deposed by one of his subordinates, which now, in our moment of weakness, has declared war on Rosas, trying to have Bolivia to rule as his little fiefdom. Luckily, some of Alto Peru sees this madness and chooses to take arms against the mad caudillo, declaring allegiance to governor Rosas and his confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Shamefully, with the death of the old governor of Alto Peru, the local governor in Alto Peru has elected a new caudillo to rule the region for the confederation. To our surprise, the new caudillo proved himself quite popular, with this hold over Alto Peru benefiting the confederation, with no doubt. But now, in our moment of weakness, it would seen that the governor of Alto Peru has declared the wish to "free the Bolivian people from the clutches of Buenos Aires", declaring war on Rosas for the independence of the Republic of Bolivia. Luckily, some of Alto Peru is still interested in being part of the Argentine Confederation, declaring allegiance to the Argentine Confederation, hindering the plans of this new "President of Bolivia"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The governor of Alto Peru was—among the governors of La Roja, Santa Fé and, of course, Buenos Aires—one of the most important governors in the Argentine Confederation. Argentinian politcs were bound to penetrate Alto Peru. The local governor had to put down not only nationalistic elements, but Unitarians as well. But it would seem that the governor of Alto Peru—as did the other governors in the interior—ended up falling for Unitarian rethoric, becoming open enemies to Rosas Federalist party and allying with the Unitarian revolts across our country. They are now just one more Unitarian revolt we have to deal with it. Luckily, some of the Alto Peruvian provinces are loyal to the federalist cause, declaring allegiance to Rosas and the Argentine Confederation, lest the Unitarians in Buenos Aires strip away their liberties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600130;\n\nThe Army of North was victorious! Our role in the downfall of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation—despite being somewhat limited—earned us the opportunity to take a few spoils from this war. While it would be in our ultimate interest to make Bolivia join our great nation—as it was once part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata—our role in the war was far too small for such a prize. But, that is not to say we are to leave empty handed, as we hold solve some contested claims with Bolivia, or even look into some of their territory which we could annex. Besides our claims in Tarija and Susquis, we also could also annex the Bolivian ports in Antofagasta, which were once part of the Province of Salta. On top of that, one of the ideas we had during the war was to sack Potosí and its mint, luckily, this idea wouldn't come to fruition, but maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to take the city and its mint for ourselves, considering it was responsible for our minting first coins. Annexing any of these territories for ourselves its bound to make mortal enemies out of the Bolivians, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600131;\n\nRivera, by igniting a revolt in Corrientes, led to a general Unitarian uprising across Argentina, with revolts Rosas' regime facing revolts in the Interior and Buenos Aires. Regrettably, one of the campaigns had to be fought over Alto Peru, where—to our surprise—we faced some support, despite the betrayal coming from the local governor. Provinces like Tarija and Salta came to our aid in our hour of need and now, as the dust settles, they ask for deeper ties with the Argentine Confederation, wanting to be a direct part of the Confederation, rather than being under Alto Peru.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Artigas was the first to do so, with his policies and networks reaching the indigenous peoples. Besides that, as the Federalist model favored local power, Federalist caudillos were quick to use the local natives to their advantage, not to mention that nods to the native population weren't an exclusive Federalist phenomenon, with the declaration of independence by the Congress of Tucumán being published in Spanish, Quechua and Aimara.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600134;\n\nHaving defeated the Argentinian Army of North, our Confederation stands victorious! Our enemies expected a weak and unstable confederation, but they were gravely mistaken and it is now time we decide the price they will pay for it. While most argue we should just make our $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ neighbors drop our claims on us, there is the real possibility of getting some extra land out of this, at the cost of making an permanent enemy to the south.

EVTDESC600135;\n\nAfter the Revolution of the Restorers, Balcarce was succeed by Juan José Viamonte, which soon was forced to resign as well, leading to Manuel Vicente Maza to assume the Governorship of Buenos Aires, after no one else accepted the position. Maza—a friend of Rosas who participated in the Revolution of the Restorers—would soon have to resign as well, as in February he sent Federalist leader Facundo Quironga to settle a dispute in the Interior. On his way there, Quirong was assassinated, leading to such public outrage that he was forced to resign, with the House of Representatives of Buenos Aires finally yelding and electing Juan Manuel de Rosas to the governorship of the province, granting him the "sum of the public power" and thus dictatorial powers. \n\nRosas would become the 17th Governor of Buenos Aires in the 13th of March.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600136;\n\nWith the help of the Sociedad Popular Restauradora—and its parapolice unit, La Mazorca—Rosas managed to use state terrorism as a tool for his regime. La Mazorca would conduct raids into neighborhoods, persecuting anyone not deemed loyal enough to Rosas, accusing them of having ties to the Unitarians. Rosas would exercise full control of La Mazorca as a tool for terror, burning opposition newspapers and being sure to pick on the target which demise would be the most useful as a tool of terror, instead of carrying out its attacks randomly. In the end, most enemies of Rosas would end up having to exile themselves—usually to Montevideo, where they would find support with the Uruguayan colorados—leaving the Argentine dictator with full control over the Province of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600137;\n\nRosas' new regime sought to control every aspect of public life, buildings were decorated in red, the color of Rosismo and Federalism, every public document held the inscription "Death to the Savage Unitarians" at the top of it, government employees were forced forced to wear a badge saying "Federation or Death" and every male and female had to sport a "federal look", with males being forced to grow moustaches and sideburns, not to mention the children also having to wear uniforms with the colors and motiffs of the new regime. The red color became omnipresent in Buenos Aires as a constant reminder of Rosas and his regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600138;\n\nThe dictorial powers granted by holding "the sum of public power" allowed Rosas to create an elaborate cult of personality around himself, letting him be portrayed as almighty protector of the people. His portraits were carried out on the street in demonstrations and then put on the church alter to be venerated. Rosas had the backing of most Catholic clergy, especially since most of them were on the state's payroll, since the Catholic Church had refused to acknowledge Argentinian independence, letting the government invest their own men into the churches and parishes of Buenos Aires, with the only clergy which opposed Rosas—the Jesuits—being expelled from the country as was most opposition to Rosas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600139;\n\nRosas came to control various aspects of everyday life for the people of Buenos Aires, forcing people to adhere to Federalism and Rosismo even in the way they wore their clothes. Not only that, but he also managed to enjoy some popularity with both Afro-Argentines and Gauchos, being admired for his willingness to mingle with these marginalized groups of Argentine society. That is not to say that Rosas was all-benevolent—much to the contrary—those who had the courage to oppose him are now dead, castrated or living across the Rio de La Plata in Montevideo. Rosas' hegemony over the politics of Buenos Aires is unmatched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In contrast, anyone opposed to his absolute authority is forced into hiding, or faces punishment in prison or even is made an example by our leader's agents.

The region is currently pending incorporation in our nation, with the Province of Santa Fé laying claim to part of it.

Regrettably, some of our generals have took the initiative to retake the city themselves. The last attempt was carried out by general José Maria Flores—which returned safely to Santa Fé, if a bit beaten—and general Jerónimo Costa, which, to our dismay, marched towards Buenos Aires with less than 200 men, leading to the Battle of Villamayor, which quickly turned into a massacre, as Costa's forces were forced to surrender and then executed by the savage Unitarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600153;\n\nWe can't deny that which ever city takes the place as the official capital of the Confederation has big shoes to fill, especially with how it will have to fight to stay more influential than Buenos Aires, while at the same time not being overbearing on the provinces. One of the options, of course, is to keep the capital in Paraná, which would save on the work of moving our administration anywhere. One popular option is to move the capital to Rosário, which is better suited to be the capital of the nation, or even moving the capital to Tucumán, to appeal to the Interior. On the other hand, some people argue that we would need a newly-built city to serve as the capital to trully eclipse Buenos Aires as our administrative center!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And last, but not lest, if we were to stay away from the coast, our final option would somewhere in the interior—the city of Unión.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600155;\n\nAfter the presidencies of Mitre, Sarmiento and Avellaneda, Júlio Argentino Roca—as the 4th President of the Argentine Republic—set the stage for the political climate in Argentina for the next few decades, giving way for the Generation of '80, the governing and intellectual elite that dominated Argentinian politics under the National Autonomist Party for well over 30 years. During the uncontested rule of the National Autonomist Party, Argentina found itself influced by the positivist ideas of Comte, with governance being carried with optimism and the idea that the country would grow in every aspect (be it economically, socially or culturally), let there be created the conditions for it grow. \n\nThe period was also market by the crackdown on provincial autonomy, leading to provicial identities fading away with time and the country becoming more centralized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600156;\n\nAfter the fall of the Confederation, Mitre has an easy time subjulgating the Interior—apart from Mendonza, most provinces fell without putting much of a fight. But that wouldn't mean that Federalism was quite dead in the Interior—far from it. The Revolution of the Colorados was the last Federalist revolt in the Interior, happening right in the middle of the Paraguayan War, with the provinces of Mendoza, San Luis, San Juan and La Rioja falling to the revolt, with it also finding some support in provinces such as Catamarca, Cordoba, Corrientes and Santa Fé. \n\nTo our luck, Urquiza—the Federalist Leader and Governor of Entre Rios—refrained from showing support to the revolt, despite the plea from the Federalist leaders, else we would risk finding ourselves returning to Federalist rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600157;\n\nWith Urquiza's silence in face of the Federalist revolt in the Interior, one of his old generals—Ricardo Ramón López Jordán—would turn against him, slowly plotting his revenge. On the 11th of April Jordán would revolt with a botched attempt to arrest Urquiza, which would result in the death of the Federalist leader. After that Jordán would assume as Governor of Entre Rios, but President Sarmiento would see this as an challenge to his authority, prompting him to send a troop of veterans to Entre Rios, expelling Jordan from the province. \n\nJordán would continue to clash with the Unitarian government until his arrest in the 16th of December 1876. He would later escape prision and exile himself in Montevideo, until returning in 1888 after being given amnesty, only to be assassinated in 1889. After the end of his revolt, Federalism would be dead, with its last remaining followers assimilating into Alsina's Autonomist Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600158;\n\nIt was a quiet morning in Buenos Aires. Once distant from the city center was Palermo, an once vicious swamp which Rosas chose to build his residence in, a propriety fitting for a gentleman, San Benito de Palermo. Rosas slept always ready and close to his horse, in case death were to come to him at night, through treacherous hands. But no ammount of paranoia couldn't save him from time and illness. Death would come to Rosas suddenly. A common cold would be too much for the 83 year old, leading to his death from pneumonia. \n\nNow, his son, Juan Bautista de Rosas, is meant to follow on his father's footsteps and guide the Argentine Confederation into the future. Will he follow on his father's footsteps? Or will he finally fold and give freedom to Argentina?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC600159;\n\nWhen a constitution was finally implemented, no one thought that Rosas would willingly give his power like that. The Restorer of Laws was always quick to steer politics into his interests, believing himself to be a benevolent dictator to his people. Something seems to really have changed. Rosas has officially stepped down for power as 1st President of the Argentine Confederation, giving way to a new politician who will be sure to be influenced by him to some degree. Regardless, this still dawns a new day for the Argentine Confederation, a day many waited for with for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600161;\n\nWith Rosas gone it seems that many of his old allies feared that Juan wouldn't be as competent or friendly as his father was and such—together with an influx of old Unitarians seeing Rosas' death as the opportunity to return to Buenos Aires—have organized a revolt against Juan in Buenos Aires, expelling the Federal government from the city and forcing us to take action against our own capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600162;\n\nWe would be lying if we didn't say the news of Rosas' death didn't bring us joy to some degree. Sadly, we now learn that his death brough upon the Confederation a revolt by the Unitarians, leading to the new Federal government having to declare war on the capital in Buenos Aires. While we can't help but feel that is the natural outcome of giving that much power to Buenos Aires, maybe we could make the most of the situation and return to the Confederation, leading it to victory against the Unitarians one last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600163;\n\nWe would be lying if we didn't say the news of Rosas' death didn't bring us joy to some degree. Better yet, we now learn that his death brough upon the Confederation a revolt by the Unitarians, leading to the new Federal government having to declare war on the capital in Buenos Aires. Maybe we could make the most of the situation and help Buenos Aires overthrow Rosas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600164;\n\nOur current situation has attracted the attention of $FROMCOUNTRY$, which after breaking off from the Confederation long ago seems to be interested in helping us against the Unitarians, as long as they can rule the Confederation afterwards, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600165;\n\nOur current situation has attracted the attention of $FROMCOUNTRY$, which after breaking off from the Confederation long ago seems to be interested in reforming the Confederation under their rule, declaring war against Buenos Aires and the rest of Argentina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600166;\n\nDespite our best intentions, it would seem the $FROMCOUNTRY$ wasn't very interested in letting us running the Confederation, even if it means getting our help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600169;\n\nBuenos Aires has finally been pacified. We have put to rest the last of Unitarian resistance to our rule and we are finally free to consolidate our rule over Argentina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600167;\n\nThe separation of the Litoral from Argentina was controversial, for sure. But it was a necessary measure against Rosas Totalitarianism. Now, with Rosas gone there is nothing in the way of reunifying our two nations, especially if the democratic advancements from the Litoral are implemented in the rest of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600168;\n\nWith the Federal triumph over all of Argentina's enemies, it is about time we consolidate our rule. After everything that happened, some administrative reforms are needed to let our country be better suited to run under its current leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
