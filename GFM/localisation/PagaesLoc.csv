accept_belarussians_desc;While far from our height many centuries ago, our recent conquest of White Ruthenia puts our nation in a peculiar position. Even if there were always Slavs in our nation after our independence, now, with the inclusion of our old territories, the White Ruthenians became a sizeable portion of our population, with our people becoming a minority in our own nation. Now, our ministers suggest that the best course of action would be to, instead of letting our peoples fight against each other within our own borders, we should integrate the people of White Ruthenia in our nation, granting them equal rights to Lithuanians and finding unity in our shared history under foreign rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502013;At first, after achieving our independence from the Russians, the Baltic State knew peace for the first time in centuries. But as the anniversary of our independence came near, protests started to appear, with voices asking for more representation and for the army to step down, calling our government "The Landtag of Steel". At first, the unrest was easy to deal with, but as people went to the streets again and again, with even bigger numbers each time. By this rate, the situation will get out of control unless we do something about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502014;Being the most recent addition to the Baltic State, Lithuana had already a pretty sizeable independence movement mobilized. With unrest getting more and more out of control, a bunch of proeminent Lithuanian figures declared independence from us and most of our lithunian troops already defected to this new state. Is this the start of the end to the Baltic State?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502015;After a tense week os silence with almost no news from Estonia, we recieved news that Estonia has been taken by complete chaos, with local regiments mutinying against of rule and joining the calls for representation and independence. It seems that we have completely lost control over Estonia, with drafts of an independence declaration already being writen in Reval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502016;At last, after being able to hold Latvia for so long, we lost control over most of it. The masses have taken control over most major cities, with Latvian brigades in open mutiny and some of our German troops finding themselves encircled. We barely managed to hold onto Riga, with most of the acess to the city being closed, as we hear about Latvia declaring formal independence in Mitau. Is this how the Baltic State ends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502017;Our diplomats in Riga have been watching the slow dissolution of the Baltic State. While our government would have been happy to intervene and save our baltic brothers at any moment, the truth is that the Baltic State acted with inaction and just did nothing as their state slowly collapsed. Now what is left of their government asked for our protection, offering us control over most of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502018;Even if we were reduced to Germany puppet, at least with their help we managed to get our land back and be worthy of being considerd more than a city-state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502019;It was a quiet morning in the Baltic State. No shot was fired, no blood was shed an no scream was heard. It was a well deserved morning, after all this time of turmoil, normalcy has finally returned to the Baltic. But that is not to say that nothing changed. The message was clear for everyone, dissent would not be tolerated and the Germans were there to stay. After surviving against all revolts, the Baltic Military went through quite some changes, going from a mostly mixed army to a mostly German force, with non-Germans serving as auxiliaries to the main, professional, German force that will not hesitate to put down any new revolt. The Baltic people that fought for independence have traded one tyrant for another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
