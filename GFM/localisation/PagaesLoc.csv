accept_belarussians_title;Grant Equal Rights to the White Ruthenians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_belarussians_desc;While far from our height many centuries ago, our recent conquest of White Ruthenia puts our nation in a peculiar position. Even if there were always Slavs in our nation after our independence, now, with the inclusion of our old territories, the White Ruthenians became a sizeable portion of our population, with our people becoming a minority in our own nation. Now, our ministers suggest that the best course of action would be to, instead of letting our peoples fight against each other within our own borders, we should integrate the people of White Ruthenia in our nation, granting them equal rights to Lithuanians and finding unity in our shared history under foreign rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502013;After achieving our independence from the Russians, the Baltic Landtag would hand over power to the military as a temporary measure as our nation started to function as a modern, independent state. But now, as the anniversary of our independence comes near, protests started to appear, with voices asking for more representation and for the army to step down, calling our government "The Landtag of Steel". At first, the unrest was easy to deal with, but as people went to the streets again and again, with even bigger numbers each time. Our ministers advise that if we don't act now, we risk losing control the situation and risking our control over the entire Baltic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502014;Being the most recent addition to the Baltic State, Lithuana had already a pretty sizeable independence movement mobilized. With unrest getting more and more out of control, a bunch of proeminent Lithuanian figures declared independence from us and most of our lithunian troops already defected to this new state. While our first instinct is to kill this new Lithuanian nation right out of its craddle, we have been advised by some of our generals that mobilizing against Lithuania would put our other territories open to further rebellion. Thus, it may be a good idea to let Lithuania go for now, lest we lose Estonia or even Latvia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502015;After a tense week of protests in Estonia, we recieved news that Estonia has been taken by complete chaos, with local regiments mutinying against of rule and joining the calls for representation and independence. It seems that we have completely lost control over Estonia, with drafts of an independence declaration already being writen in Reval. With the lost of most Estonian regiments in our army, we are presented with two options, to either cross into Estonia and try put down their dreams of an independent state or to know that, for now, Estonia and lost and all we can do is to try to crush any dissent in Latvia with the troops that haven't deserted us yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502016;Even after being able to hold Latvia for so long, lost control over most of it. The countryside has long been prone to attacks from guerrilla, but now the Latvian masses have taken control over most major cities, with our Latvian brigades in open mutiny and some of our German troops finding themselves cut off from the government in our capital. We have barely managed to hold Riga, with most of the acess to the city being closed, with the city under martial law. With most of the country falling into enemy hands, we hear about Latvia declaring formal independence in Mitau. The Landtag was called to an emergency session to decide between our options, to fight to our last man, to capitulate to the Latvians or to bunker up in Riga and ask for German help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502017;Our diplomats in Riga have been watching over the situation in the Baltic State as the German government in ther slowly lost control over their territories that once hailed them as liberators. Talks about the slow dissolution of the Baltic State were a hot topic over in our capital, both between our politicians and generals. While our government would have been happy to intervene and save our baltic brothers at any moment, the truth is that the Baltic State acted with inaction and just did nothing as their state slowly collapsed. Now after Latvia declaring independence, what is left of the Baltic government in Riga asked for our protection, offering us control over most of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502018;Even if we were reduced to Germany puppet, at least with their help we managed to get our land back and be worthy of being considerd more than a city-state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502019;As the Sun rose, it was a quiet morning in the Baltic State. After fighting a war agianst itself, the Baltic State finally had a day that no shot was fired and no blood was shed. It was a well deserved morning, after all turmoil, normalcy has finally returned to the Baltic, even if that is not to say that nothing changed. The message was clear for everyone, after quelling revolts all over the country, dissent would not be tolerated and the Germans were here to stay. That was clear when looking at the Baltic Military, once being an army composed from Germans and Baltic natives, after many desertions and purges it became mostly a German force, with non-Germans serving as auxiliaries. Most foreign observers have noted that the Baltic Army became quite a formidable force, that will not hesitate to put down any new revolt that dares to show its ugly head. In the end, the Baltic people that fought for independence have traded their old Russian overlords for German ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GER_sway_the_baltic_title;The Baltic Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_sway_the_baltic_desc;With our victory in the Baltic, our new allies in the East soon will have to choose how their new nation will be governed. As the guarantors of their independence, we naturally hold a great deal of influence with them, being offered to send representatives to the upcoming meeting in Riga. We should decide what will be our agenda in Riga and in which direction we will sway their decision into.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502020;As we decide how to influence our new Baltic allies, some questions emerge on how to influence their future government. Some very vocal voices tell us to take every step to turn them into our puppet, but we probably should act with caution, lest we alienate our new and valuable ally. One of the more reasonable options has been to send the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, an ally of ours that has been invited to bid for the throne by Baltic Monarchists. Furthermore, parts of our delegation recommend instead that we send some liberal agitators to the Baltic to create a more liberal German state to relieve us from unrest. And last but not least, we could send some envoys to their military, suggesting them to take power, for a time, of course...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_strike_first_title;Declare of Baltic Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_strike_first_desc;With the consolidation of Baltic administration and our underhand deal with Berlin struck, we are starting to take steps to make sure Russia can't curtail Baltic autonomy. Our people got in contact with Latvian and Estonian leaders, to talk about the possibility of Baltic independence, and for the nation to stay united as a state of Germans, Latvians and Estonians. Not only did we manage to strike a deal with their leadership, but they also offered to get in contact with some Latvians and Estonians in Dinaburg and Pechory to have them rise up and join the Baltic struggle for independence. Now, with everything ready, all that is left is to cast the die and depose our Russian overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_claim_ingria_desc;§RGain 8 infamy§! When the Baltic was first conquered from Sweden, Peter the Great of Russia handed the ruling of the Baltic to his, very corrupt, right-hand man and governor of Ingria. While he fell from the position even before the governorates were properly estabilished, with our position in the Baltic and independence from Russia secured, the ambitions of our state grew, and Ingria became subject to the interest of war hawks and jingoists alike. With our independence, the Russian government has formally declared the transfer of the Imperial Capital from Saint Petersburg to Moscow, undoing Peter the Great's work, with some arguing that now would be the perfect time to claim Ingria. If we were to seize Ingria and St. Petersburg, we would be pretty much expelling Russia from the Baltic Sea, forever tarnishing the legacy their tsars fought to build.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31502022;Throughout the cities of Vilnius, Riga and Reval, massive crowds had turned out in celebration of the expulsion of Russians from their region! After wrestling their freedom from the maw of the Russian Bear, the Baltics are finally free after almost two centuries of Russian dominance. Today, the Baltic people put aside their differences to relish in their newfound freedom and independence from foreign rule. Though celebratory, the Baltic people remain worried that Moscow will attempt to reconquer the region. Despite the future threats from Moscow, the Baltics have achieved self-determination that will never be vanquished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

unite_poland_galicia_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§! Despite being once a great state in Eastern Europe, after being partitioned time and time again, the Polish people were divided between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Now, with our significant influence in Polish lands, we could not only partially right this wrong, but also strengthen our Polish allies by pushing to unite Poland with Galicia-Lodomeria, while also taking the opportunity to solve some minor claims the Polish have on us. While the Polish people sure will appreciate the unification, the other powers won't be pleased to see us redrawing Eastern Europe in such a way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_duchy_estonia_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! While we were considered by many as a power in decline after the Napoleonic Wars and the loss of Norway, it has become clear that those years of humiliation are behind us. As our nation is once again respected on the world stage, it would only be natural that we start looking into old claims that we could use to solidify our newfound position and prestige. One of the bolder suggestions circulating within our government is that of the Estonian claim. Not only because we held it as a duchy for about a century, but also due to the importance of Estonia in regard to our history - with the legend about the origins of the Dannebog, our flag, in the Battle of Lindanise, during the Livonian Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
