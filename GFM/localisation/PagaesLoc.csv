accept_belarussians_title;Grant Equal Rights to the White Ruthenians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_belarussians_desc;While far from our height many centuries ago, our recent conquest of White Ruthenia puts our nation in a peculiar position. Even if there were always Slavs in our nation after our independence, now, with the inclusion of our old territories, the White Ruthenians became a sizeable portion of our population, with our people becoming a minority in our own nation. Now, our ministers suggest that the best course of action would be to, instead of letting our peoples fight against each other within our own borders, we should integrate the people of White Ruthenia in our nation, granting them equal rights to Lithuanians and finding unity in our shared history under foreign rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502013;After achieving our independence from the Russians, the Baltic Landtag would hand over power to the military as a temporary measure as our nation started to function as a modern, independent state. But now, as the anniversary of our independence comes near, protests started to appear, with voices asking for more representation and for the army to step down, calling our government "The Landtag of Steel". At first, the unrest was easy to deal with, but as people went to the streets again and again, with even bigger numbers each time. Our ministers advise that if we don't act now, we risk losing control the situation and risking our control over the entire Baltic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502014;Being the most recent addition to the Baltic State, Lithuana had already a pretty sizeable independence movement mobilized. With unrest getting more and more out of control, a bunch of proeminent Lithuanian figures declared independence from us and most of our lithunian troops already defected to this new state. While our first instinct is to kill this new Lithuanian nation right out of its craddle, we have been advised by some of our generals that mobilizing against Lithuania would put our other territories open to further rebellion. Thus, it may be a good idea to let Lithuania go for now, lest we lose Estonia or even Latvia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502015;After a tense week of protests in Estonia, we received news that Estonia has been taken by complete chaos, with local regiments mutinying against of rule and joining the calls for representation and independence. It seems that we have completely lost control over Estonia, with drafts of an independence declaration already being writen in Reval. With the lost of most Estonian regiments in our army, we are presented with two options, to either cross into Estonia and try put down their dreams of an independent state or to know that, for now, Estonia and lost and all we can do is to try to crush any dissent in Latvia with the troops that haven't deserted us yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502016;Even after being able to hold Latvia for so long, lost control over most of it. The countryside has long been prone to attacks from guerrilla, but now the Latvian masses have taken control over most major cities, with our Latvian brigades in open mutiny and some of our German troops finding themselves cut off from the government in our capital. We have barely managed to hold Riga, with most of the acess to the city being closed, with the city under martial law. With most of the country falling into enemy hands, we hear about Latvia declaring formal independence in Mitau. The Landtag was called to an emergency session to decide between our options, to fight to our last man, to capitulate to the Latvians or to bunker up in Riga and ask for German help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502017;Our diplomats in Riga have been watching over the situation in the Baltic State as the German government in ther slowly lost control over their territories that once hailed them as liberators. Talks about the slow dissolution of the Baltic State were a hot topic over in our capital, both between our politicians and generals. While our government would have been happy to intervene and save our baltic brothers at any moment, the truth is that the Baltic State acted with inaction and just did nothing as their state slowly collapsed. Now after Latvia declaring independence, what is left of the Baltic government in Riga asked for our protection, offering us control over most of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502018;Even if we were reduced to Germany puppet, at least with their help we managed to get our land back and be worthy of being considerd more than a city-state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502019;As the Sun rose, it was a quiet morning in the Baltic State. After fighting a war agianst itself, the Baltic State finally had a day that no shot was fired and no blood was shed. It was a well deserved morning, after all turmoil, normalcy has finally returned to the Baltic, even if that is not to say that nothing changed. The message was clear for everyone, after quelling revolts all over the country, dissent would not be tolerated and the Germans were here to stay. That was clear when looking at the Baltic Military, once being an army composed from Germans and Baltic natives, after many desertions and purges it became mostly a German force, with non-Germans serving as auxiliaries. Most foreign observers have noted that the Baltic Army became quite a formidable force, that will not hesitate to put down any new revolt that dares to show its ugly head. In the end, the Baltic people that fought for independence have traded their old Russian overlords for German ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GER_sway_the_baltic_title;The Baltic Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_sway_the_baltic_desc;With our victory in the Baltic, our new allies in the East soon will have to choose how their new nation will be governed. As the guarantors of their independence, we naturally hold a great deal of influence with them, being offered to send representatives to the upcoming meeting in Riga. We should decide what will be our agenda in Riga and in which direction we will sway their decision into.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502020;As we decide how to influence our new Baltic allies, some questions emerge on how to influence their future government. Some very vocal voices tell us to take every step to turn them into our puppet, but we probably should act with caution, lest we alienate our new and valuable ally. One of the more reasonable options has been to send the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, an ally of ours that has been invited to bid for the throne by Baltic Monarchists. Furthermore, parts of our delegation recommend instead that we send some liberal agitators to the Baltic to create a more liberal German state to relieve us from unrest. And last but not least, we could send some envoys to their military, suggesting them to take power, for a time, of course...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_strike_first_title;Declare of Baltic Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_strike_first_desc;With the consolidation of Baltic administration and our underhand deal with Berlin struck, we are starting to take steps to make sure Russia can't curtail Baltic autonomy. Our people got in contact with Latvian and Estonian leaders, to talk about the possibility of Baltic independence, and for the nation to stay united as a state of Germans, Latvians and Estonians. Not only did we manage to strike a deal with their leadership, but they also offered to get in contact with some Latvians and Estonians in Dinaburg and Pechory to have them rise up and join the Baltic struggle for independence. Now, with everything ready, all that is left is to cast the die and depose our Russian overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UBD_claim_ingria_desc;§RGain 8 infamy§! When the Baltic was first conquered from Sweden, Peter the Great of Russia handed the ruling of the Baltic to his, very corrupt, right-hand man and governor of Ingria. While he fell from the position even before the governorates were properly established, with our position in the Baltic and independence from Russia secured, the ambitions of our state grew, and Ingria became subject to the interest of war hawks and jingoists alike. With our independence, the Russian government has formally declared the transfer of the Imperial Capital from Saint Petersburg to Moscow, undoing Peter the Great's work, with some arguing that now would be the perfect time to claim Ingria. If we were to seize Ingria and St. Petersburg, we would be pretty much expelling Russia from the Baltic Sea, forever tarnishing the legacy their tsars fought to build.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31502022;Throughout the cities of Vilnius, Riga and Reval, massive crowds had turned out in celebration of the expulsion of Russians from their region! After wrestling their freedom from the maw of the Russian Bear, the Baltics are finally free after almost two centuries of Russian dominance. Today, the Baltic people put aside their differences to relish in their newfound freedom and independence from foreign rule. Though celebratory, the Baltic people remain worried that Moscow will attempt to reconquer the region. Despite the future threats from Moscow, the Baltics have achieved self-determination that will never be vanquished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

unite_poland_galicia_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§! Despite being once a great state in Eastern Europe, after being partitioned time and time again, the Polish people were divided between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Now, with our significant influence in Polish lands, we could not only partially right this wrong, but also strengthen our Polish allies by pushing to unite Poland with Galicia-Lodomeria, while also taking the opportunity to solve some minor claims the Polish have on us. While the Polish people sure will appreciate the unification, the other powers won't be pleased to see us redrawing Eastern Europe in such a way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_duchy_estonia_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! While we were considered by many as a power in decline after the Napoleonic Wars and the loss of Norway, it has become clear that those years of humiliation are behind us. As our nation is once again respected on the world stage, it would only be natural that we start looking into old claims that we could use to solidify our newfound position and prestige. One of the bolder suggestions circulating within our government is that of the Estonian claim. Not only because we held it as a duchy for about a century, but also due to the importance of Estonia in regard to our history - with the legend about the origins of the Dannebog, our flag, in the Battle of Lindanise, during the Livonian Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_duchy_estonia_title;Reclaim the Duchy of Estland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
subdue_baltic_desc;With our recent defeats in the Baltic, we took a significant blow to our international status. The annexation of the Baltic in the Great Northern War under Peter the Great centuries ago elevated Russia into a true European power and, while the loss of the Baltic won't undermine our position as major player in European politics, we can't deny that it left a sour taste in our mouths. To remedy that, we could reassert our position in the Baltic Sea and claim that the Baltic states do not deserve independence and are still an integral part of our territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC49511A;With our increased influence in Scandinavia, the matter of the North Atlantic Islands has increasibly come to the attention of our government. While Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands were awarded to Denmark after the loss of Norway in 1814, they are now under our indirect control. This has prompted some of our advisors to suggest that we should take direct control of them, thus ensuring that we would retain absolute control over the North Atlantic in the event of our Scandinavian allies breaking away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49512A;Our new overlords have moved to seize Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_greece_title;Unite Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_greece_desc;Ever since the end of the Byzantine Empire, the Greek people have never been unified into a single nation. While Attica and Peloponnese managed to be part of the new Greek nation, Greeks in the Aegean sea and Anatolia weren't so lucky, even if some of them recently managed to free themselves from Turkish overlordship. Now, with our control over Greece, the Greek people of the Aegean and Anatolia are skeptical of joining Greece, wary of our presence in the country. But, if we managed to increase our influence in these new states we could, in theory, make so their governments agree to join our Greek vassals, letting our puppet grow in strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC84205832;With our recent victories in the Caucasus against the Circassians and Dagestanis, our governance of the region came into question. While our "divide and conquer" strategies have been quite effective, the advisors to the Tsar have long since talked about how the Caucasus Namestnik needs some more oversight, with charges of corruption and incompetence being present since the we first left Karl Knorring in charge of the region. Now the question stands, should we further integrate the Namestnik, or should we let our viceroys have autonomy to expand the Russian hold in the region?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ITA_create_yugoslavia_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! The Balkans have always been a playground for foreign empires. As we strive to prove ourselves as a true great power in Europe, we seek a sphere of influence of our own, with the Balkans emerging as the most promising target. By expanding our influence in the region, we can strip the Austrians and Turks of territory while creating allies who will be forever indebted to us, securing our place as the Masters of the Adriatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RUS_create_yugoslavia_desc;§RGain 8 infamy§! The Balkans have always been a playground for foreign empires. Populated by South Slavic peoples, the region naturally falls within our sphere of influence, with many viewing us as brothers and liberators due to our role in freeing them from the Ottoman Empire. If we were to complete the liberation of the South Slavic people from the Ottoman and Austrian Empires, we could not only create a powerful ally but also gain access to a route that bypasses the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, allowing us to establish a naval presence in the Mediterranean Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS_create_yuguslavia_title;Quelling the Powder Keg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS_create_yuguslavia_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! The Balkans have always been a playground for foreign empires, including ourselves. We have long held an interest in the region, demonstrated by our control over Croatia and our rivalry with the Ottomans. While we have previously stated that we hold no interest in further expansion, the rise of nationalism has turned the Balkans into a powder keg waiting to explode. If we were to reassert our position, we might be able to organize the region in a way that quells the nationalist fires threatening to destabilize our empire in the future - even if it means angering Russia in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800800;As our position in the Balkans is secured, our troops move into the region and prepare to enforce the new borders being drawn in $CAPITAL$. Now, all that remains is to decide how we want the borders of the region to look. The only certainty is that we are to take control of Dalmatia and Vlorë and that there is to be a South Slavic state. However, the size of this nation remains a matter of discussion, as we may wish to strip it of some territory to make the region easier to control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800801;As our position in the Balkans is secured, our troops move into the region and prepare to enforce the new borders being drawn in $CAPITAL$. Now, all that remains is to decide how we want the borders of the region to look. While most of our advisors and supporters favor a strong South Slavic state, it may be in our best interest to break it up into smaller states so that they are easier to control while still remaining loyal allies in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800802;With the separation of Bulgaria from Belgrade, the matter of Macedonia has come to our attention. The region is a melting pot of Serbian, Bulgarian, and Albanian peoples and is claimed by both our new allies in Belgrade and by Bulgaria. Both parties have requested that we grant them definitive control over the region, which contains the port of Solun — a vital asset we plan to use to bypass the straits that confine us to the Black Sea. While the region has traditionally been part of Bulgaria, we could grant it to Belgrade as compensation for the loss of Bulgaria itself and other territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800803;As our position in the Balkans is secured, our troops move into the region and prepare to enforce the new borders being drawn in $CAPITAL$. Now, all that remains is to decide how we want the borders of the region to look. Our plan is to annex Bosnia and then create a nominal South Slavic state by uniting Serbia and Montenegro under our supervision - turning a potential enemy into a permanent ally. Some of our advisors have even suggested annexing Belgrade and Montenegro outright, leaving Yugoslavia with only Serbia, with the possibility of integrating Bulgaria into it at a later stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_annex_sardinia_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Ever since our hegemony over Italy was established, our nation has only benefited — diplomatically, by having the entire peninsula as our ally, and economically, through French investors dominating Italy’s mines and factories. One such place is Sardinia. With its profitable mines and proximity to French Corsica, our investors have taken control of most of the economy on this otherwise isolated island. As a result, there has been growing outcry in Paris over the idea of annexing the island to secure its valuable resources. However, that is not to say the proposal has gone unopposed—many advisors argue that Sardinia has long been isolated from the rest of Italy and has a strong history of resisting outside influence. Still, our far-reaching economic presence may be a promising sign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800804;Following the crushing defeat by the French and the Treaty of New York, as if the loss of Louisiana was not enough, the French have also demanded that Texas and California join their puppet government in Mexico City, effectively restoring Mexico to its pre-1836 borders before the loss of Texas and the Mexico-American War. \n\nThe only positive outcome is that the Anglo-Canadians have petitioned to join the Union as the state of Ontario - we will certainly need their help in reclaiming our destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1316087;While we were aware of the Sino-Japanese war happening to our south, our advisors believed that Imperial China would deal a significant blow to Japan's territorial ambition, but the Japanese have shocked the world by emerging triumphant. In the aftermath of their victory, Japan has imposed on China the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which not only ends Korea's status as a Chinese vassal, but also cedes to Japan the island of Formosa and—more importantly—the Liaodong Peninsula, in Manchuria. \n\nThese developments pose a severe threat to our own interests in Manchuria. To resolve this, we could leverage support from Paris and Berlin to demand the Japanese withdraw from Liaodong, preventing their further encroachment on our sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316088;While our triumph over China is indeed an awe-inspiring feat, the resultant rising of our country to a regional powerhouse has not pleased some of our neighbors—notably the Russians. Today, we received a message from Russia demanding our withdrawal from the Liaodong Peninsula, threatening a multi-national coalition if we do not comply—hinting that the other great powers have pledged military support. While we were always wary of Russian ambition in the Far East, we did not imagine that a potential war would with them would come so quickly. Some of our advisors suggest we call their bluff and refuse to withdraw from Liaodong, but others suggest we accept their demands,  which would in turn curry favor with the rest of the great powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316187;As reports continue to arrive about the Japanese victory against China, we have received an envoy from the Russian Tsar, asking for our support in their intervention against Japan. Russia argues that if the treaty is not reverted by Japan either willingly or under threat of force, not only will their sphere of influence in the Far East be at stake, but our own presence in Asia as well. With the combined might of Russia, Germany and France, Japan is likely to back down. Russia would then be happy to return the favor by diplomatically supporting our colonial ambitions once this geopolitical tension ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316188;Our threat of intervention has been successful. Japan has agreed to return Liaodong to China and withdraw all its forces from Manchuria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316287;Japan has refused to withdraw from Liaodong, either believing our threats are insincere or that they can best our forces in battle. Whatever the reason for their insolence, we are prepared for war, and our allies are ready to join us once we make the call to arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316088;We have been informed that Russia, not pleased with their southern island neighbors' encroachment into Manchuria, has forced Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula to us, with the only condition being that we pay Japan an additional 30 million taels in compensation. This is hardly an expense to us, considering the 200 million taels we already owe them as war reparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800806;As our influence in the Far East grew and our need for expanding into warmer waters became clear, the concept of "Yellow Russia" started to form, first as to describe the mix of Russian and Asian culture in our far eastern territories and then, as China grew weaker and weaker, as a plan to expand into Chinese territory, especially Manchuria. Now, with Inner Manchuria under our direct control, we can finally consolidate the concept of Yellow Russia, with our advisors discussing if we should integrate Manchuria directly into our nation or let if be run by a viceroy to better manage this colonial project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

yellow_russia_gansu_desc;With our control over Xinjiang and Mongolia, we are almost reaching the final borders we planned for Zheltorossiya. What remains is to push through the Gansu province, so that our border follows the Yellow River. That would certainly make defense of the region easier, but contrary to the rest of Zheltorossiya, Gansu is densely populated, making it harder to control than the rest of Zheltorossiya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800805;After some initial outcry, it seems that Poland has calmed somewhat after the unrest caused by the massacre in Warsaw. However, it appears the Poles were drafting a proposal full of reforms to guarantee Poland’s security. The reforms are quite radical — calling for the restoration of Congress Poland and the Constitution of 1830, albeit with significant compromises meant to appease us and make it more difficult for Poland to rebel. \n\nNow, our advisors are now left to discuss these controversial proposals. Unsurprisingly, most of them have expressed deep distrust toward the Poles, but some have pointed out that restoring Poland could serve as a tool to undermine German control over regions such as Poznan and Galicia. In any case, this move by the Polish reveals a certain level of organization — indicating that there may be consequences if we ignore their their "suggestions".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800824;With our hegemony over the Baltic, it has come to our attention that—while we have the government in Riga as a puppet—there is also Lithuania, the once-mighty Grand Duchy, now greatly reduced in size. Now that we hold significant influence over both states, we have a decision to consider. \n\nThere has been some discussion among our advisors regarding the region. One group supports recent requests from the government in Riga, asking us to hand Lithuania over to them. While this would undoubtedly strengthen Riga’s position, it would also increase their autonomy—even if they had to face some initial discontent from the Lithuanian population. On the other hand, a few advisors have pointed out that Lithuania, though diminished, could have its claims supported by us. This would allow us to significantly expand its territory, turning it into a valuable ally—one that remains firmly under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the pacification of the area now complete, our next step is to encourage Russian settlement—taking advantage of the vast expanses of fertile land in northern and eastern Kazakhstan, even at the cost of disrupting nomadic routes and driving the Kazakhs our of their traditional grazing pastures, leaving them open to be transformed into Russian farms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This does not mean, however, that the winds of German nationalism have subsided, on the contrary, it remains the most serious threat to our hold over the Confederation. To secure our dominance, we could assert control over the Federal Convention in Frankfurt, enabling us to shape legislation that would entrench—and even expand—our hegemony over Germany without opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are many states for us to consider, one of the most pressing ones would be the Rhineland. The lands along the Rhine have seen a significant boom in industrialization, which would greatly benefit our empire. Thus, we have put forth a proposal in the Federal Convention, to establish the Ruhr Industrial Commission which would, on paper,further boost industrialization in the Ruhr but, in reality, it would give us total control over the Rhenish affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now that we hold control over the Federal Convention in Frankfurt, we can begin reorganizing Germany to secure our hegemony over the German Confederation. While there are many states for us to consider, it recently came to our attention the matter of the duchy of Westphalia and the Hesse states. Westphalia has been under the control of a Habsburg noble ever since the end of the war against Prussia. But now, with our control over Frankfurt, we may change that. This time, one of our advisors has giving the idea of ordering the Duke of Westphalia to resign and partition his land between the states of Hesse, on the condition that they band together in the Union of Hesse-Westphalia and, of course, be loyal to us afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are many states to consider, it is time we turn our attention to the Free and Hanseatic Cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck. These cities aligned themselves with Prussia, giving us more than enough justification to simply incorporate them into Hanover and Mecklenburg. However, doing so would undoubtedly alienate many of the smaller states within the Confederation—most of which also sided with Prussia. Instead, we shall reform the Hanseatic League, uniting the three cities into a single state. This new entity will receive greater autonomy within the German Confederation, while still remaining subordinate to its executive authority—our emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there are many states to consider, the matter of the Saxon states now calls for our attention. The Kingdom of Saxony has long been our ally, with the Austrian Emperor having protected it from annexation by Prussia during the Congress of Vienna. It is now time to reward Saxony and ensure it remains within our sphere of influence—by uniting Thuringia with its kingdom. In doing so, we not only reward Saxony for its loyalty but also grant it jurisdiction over the Thuringian duchies—most of which sided with Prussia during our war against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Duchy of Mecklenburg was an ally of Prussia, but there is no need to punish them. Instead, to guarantee their loyalty, we could unite them with the smaller Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, while also getting some concessions from them that would give us control over them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

martial_law_brandenburg_desc;§RGain 12.5 infamy§! Now that we hold control over the Federal Convention in Frankfurt, we can begin reorganizing Germany to secure our hegemony over the German Confederation. While there are many states to consider, an urgent matter is that of Brandenburg and Pomerania. Both states have been separated from Prussia and are currently under heavy oversight by both our Empire and the German Confederation. Needless to say, our control over the region is unstable—these lands were long held by the Hohenzollerns, and resistance to our rule is to be expected. Fortunately, one of our advisors has devised a plan: to forge a conspiracy suggesting that Brandenburg intends to return to Hohenzollern rule. This would provide us with the justification to declare martial law over both Brandenburg and Pomerania, allowing us to seize permanent control of the duchies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800825;With our victory over Prussia, it has been reduced to little more than a rump state in the Baltic, a far cry from the days they were a contender for the throne of Germany. But, it seems that their situation is about to get worse. \n\nWith unrest brewing in Poland, the Polish population in Prussia seems to also have some strong desires for independence, as do the ones under Russian rule. But, seeing our treatment of the Polish people, a secretive delegation of Polish partisans from the province of Poznan has come to talk to us, asking for our support to start a Polish uprising in Greater Poland, promising to be loyal to us after their independence from Prussia, as long as they are granted some autonomy. Naturally, we were a bit skeptical of their offer, but they seem like a good opportunity to cripple the Prussians further, even if it will take some time for their revolt to actually start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800826;As unrest brews in Russian Poland, it seems that we aren't immune to the growing Polish agitation. Much to the contrary, it would seem that, the Grand Duchy of Poznan, which is majority Polish, has followed the winds of Polish nationalism and declared independence from us, with the government in Vienna being the first to declare support to it. \n\nWe cannot overstate how much this hurts us. The loss of Poznan would mean the loss of a third of a remaining territory, but fighting against the uprising would mean fighting against the Austrians again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800827;With the provisional government in Poznan being able to achieve their independence, our diplomats have already began talks with its representatives, the same which came to our capital months ago. Luckily, it seems that they are happy to follow through their end of the deal, letting us help "guide", especially in foreign affairs, turning them effectively into our puppet. Other than that, it is clear that the these revolutionaries have been emboldened by our support, suggesting us that they could even form a loyal government in Warsaw for a united Polish state, if the situation allows it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800828;With the release of non-German lands from the Austrian Empire, it seems that there were left some loose ends by the Polish border. On the border, lies the city of Frauenstadt, known as Wadowice in Polish. The city, despite being part of the German Confederation, is still claimed by the Polish, with a significant Polish majority. Maybe it is for the better that we let the Polish have the city, to preserve relations with these newly established states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800829;After 300 years of Habsburg rule over Bohemia, it has become one of the richest regions of our Empire and even part of the first German Confederation, despite being a mostly Slavic region. It has been part of the German world for about 800 years, ever since the Holy Roman Empire, being one of its electors, being influenced by and even influencing Germany at some point, with Bohemian kings being elected Holy Roman Emperor for a time. But, despite these 800 years of contact with Germany, the Czechs remain mostly Slavic, with German being spoken mostly in Prag and the borderlands. \n\n Now, with the issue of Bohemia dominating the Federal Convention, it is time to decide: do we put our efforts into integrating Bohemia and its people despite the turmoil it may cause? Or do we save ourselves the hassle and finally let them go, granting them special autonomy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800830;After another triumphal victory against France, our troops occupy the most of the eastern bank of the Meuse. But, beyond the river, sits Belgium, a state meant to act as a buffer between us and France. Now, with another victory against the French, Belgium's existence as a buffer proves to hardly deter the conflict between our nations. Perhaps it is time that we end this little "Belgium Experiment" that has been ongoing to this day, either by separating Flanders from Wallonia or even taking Wallonia for ourselves and giving Flanders to the Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800831;Years after the Franco-Prussian War, we finally scored a triumphal victory against Germany! The Germans tried to take Lorraine from us, but ended up paying a heavy price for their hubris. While we could be happy with just Alsace-Loirrane, with such a victory, we can't help but rekindle our old ambitions on the Rhine. Our troops are already occupying the west bank of the river, with some of our advisors saying we should share pieces of Germany with the Benelux countries, to draw them into war with Germany as well, in case of a future war. On the other hand, we could just have the Rhine for ourselves. Despite that, shockingly, we recieve a proposal from the Russian Foreign Relations Minister, suggesting that we take only the Palatinate, giving Northern Rhineland to our Belgium allies, significantly strengthening them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800855;After a long period of integration, today we finally welcome a another state in our union! $COUNTRY$ has the privilege of growing while unifying the opressed peoples of Eastern Europe, with representatives coming to our capital to become part of our government and ratify their last treaty before they are properly integrated into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800832;With our hegemony over the new German Confederation and our oversight over the Rhineland and Hesse, some of our advisors are suggesting that we make some minor adjustments to the our border with these two states, guaranteeing a border with Frankfurt itself and keep control over the Bavarian Palatinate. Seeing as the Rhineland's ownership of the Palatinate was always meant to be temporary and the dukes of Hesse have properly been compensated with lands in Westphalia, redrawing the border would be met with little to no resistance from them. \n\nThis would be done by annexing these regions into the South German Confederation, which we hold a tighter grip on—being ruled directly from Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800833;With the recent release of the non-German lands of the Austrian Empire, we can't deny that some matters were left unresolved. Today, it came to our attention that, despite now being united, Dalmatia and Croatia were never formally united after the release of the Kingdom of Croatia. Croatia was originally under Hungary and the Crown of Saint Stephen, separated from Dalmatia, with it being its own kingdom conquered by Austria during the Napoleonic Wars. \n\nNow we are left to decided the status of Croatia. Are we legitimizing the union with Dalmatia? Or maybe we could even reunite Croatia with Hungary, now that the Revolutions of 1848 are behind us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800834;Now that the matter of Croatia is resolved, there is still a loose end that we need to deal with, the fate of Sankt Veit, a city in the Adriatic Coast which was originally part of Croatia, but that we retained control, to guarantee our presence in the Adriatic. But now that we consolidated our rule over Germany we have to decided if we are to officially annex Sankt Veit into Germany or if we will return it to the Kingdom of Croatia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800835;When we were liberated from the Russians, we thought that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would just become our new overlords. But to our surprise, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared support our claims in White Ruthenia, restoring the borders drawn by Napoleon in 1812! \n\nWhile obvious that this is just $FROMCOUNTRY$ seeking to expand their influence through us, it is still promising to see them supporting us instead of establishing a Ruthenian state or even integrating us in a Baltic union...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800836;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have refused our offer, leaving our issues around the spheres of influence in the East Indies unresolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800837;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered us a deal in which they would give us their colony in the Gold Coast and, in return, we would recognize their control over the island of Borneo, in the East Indies. While we know that their colony in the Gold Coast became unprofitable, we have no doubt that it would be different under our rule, as it would be integrated into our colony in the region. But, about Borneo, while we don't have such a significant presence in the regiom it still leaves a sourt taste in our mouths to hand it over to the Dutch, since that would mean stripping James Brooke, the White Rajah of Sarawak, of his rightful lands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800838;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have accepted our offer! Taking the costly colony in the Gold Coast from us, in return from total hegemony over the island of Borneo! We shall be quick consolidate our rule over the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211607;Today, we recieved a messa from $FROMCOUNTRY$ stating that they are interested in buying Heligoland. The island fell into our ownership during the Napoleonic Wars, and now, many years after our initial occupation, the place has become little more than a vacation spot and a refuge for liberal thinkers from the continent, having little strategic value to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211608;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have agreed to sell Heligoland to us! We already shipped them their payment and sent a small garrison to guarantee control over the island. It won't take long to fully incorporate the island into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211609;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused to sell Heligoland to us! It seems they are far too attached to this glorified rock-turned-vacation spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
buy_heligoland_title;The Heligoland Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
buy_heligoland_desc;The island of Heligoland is a small island off the coast of Germany, traditionally considered part of Schleswig or the Frisian Islands. With our control over the Frisian Islands, we maybe could try to buy Heligoland from the British. The island is small and over the years—instead of becoming a naval base—it evolved into a vacation spot and safe haven for German liberals, so they wouldn't mind handing them over to us—for a small price, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800839;After a decisive victory against the British, the Dutch have returned to South Africa, setting up shop in Cape, as they did before the Napoleonic Wars. While the Dutch are technically our kin, the tyranny of the VOC caused our ancestors to be alienated into fleeing from their rule. But now, with the end of the VOC and their victory against the British, it may be a good idea to reunite with them, guaranteeing our safety and acess to their markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800840;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has invited us to unite them in preparation to joining the Dutch once again. While we are a bit held back by the proposal, seeing that our ancestors had to flee from VOC rule, this was a long time ago and the VOC is long dead, so it may be worth a shot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800841;Ever since our reconquest of the Cape, our eyes have turned towards the Boer states around the Drakensberg Range. The Boer were once dutchmen employed by the VOC, but released of their contracts to settle the Cape. Along the years, the rule of the VOC proved to be pretty unpopular, causing them to leave the Cape and migrate away from big cities in droves. But now, as we were deciding what to do with the Boer states, a Voltrekeer delegation has visited our administration in Kaap and petitioned the annexation of the South African Republic and its incorporation into our great nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENGFREDESC;After centuries being ruled from London, we are once again free from the English yoke! But now that we are finally free to pursue our own path, we can't deny that the English left a significant vacuum in the governance of our nation. \n\nThat is why, if we are to enter the world stage and become a proper nation once again, we need to answer an important question: what is the source of legitimate power in our new nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31502001;As the dust finally settles and our new government gets into place, there is one last question that we must tackle, the so called "German Question". While we are greatful for both external and internal German support for our independence, now that we are free, we can't deny that the German minority could pose a treat to our state in the future. While they transfered the governance of the Baltic nation has passed on to the Baltic people, the Baltic Germans still enjoy quite a lot of privileges and we fear that, with the rise of nationalism in Europe, they will strive to join Germany, which would—with no doubt—undermine the Baltic natives if they were to succeed. It may be prudent to start to crackdown on their power before they can start conspiring against out nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800843;Our diplomat in Riga informs us that, amidst the current economic crisis happening in our Baltic allies, the German elite in Riga came to us with a offer, to have us bail Riga out of this economic disaster and, in turn, having it be incorporated into our nation. \n\nWhile it looks like a pretty good deal, it is obvious that it would alienate our Baltic allies beyond repair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800844;While we still recover from our current economic situation, we are met with a small $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ fleet trying to dock into Riga. While we usually could tolerate an unexpected visit from the Germans, this time it is different, the Germans have informed us that they just bought Riga after brief negotiations with the local German government and the city is now theirs. We can't deny that such a betrayal is devastating, especially in our current situation, but know we are left with two options: accepting letting the Germans take over the city or leave it clear that Riga is not for sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800845;While we still recover from our current economic situation, we got the news that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has offered to send us a considerable ammount of money to help us get back on our feet. Obviously, some of that help is to be sent directly towards the Germans living in our nation, but the rest is all ours to enjoy, to pay our debts or to invest into getting our economy out of this mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800846;With our fleet trying to dock into Riga, we had a small exchange with the Baltic government, where they left clear that despite what the local government said, Riga is not for sale. While that doesn't surprise us, we still can't deny that the germans in Riga desire to be ruled by us. At this point, we could either cut our losses or strike down our old allies and not let them rule themselves anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800847;With the recent economic ruin we are facing, our government is struggling to get our economy in order. With our people suffering, some of our advisors have started talks with our German allies, and it seems that the German diplomats have thrown around the idea of asking our allies for a bail. While this could literally save our economy, it wouldn't be for free, the German diplomats have insinuated that such a bail would come with our liberty as its price...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800848;Observing the current economic downturn in the Baltic Duchy, our diplomats in Riga saw an opportunity to increase our influence in our ally, managing to convince the Baltic government to offer us a deal: we bail them off of their current debts and, in return, they will let us have oversight over their government—turining them into our puppets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800849;Our allies have accepted to bail us out. With our coffers swelling with the German relief, we can't help but wonder if that is worth all of that was worth giving our liberty away. We can just hope now that the non-German population in our nation doesn't get too upset about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800850;Despite our generous offer, the German government has refused to bail us out. Maybe they are not as well off as we thought, or maybe they are doing us a favor letting us handle our situation ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800851;Ever since our independence, our ties with Germany have been strong. And, with the special place Germans have in our nation, it would seems that a few germans began to immigrate to our nation. While we certainly could are glad to get more people, we can't deny that too much migration could lead to some conflict with with the local Baltic population in the future in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800852;With our ruler being also the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, our connections with the German nobility are strong. Because of that, recently, some nobles from our ruler's homeland have decided to settle in the Baltic, joining the rest of the German immigrants that are slowly settling in the Baltic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800853;While the Hanseatic League is long dead, we have a long history with it. Reval, Pernau and even our capital, Riga, have all been part of Hanseatic League in the past, because of that, we have been working on creating a bond with Bremen, Lubeck and Hamburg in Germany, with those being the last "Hanseatic" cities remaining. Now, after months of negotiations, we managed to strike a deal with such cities, sigining a treaty allowing the free movement of workers between these old Hanseatic cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

welcome_the_romanians_desc;After a total transformation of our nation into a Danubian Federation, the Romanians already have a place in our nation, due to them being the dominant population in Transylvania.

welcome_the_polish_desc;With our union with the Slavic people, one of the biggest slavic groups in our nation are the Polish. Naturally, ever since the partitions of Poland, we ruled over a significant Polish minority, keeping it even as Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw. Now, with the Polish becoming members of our Austro-Slavic nation, we have the change to protect the Polish from both Prussian and Russian threats, by integrating them into our nation once we manage to hold enough sway over them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800854;With the success of our revolution against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy, we give light to a new era for our people. But now, with the rise of Socialism, it seems that a new wave of ideas has have hit our nation. While these new ideas are still a minority in our government, we can't deny that the winds of change are upon us and—with the liberal mindset that sparkled the Revolutions of 1848 becoming the new status quo—we have no doubt that the socialists are here to stay, as new faction pushing political change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

truly_baltic_desc;§RGain 10 infamy§! Despite enjoying German help to fight the Russians, we couldn't risk having the Germans taking the place of the Russians as our new overlords. Because of that, the revolution was born, with the Baltic people storming the Landtag and declaring the creation of $COUNTRY$. Despite that, we can't deny that Germany still holds lots of sway over our nation, bringing some question to the legitimacy of our regime. So, to quell any doubts about the sovereignty of $COUNTRY$, we shall prove ourselves to be a truly Baltic republic, by claiming Prussia, leaving it clear once and for all that we aren't mere subservient to Berlin. \n\n§RPulling yourself out of German protection is a dangerous game for the player, especially if you are a Radical Republic!

EVTDESC800856;As the dust settles from our conquest of Prussia, there grows the speculation about what is the next step for our great nation.

EVTDESC73649209;After the last Schleswig War, the Austrian Empire promissed us that it would realize a referendum in Schleswig at a later date, to let the population decide if they truly wanted to become a part of Germany, seeing as it has a significant Danish population. Thus, when war broke out between it and Prussia, we feared that that promise may soon be null and void, as Austria would be unable to fulfill if it was defeated but, int a surprising turn of events, Austria has managed to keep their position as head of the German world and thus, maybe it is a good time to ask about that referenfum they promised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800859;After solidifying our position in Korea, it was only natural that our next target would be Manchuria. When we first rose to great power status, Manchuria was firmly under Russian influence. However, after a violent takeover of the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway, we succeeded in replacing them as the informal overlord of the region, establishing the South Manchuria Railway Company—Mantetsu. \n\nThe company gradually came to dominate Manchurian affairs, culminating in our invasion of the region and, with Manchuria under our control, our advisors have presented a plan to use Mantetsu to develop it into a true crown jewel of our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800860;Being completely expelled from Manchuria, our investments in the region have been seized, leaving the Mantetsu defunct and making it cease its operations, forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800862;With our victory against Russia and the expulsion of Slavs from the Far East, it is about time we decide on how our gains will be administered. While most of the Far East would be either directly ruled as a colony or be run by local semi-independent governments, Outer Manchuria brings us an interesting question. Some executives in the Home Islands have been pushing for Outer Manchuria to be integrated into our puppet goverment in Manchuria, so the Mantetsu and its subsidiaries are able to operate freely on it. \n\nWhile we aren't totally opposed to this idea, with the effort we put into annexing the territory and expelling the Russians from it, we can't say that we are eager to hand it over to our puppet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now, with our invasion of Manchuria, the Mantetsu became an essential part of our occupation of the region, not only becoming responsible for around 25% of our tax revenue, but also deeply penetrating every sphere of everyday life for Japanese settlers in Manchuria. \n\nNow, with the rise of Mangyo, most of Mantetsu investment has been absorved and repurposed into serving the developing Manchurian economy, Mantetsu's role has been devolved mainly into its railway lines, planning and research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800863;Mantetsu has served us well in furthering our interests in Manchuria and being a profitable company in our nation, one of our most profitable enterprise actually. But now—with our Invasion of Manchuria—we need to evolve our economic policy in Manchuria, such as to properly build it as a nation, despite still being, in practice our colony. Thus—after some small disagreements with the Kwantung Army—Yoshisuke Aikawa, founder of the Nissan zaibatsu, has established the Manchurian Industrial Development Company, integrating a great deal of Mantetsu's investments. Now, despite still operating its railway lines and its research wing their profits have diminished quite a bit, Luckily, we can still count on it to showcase the modernization of Manchuria under our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mantetsu_research_wing;Mantetsu Research Wing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mantetsu_research_wing_desc;The Mantetsu engaged in a country-wide development project, with not only its Research Wing being a center piece of Japan's colonial program, but also devoloping the country's heavy industry and soybean agriculture, with land cultivation increasing in 70% in 20 years, not to mention the construction of schools, libraries and hospitals promoted by the Mantetsu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800864;With the formation of the Mantetsu, a considerable investment has been put into Manchuria. The railway lines were the first to be developed, together with hotels and warehouses to service them. After that, the Mantetsu built schools, libraries and even hospitals, with a wave of development into mining and agricultre following suit, headed by the Mantetsu Research Wing.\n\nBeing considered the centerpiece of Japan's colonial policy in Manchuria, the Mantetsu Research Wing is paramount to the development of our government. \n\nWhile it is mostly focused on agricultural developments for now, we have no doubt that we can only benefit from the brightest minds in Japan putting their heads into developing Manchuria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800865;The Chosen Government Railway, also known as Sentetsu, was established after our annexation of Korea, from Korea's old military railways nationalized at the orders of the Japanese Resident-General of Korea. \n\nAlthough the Sentetsu has grown quite a bit since its creation—integrating smaller private railways lines—the Sentetsu is nowhere near the level of the Mantetsu in Manchuria. Thus, we are giving the Mantetsu jurisdiction over the Sentetsu, in hopes that the South Manchuria Railway Company can modernize the Sentetsu's locomotives while expanding its fleet. \n\nWithout a doubt, the integration between these railways lines can only bring good to our nation, especially if it means bringing the Sentetsu to Mantetsu's standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800866;The Asia Express was a super express passenger train operated by the Mantetsu, quickly becoming its most iconic train and the fastest one in all of Asia at the time. With American reporters praising its speed and luxurious comfort, it was a showcase of Japanese technology and the advancements made by the Mantetsu, being one of the world's first locomotives to have fully enclosed and air-condioned carriages. \n\nThe Asia Express served as the Mantetsu's greatest piece of propaganda, not only showing its developments in Manchuria, but also becoming its greatest symbol, making so the company—together with the Asia Express—would live on the public consciousness for years to come—even well after Japan is expelled from Mainland Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800867;With the Japanese Invasion of Manchuria and the propping up of $COUNTRY$, the economy of our state becomes of primary importance to the Japanese government, with Japanese officials recognizing that a poor economy would be a breeding ground for anti-Japanese and communist elements.
