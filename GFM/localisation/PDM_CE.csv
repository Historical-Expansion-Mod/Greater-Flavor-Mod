CE_NAME;The Concert of Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CE_DESC;Napoleon has died, but his legacy still shakes Europe. The empires of the Americas are shattered, and the empires of Europe hear the first rumbles in a gathering storm of nationalism. The Vienna Congress that brought the Napoleonic Wars to an end was meant to restore the old monarchical order, but the concert of balanced powers it sought to establish is already looking precarious. Whichever nations can seize this moment will dominate a new age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rather than insist upon unification with all Greek-speaking peoples in the region, our government could officially renounce its claims to any contested territories in Anatolia.

primus_inter_pares_desc;The kings of Hungary are considered to be first among equals within the aristocracy, and have rarely held absolute power. Even in the middle ages our kings were elected to their position by the Estates. During later times certain aristocrats even gained the right of insurgency, should the king behave tyrannically. Now, at the dawn of this new age, the evolution of state, government and political parties make reform necessary. It is time for our monarch, in accordance with the Estates, to give a constitution to His people, and lead us into a new chapter of Hungarian history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

dalmatian_patrimony_desc;After King Laszlo I conquered Croatia and and formed a personal union with its crown, the Dalmatian Coast spent centuries in the Hungarian sphere of influence, though constantly contested by the Byzantines and the Venetians.

With our influence growing in the region, we can once more assert our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
king_of_rama_title;King of Rama;;;;;;;;;;;;;
king_of_rama_desc;Hungary has always looked to the south for room to expand, and Bosnia is a tempting target. The medieval kings of Hungary sometimes held direct or indirect control over the region, and even adopted the title 'King of Rama', referring to a river in Bosnia's south.

king_of_galicia_desc;In the middle ages Hungary's control sometimes extended well into Ruthenia. King Andrew II ruled the region centered on the cities of Galych and Volodymyr, and added to his title the style, 'King of Galicia and Lodomeria'. Indeed, it is through Hungary's claims on Galicia that the Austrian emperors justified their annexation of the region in the First Partition of Poland.

hypodermic_injection_desc;In the 1840s physicians interested in safe ways to administer small amounts of potent medications such as opiates and strychnine experimented with injection through the skin using hollow needles. Doctors found that an injection beneath the skin anywhere on a patient's body could produce effects elsewhere, as the blood carried the medication throughout the body.

aspirin_desc;Since antiquity people have used preparations of willow bark and other salicylate-rich plants to reduce pain and inflammation. In the 1800s chemists began exploring related compounds in the hope of finding one with similar medicinal properties but fewer side effects.

EVTNAME16005;The First Shot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16005;After seceding from the Union, state governments in the South seized all federal property within their territories, including courthouses, mints, and military fortifications. At first loyalist soldiers in the seceded territories were ordered to offer no resistance, but the two sides chose to test each other's determination at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. The Union garrison refused to leave peacefully, and in the end the Confederate army bombarded the island until the greatly outnumbered garrison was forced to surrender the facility. Hearing that Southerners had fired upon Union troops, the government in the North declared the attack an act of war and began mobilizing its armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16350;The Trent Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16350;Two Confederate diplomats, hoping to establish good relations with $COUNTRY$, are aboard the HMS Trent. We have just received word, however, that the American warship San Jacinto has intercepted the Trent and taken the diplomats prisoner. This can be seen as an act of war on British territory, and many are calling for an American apology and reparations for this insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16351;The British vessel HMS Trent was transporting two Confederate diplomats to Britain and France, where they would attempt to involve them on the Confederate side in this war. The Trent was intercepted, however, by one of our warships, the USS San Jacinto, and the Confederate diplomats arrested. This has offended the British, who are demanding an apology from our officials and the immediate release of the diplomats. British forces have begun making isolated showings of force along the Canadian border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16352;Delegates from the United States have apologized and released the two Confederate envoys into British care. They made several demonstrations that they would not interfere with British shipping in any way in the future, and our own officials came back quite pleased with the meeting. Of course, at this point we certainly cannot join the Confederates, or offer them any support, in light of tense Anglo-American relations as a result of the Trent affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16353;The United States has begun to position troops along its border with our colony in Canada, making it clear that they will not back down. Official delegates from the United States government declare that what they did was only an act of war against the Confederates, but if British diplomats press the Trent issue, then the Union will consider Britain on the side of the Confederate secessionists, and react accordingly. It seems that there is no choice now but war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16354;A Unionist warship commandeered a British vessel, the HMS Trent, in order to arrest two of our diplomats who were crossing the Atlantic to petition European governments for support. There briefly seemed to be some hope of escalation into outright war between the Union and the British, but it seems Washington has backed down, and the British will remain neutral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16355;A Union warship commandeered a British vessel, the Trent, in order to arrest two of our diplomats who were crossing the Atlantic to petition European governments for support.

EVTNAME16600;The Obsolescence of Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16600;With the dawn of the twentieth century, slavery in developed countries is fading away in the face of modern industry. Only fifty years ago $COUNTRY$'s strength was been built on the backs of our slaves, but as tractors, automobiles, trains and other machines begin to replace mass labour we are faced with a choice. Will we cling to our agrarian slave system to the detriment of industrial development, or will we join the march of progress and free ourselves from the shackles of the slave economy? Just as two generations ago a great house was divided, so now $COUNTRY$ must become all one thing, or all the other: a nation of freedom and industry, or a nation of chains and agriculture. Which will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME16610;A Black Abolitionist;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16610;A free man of black ancestry has given a speech at a national university. Many were impressed by his eloquence and the clarity of his arguments against slavery, asking how it is that 'in a land of freedom, we celebrate the sight of a man in chains.' He could become a major force in the cause of abolitionism, and already pro-slavery politicians have demanded that his speeches be censored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16611;A Progressive Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16611;A number of respected industrialists have formed what they call a 'Progressive Society' aimed at bringing an end to slavery in $COUNTRY$. They argue that slavery, while natural in a plantation-based economic model, has no place in a nation attempting to industrialize and compete in the modern economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16612;Marxist Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16612;In the plantation fields, 'The Internationale' is beginning to be sung as loudly and frequently as the old slave spirituals. A number of literate slaves have begun spreading the socialist philosophies of Marx and Engels and the vision of a world without social classes.

EVTNAME16652;Standard Time Adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16652;In order to prevent confusion about the time of day between train stations along the length of our railroad networks, we will adopt a system of standardized timekeeping.

EVTDESC16653;Pioneered by performers like Scott Joplin and Ernest Hogan, ragtime is a genre of music that began among African-Americans in the South. Afterwards it became widely known and widely played on piano, and had a key role in popularizing new music recording methods and the later genre of jazz.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16654;The Blues;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16654;Blues music, like ragtime and jazz before it, was first played and composed by Afro-American musicians of the American South. While jazz enjoyed popularity among blacks and whites in the 1920s and 1930s, blues was mostly relegated to black listeners until after the Second World War. It was arguably formed as a musical genre in 1912 with the publishing of Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues," but has its roots in traditional slave songs of the 19th century. Most famously, blues later became the bedrock for the most popular musical sensation of them all: rock n' roll.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16655;Mardi Gras;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16655;New Orleans has long been known for the festival of Mardi Gras, a Christian cultural celebration taking place prior to the Lent season, brought to the area by French Catholic colonists. Generally Mardi Gras is just a single day of feasting, but in New Orleans the colourful and energetic Mardi Gras celebrations can last for several days or more. Mardi Gras was recognized by Louisiana as an official state holiday in 1875.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16656;An American Centennial;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16656;One hundred years ago, the Thirteen Colonies organized and began their rebellion against Britain, forming the United States of America on the 4th of July, 1776. We have seen this nation through good times and bad, but by God, we will never let America fall. From now until the end of time, the United States will be a shining name in the pages of history, a beacon of freedom and democracy in the world. Today of all days, we truly should be proud to be Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16658;National Parks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16658;In order to conserve the raw beauty of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ wilderness, a government agency has been created to oversee and manage designated regions of exceptional splendor. This National Park Service will prevent the natural environment from being unnecessarily despoiled and will preserve the true beauty of the wilderness--- for $COUNTRY$, her people, and the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16660;Mississippi Flooding;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16660;Along the Missouri River and the Upper Mississippi, heavy rainfall and inadequate preparation have led to major floods, the worst in decades. With the increasing population of $COUNTRY$ especially in the areas around the Mississippi and its tributaries, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a set of levees and ditches to prevent high water from wiping out whole towns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16661;Recalling last decade's horrendous floods along the Upper Mississippi, there has been another year of extraordinary rain and subsequent floods along the very same Mississippi River. We had made sure riverside towns were prepared for any threat of flooding, but this time the floods hit mostly rural areas and new colonial towns, which hadn't yet managed to establish systems of levees to cope with rising water levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16662;The worst floods yet have hit many of our cities along the Mississippi and its tributaries, overwhelming even our painstakingly built levees and ditches. We begin to wonder whether modern technology can truly protect us from nature's fury. Perhaps we can only pray that a disaster of this scale never again strikes our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME22240;An Austro-Polish Alliance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC22240;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is now a rising power in central Europe, and $COUNTRY$ has lost the Polish lands it once ruled. Rather than begrudge that loss forever, we could accept the new reality and make the best of our new strategic situation. By resolving our few remaining overlapping claims, we could lay the foundation for a strong new alliance between ourselves and $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, such an alliance could prove crucial in both nations' conflicts with our mutual neighbors and rivals, Russia and Prussia. Shall we begin a new chapter in Austro-Polish relations, or keep our sights fixed on the past?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31110;Our Crimean Vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31110;The Crimean Khanate has been liberated from Russian control, and the Giray Khan is reinstated. Crimea is once again an Ottoman vassal, and a bulwark against Russian aggression from the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31111;Defeat in Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31111;We were unable to restore the Crimean Khanate's independence, and now the international community will laugh our claims away. It seems that we will have to share the Black Sea, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31200;The Fate of Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31200;With the Ottomans defeated and the Balkans at peace, the Powers must now decide the fate of the new Greek state: what should its status be with respect to the Ottoman Empire, and where should its borders be drawn? Representatives of the Great Powers have suggested that a conference might be held in $CAPITAL$ where diplomats could discuss the future of Greece and determine the best way to preserve Europe's balance of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31204;After weeks of negotiations, the conference of diplomats in $CAPITAL$ has reached a conclusion: Greece must be made strong.\n\nThe Powers agree that a Greek state should be established with enough territory and population to defend its independence. It will rule southern and central Greece and some Aegean islands. The Empire's other predominantly Greek territories will remain under direct Ottoman rule. The conference's other participants now await the response from the Ottoman delegate, who must surely be disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31205;The Treaty of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31205;After weeks of negotiations, a conference of diplomats in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital has reached a conclusion: Greece must remain under Ottoman suzerainty. A treaty formalizing the result is being signed in the Ottoman capital.\n\nThe Powers agree that Greece must bow to Ottoman rule. The most rebellious regions in southern Greece will be given an autonomous government, along the same lines as the Romanian principalities along the Danube. The Empire's other predominantly Greek territories will remain under direct Ottoman rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31206;After weeks of negotiations, a conference of diplomats in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital has reached a conclusion: Greece must have its independence. A treaty formalizing the result is being signed in the Ottoman capital.\n\nThe Powers agree that a sovereign Greek state should be established. It will rule southern Greece and some western Aegean islands, but its territory will be kept small. The Empire's other predominantly Greek territories will remain under direct Ottoman rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31211;Greece Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31211;Greece has defied the convention and refused to ratify the general treaty acknowledging the Ottoman Empire's suzerainty. They insist that they will have full independence, with or without the support of the Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31212;Greece has defied the convention and refused to ratify the general treaty acknowledging the new borders. They insist that they will retain control of all the territory they held when the war ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31213;Ottoman Empire Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31213;The Ottoman Empire has defied the convention and refused to ratify the general treaty acknowledging the new borders. They insist that they will retake central Greece, with or without the support of the other Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31230;An Anatolian Treaty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31230;The Greek government has brought us an interesting proposal. Rather than insist upon unification with all Greek-speaking peoples in the region, their government now offers to officially renounce its claims to any contested territories in Anatolia. In exchange, they would expect our government to acknowledge exclusive Greek sovereignty in their Balkan homelands. This would begin a new chapter in Greco-Turkish relations, one in which we wouldn't face the continual prospect of war with each other. Will there be peace in our time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31240;Imperial Pretensions Challenged;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31240;Our waning global influence is leading many to question our claims to the legacy of the Roman Empire. Foreign newspapers are once again referring to the nation as "Greece," and foreign diplomats are coughing into their sleeves when our envoys describe themselves as "Romans." We should consider backing down from our imperial claims while it can still be done with dignity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31250;Balkan Rebellions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31250;Ali Pasha, our governor in Epirus, has repudiated the authority of the central government and raised his fief in revolt. Even as our forces move to punish his impertinence, Greek nationalists are rising up in the Peloponnese to proclaim their independence from the Empire. The Greek rebellion is spreading into central Greece and southern Macedonia, and the islands of Crete and Cyprus threaten to escape our control completely. The Empire must call up its armies and crush these rebellions, before any other regional governors or nationalities are tempted to follow their example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31251;Chaos in the Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31251;Greek nationalists in Crete and Cyprus are funding and supplying the rebellion on the mainland, and some rebels have even sailed to Macedonia to join the fighting. Now we have completely lost control of one of our island pashaliks, and an unsavory dilemma faces us.\n\nIf we do nothing, the mainland rebellion will be strengthened. However, The Wali of Egypt, our ambitious vassal, could likely be convinced to restore order in the islands... if he were then made governor of the territory in question. Egyptian intervention would eliminate one source of rebel support and discourage the insurgents, but it would also strengthen a vassal whose loyalty is already suspect. Should we invite Egypt into the islands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31252;A Request from the Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31252;The Greek rebellion has taken over the island of Crete. Now the Sultan asks Egypt to intervene and restore order in the island... and promises to allow us to keep control of any lands we seize from the rebels. We might prefer to see the rebellion continue to weaken our overlord, but this is an excellent opportunity to gain a key naval base without drawing the ire of the international order. What should our response be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31254;Egypt Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31254;Egypt has greed to intervene and put down the rebellion in the islands. This will cut a source of materiel and fighters for the Greeks and should shorten the rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31255;Egypt Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31255;Egypt has declined our offer and disavowed its responsibilities as a vassal of the Empire. The rebellion will be heartened by this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31256;Continuing Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31256;The Greek rebellion is suppressed, for the moment. Ottoman rule is restored in southern Greece, but in the Peloponnese and the islands the surviving separatist leaders scheme on. This isn't over yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31257;Greek Rebellion Continues;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31257;Despite fierce fighting and purges of Greek leadership in reconquered regions, the Peloponnesian Greeks still will not accept Ottoman Rule. The rebels are gaining confidence and have begun to organize a provisional Greek government. Unfortunately, this gives their revolt an air of legitimacy, and they are beginning to attract sympathy from the Christian powers of Europe. We must end this uprising, and quickly-- or we may find other nations looking to take advantage of our vulnerability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31258;The Rebellion Grows;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31258;We have held our ground against the Turks, and ever more of our brothers under Ottoman oppression rise up to support the revolution. We will begin organizing a provisional government so that we can petition the Christian powers of Europe for recognition as a legitimate state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31259;The Egyptian Dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31259;The Wali of Egypt is an ambitious reformer with designs on our lands. He has long coveted Syria, and this Greek war exposes us to his treasonous expansionism. This danger also presents an opportunity: perhaps we can buy his support against the Greeks by promising to increase his territory when the war is over. Of course, we needn't keep our promise-- and if we don't make some sort of offer, Egypt is likely to attack us while we are distracted by the Greeks.\n\nShould we call on Egypt to support us in exchange for future territory in the Levant, or should we prepare to put our vassal in his place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31260;Greek Rebellion in the Ottoman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31260;Despite fierce fighting and purges of Greek leadership in reconquered regions, the Peloponnesian Greeks still will not accept Ottoman Rule. The ongoing rebellion means that the Empire is weakened and distracted-- and vulnerable. This could be the perfect opportunity for Egypt to expand into the Levant and begin to eclipse its onetime overlord. Such a chance may not come again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31261;A Proposal from the Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31261;Despite fierce fighting and purges of Greek leadership in reconquered regions, the Peloponnesian Greeks still will not accept Ottoman Rule. Knowing that we wish to expand our lands to the north, the Sultan now sends a proposal: if Egypt will assist the Empire in pacifying Greece, lands in the Levant will be transferred to Egyptian governance.\n\nThis rebellion makes the Empire vulnerable, and we could simply seize Levantine lands by force, though we would be seen to betray our titular suzerain. Or, by accepting the Sultan's proposal we stand to eventually gain the lands by entirely legitimate means... if the Empire keeps its promise. Which is the best course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31262;Egypt Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31262;Egypt has honored our call to arms and will join our war against the rebellious Greeks. This should shorten the rebellion... though we have now committed to give Egypt lands in the Levant when the war is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31263;Egypt Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31263;Egypt has rebuffed our call to arms and dishonored its obligation as our vassal. It seems clear now that the Egyptian governor intends to invade the Levant. We must ready our defenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31264;The Greek Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31264;Sympathy for the cause of Greek independence is growing in many European societies. Now the Greeks have organized a provisional government in the Peloponnese and are seeking recognition and aid from European powers. Greek independence would weaken the Ottoman Empire and strengthen Russia, as well as likely encouraging nationalist revolts elsewhere. What should our government's policy on this matter be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31265;Sympathy for the cause of Greek independence is growing in many European societies. Now the Greeks have organized a provisional government in the Peloponnese and are seeking recognition and aid from European powers. Greek independence would weaken the Ottoman Empire and strengthen Russia's position in the Mediterranean. Better still, the Greek conflict provides an excellent pretext for war with the Turks, by which we could further advance our influence around the Black Sea. Shall we seize this moment and attack the Turks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31266;Egyptian Retaliation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31266;Egypt is a vassal of the Ottoman Sultan, and before our intervention Egypt explicitly committed to support the Empire in its pacification of Greece. So, going to war with the Ottomans means that we are now also at war with Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31267;Greece Reconquered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31267;The Greek rebellion has been thoroughly crushed, its leaders killed or scattered, its spirit broken. An example has been made of the Peloponnesians, and the other nationalities of the Empire will think twice before seeking independence. The Empire's rule is absolute!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31268;An Internal Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31268;Greek nationalists are seeking foreign attention in $PROVINCENAME$, but so far we have been able to persuade the other Great Powers that the Greek rebellion is a purely domestic matter, in which it would be improper for them to involve themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31269;Peace with Egypt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31269;Now that our war with the Ottoman Empire is finished, there is no more reason for us to fight with Egypt... unless we aim for more than we claimed when we intervened. We could fight on for concessions from Egypt, but the rest of the world would resent our naked opportunism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31270;Muhammad Ali's Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31270;Egypt agreed to support the Ottoman Empire in its war against the Greek separatists because we were promised lands in Palestine and Syria. Now years have passed, and the Sultan still has not honored that promise. It is time for an ultimatum to the Sultan: either Egypt will remain part of the Empire in return for lands in the Levant, or else war will follow. The only question is how aggressive our demands should be.\n\nIf we only demand the southern regions of Palestine and Transjordan, the Sultan is more likely to agree. But, we were promised all of the Levant and have every right to demand the entirety. Which shall it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31271;Egypt's Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31271;We persuaded Egypt to aid us against the Greeks with the promise of Levantine territories, but we have not yet delivered. The Egyptian governor has grown impatient and now demands at least the southern regions of Palestine and Transjordan. In exchange, Egypt will formally submit to Ottoman suzerainty. The alternative, his message implies, is war for the Levant. Shall we concede some territory in exchange for peace and stability, or shall we defy Egypt to make good on its threats?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31272;We persuaded Egypt to aid us against the Greeks with the promise of Levantine territories, but we have not yet delivered. The Egyptian governor has grown impatient and now demands all of our lands from Palestine to Syria. In exchange, Egypt will formally submit to Ottoman suzerainty. The alternative, his message implies, is war for the Levant. Shall we concede a large territory in exchange for peace and stability, or shall we defy Egypt to make good on its threats?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31273;The Sultan Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31273;The Sultan will honor his promise and concede the Levantine territories we demanded. In return, Egypt will reacknowledge Ottoman suzerainty and remain a part of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31274;The Sultan Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31274;The Sultan has refused to honor his promise and concede the Levantine territories we demanded. Now we must decide if we are truly ready to make war on the Empire for our rights. Is the Levant worth a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31275;An Egyptian Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31275;Egypt's invasion of the Levant provides us with a singular opportunity. The Empire has been weakened in recent years by rebellion and secession, and this attack by the Empire's strongest vassal means that our Kurdish territories might be able to break free as well. After centuries of Turkish domination, Kurdistan could once again control its own fate. Another chance such as this may never come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31276;Kurdish Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31276;Taking advantage of the chaos caused by Egypt's invasion, the Kurdish emirs in the east have risen up to proclaim their independence from the Empire. This is an unwelcome distraction with Egyptian armies already pouring into Palestine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31277;Intervention in the Orient?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31277;The governor of Egypt is waging war against his nominal sovereign, the Ottoman sultan. The conflict doesn't directly concern us, but perhaps we could advance our strategic interests through intervention.\n\nWe could offer Egypt our support, perhaps hoping to indebt a rising regional power. Or, we could take the Empire's side and try to force a settlement for the sake of stability. We could also ignore the matter entirely, though we might look a bit weak. What should our policy be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31278;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31278;The ambassador from $FROMCOUNTRY$ informs us that his government is moved to support our claims in the Levant. We can expect their diplomatic and military aid in advancing our cause. This significantly improves our prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31279;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31279;The ambassador from $FROMCOUNTRY$ informs us that his government is alarmed by our invasion of the Levant and warns us to make peace immediately. He says that the Sultan is amenable to a settlement that would see Egypt recognized as governor of Palestine, as long as Egypt accepts Ottoman suzerainty and swears to support the Empire in the future. We would gain some of the lands we had hoped for in the Levant but give up our independence. If we choose to fight for a more favorable arrangement, $FROMCOUNTRY$ means to intervene against us immediately. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31281;The Convention of Kutahya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31281;Egypt has accepted a settlement negotiated by the Great Powers. The Ottoman Empire will transfer territories in the Levant to Egyptian control, and in return Egypt will acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty and swear loyalty to the sultan. Peace has been restored in the Orient, and the stability of the Ottoman state preserved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31282;Ultimatum Ignored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31282;Egypt has turned down our offer to negotiate a settlement and is continuing its invasion of the Ottoman Empire. For the sake of stability in the east, we are now compelled to intervene on the Empire's side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31284;Ambitions Thwarted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31284;Egypt is beaten. We have been forced to make peace without the gains we had hoped for in the Levant, and our prospects for future expansion are greatly dimmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31285;Treaty of Kutahya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31285;Egypt has forced the Ottoman Empire into a humiliating peace. The sultan has acknowledged Egypt's independence and hereditary rule, not only in Egypt but in the Levant. Ottoman territories in the Hedjaz and Cyrenaica have also been transferred to Egyptian control. Egypt's power waxes ever greater, and the Empire appears close to collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31295;Succession Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31295;In 1832 the old Pasha of Tripoli abdicated, and his three sons each laid claim to his throne. Factions in the government and military support each, and civil conflict seemed likely. Worse, with the decline Tripolitania had suffered generally since piracy in the Mediterranean became difficult and the trans-Saharan slave trade dried up, the nation looked especially vulnerable to outside powers. The Ottomans seized the moment as an opportunity to reassert direct Imperial rule in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31296;Intervention in Tripolitania?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31296;Tripolitania is a nominal vassal of ours, but in reality the local Pashas have long been effectively independent. Their state has been in steep decline in recent decades, however, and now they are descending into a succession crisis that will likely shatter the nation. This provides both the opportunity and the excuse for us to intervene and reassert direct Imperial rule in Tripoli, for the stability of the region. Shall we call up the armies to install a loyal governor in Tripoli?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31525;The German Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31525;The Vienna Congress established a "German Confederation" to take the place of the Holy Roman Empire. It was meant to serve as a diplomatic forum and customs union, but the rivalry between $COUNTRY$ and Prussia has threatened to shatter German unity.\nThe time has come to put Prussia in its place and re-establish $COUNTRY$ as the preeminent German power. Let us break Prussia's strength, once and for all, and remind the lesser German states that it is we who lead the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32560;The Caucasus War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32560;In 1828 several Muslim imams in Dagestan and Chechnya called for a holy war against Russia, which had ruled the region since taking it from Persia in the Treaty of Gulistan. Proclaiming an independent Imamate of the Caucasus, they and their followers waged a guerilla separatist war against Russia throughout most of the nineteenth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32561;The Call to Holy War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32561;Several imams in Dagestan and Chechnya have given the call for Gazawat, holy war against the infidel Russians who claim to rule these lands. Our people are swept up in the fervor of jihad! Let us join the Imamate of the Caucasus and fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32562;The Call to Holy War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32562;The imams have spoken: the infidel rule of the Russians must be thrown off and proper Islamic government re-established. The various Muslim territories of the Caucasus are united under the banner of our imamate. May Allah smile upon our struggle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32565;Caucasian Separatism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32565;Despite their defeat on the battlefield, the Muslims of the Caucasus refuse to accept the inevitability of Russian rule. Unrest simmers in the mountains, waiting for a charismatic imam to call for another holy war. It seems clear that this conflict will carry on for some time to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME35310;Revolutions in Lombardy-Venetia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC35310;The liberal convulsions racking the empire have mingled with long-suppressed Italian nationalism in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia with terrible effect. A riot-turned-rebellion in Milan has driven the imperial garrison out of the city, and Venice, too, has risen up in revolt. Rebels are proclaiming republics in Lombardia and Venetia, and both are seeking support and protection from Piedmont. Unless these revolts are suppressed, Austria faces the total loss of its Italian territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME35705;Election of Pius IX;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC35705;The papal conclave of 1846 took an unexpected turn, as liberals and moderates among the cardinals combined to elect Bishop Mastai-Ferretti of Spoleto, an Italian patriot and reformer. Conservative Catholic governments were shocked, including that of Austria, which had attempted to block his nomination. Taking the name Pius IX, he quickly instituted political and economic reforms in the Papal States and released political prisoners. For a time, the new pope was the most popular man on the Italian peninsula, where the exclamation 'Long life to Pius IX!' was often heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36226;Sell the Nicobars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36226;Denmark still holds a colonial outpost in the Indian Ocean: the Nicobar Islands. Voices in parliament have begun calling on the government to seek out a buyer for the archipelago, to eliminate the expense of administration and communication with the islands and show the government's focus on European and domestic affairs.\nIt would be something of a symbolic admission that Denmark is no longer a truly global power, but it would also strengthen the budget and appease the opposition. Shall we search for a buyer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36227;Purchase the Nicobars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36227;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us about purchasing their colony in the Nicobar Islands. The islands are relatively insignificant, but an extra territory never hurts. Shall we take them up on the offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36720;Belgian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36720;The United Kingdom of the Netherlands established at the Congress of Vienna was ruled from Protestant Holland, but the majority of its population were in Catholic Belgium. Over the decade after the Congress, tensions between the Belgians and the ruling Dutch intensified, until in 1829 a nationalist riot in Brussels led to the secession of the southern Netherlands. The Great Powers quickly called for a conference to resolve the conflict diplomatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36725;The Belgian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36725;Belgium's secession from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands poses a thorny problem for the Concert of Europe. A strong Netherlands was established at the Congress of Vienna as a curb on French expansionism, but it seems increasingly clear that the kingdom may not be able to hold itself together. Representatives of the Great Powers have suggested that a conference might be held in $CAPITAL$ where diplomats could discuss the future of the low countries and determine the best way to preserve Europe's balance of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36726;The Belgian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36726;Ministers from the various Great Powers are gathering for a conference in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital to discuss Belgium's recent secession from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Three potential solutions to the crisis present themselves.\n\nFirst, the breakaway Belgian provinces could be forcibly reincorporated into the united Netherlands, keeping the kingdom strong as a bulwark against France. Second, Belgium could be recognized as a sovereign kingdom in its own right, but guaranteed as a neutral buffer state between France and northern Europe. Third, the Belgian territories could be partitioned for their protection, with the German-speaking east being taken into Prussia, the French-speaking south added to France, and the Dutch-speaking northwest established as a Principality of Antwerp guaranteed by a neutral Power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36735;The Treaty of $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36735;After weeks of negotiations, the conference of diplomats in $CAPITAL$ has reached a conclusion: the Netherlands must be reunited.\n\nThe Powers agree that Dutch rule must be restored in Belgium. The German-speaking territories of the Duchy of Luxembourg will be given autonomy, to remove one source of conflict. Neutral armed forces are being readied to escort the Dutch governor back into the troubled territory. The conference's other participants now await the response from the Belgian delegate, who must surely be disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36736;After weeks of negotiations, the conference of diplomats in $CAPITAL$ has reached a conclusion: Belgium's independence must be recognized.\n\nThe Powers agree that the Belgians have won their freedom and now constitute a legitimate kingdom. All that remains is to settle its boundaries and select its new monarch. The conference's other participants now await the response from the Dutch delegate, who must surely be disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36737;After weeks of negotiations, the conference of diplomats in $CAPITAL$ has reached a conclusion: Belgium must be partitioned between its neighbors, for the protection of its inhabitants.\n\nThe Powers agree that the Belgian territories have shown themselves too fractious to be long kept under united rule. Instead, the French- and German-speaking regions will be taken under the protection of France and Prussia, respectively, while the Dutch-speaking west will constitute a new Principality of Antwerp. All that remains is to settle the boundaries of the partition. The conference's other participants now await the response from the Dutch delegate, who must surely be disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36738;The Belgian Question:\nReunification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36738;The Great Powers assembled at the conference have decided against us, and they now say they intend to see Dutch rule restored. If we submit to their decision, we will lose our hard-won independence again, perhaps forever. If we defy them, we face the prospect of almost immediate war with the Dutch and international isolation. What is the best course for our nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36739;The Belgian Question:\nBelgian Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36739;The Great Powers assembled at the conference have decided against us, and they now say they intend to recognize Belgium's independence and sovereignty. If we submit to their decision, we will lose half of our territory, most of our population and industry, and any realistic hope of remaining a major power. If we defy them, we will outrage the international order and undermine any alliances we hold. What is the best course for our nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36740;The Belgian Question:\nBelgium Partitioned?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36740;The Great Powers assembled at the conference have decided against us, and they now say they intend to partition the Belgian lands between them, restoring to us only a sliver. If we submit to their decision, we will lose half of our territory, most of our population and industry, and any realistic hope of remaining a major power. If we defy them, we will outrage the international order and undermine any alliances we hold. What is the best course for our nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36741;Belgium Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36741;Belgium has acceded to the decision of the conference and ratified the treaty. Order has been restored to the Low Countries and rightful monarchy upheld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36742;The Netherlands Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36742;The Netherlands has acceded to the decision of the conference and ratified the treaty. Peace has been restored to the Low Countries and the international order upheld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36744;Belgium Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36744;Belgium has defied the convention and unilaterally proclaimed its sovereignty. The Dutch will doubtless prepare an invasion to restore order to the territory, and it is likely that other Powers may assist them in punishing the Belgians' presumption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36745;The Netherlands Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36745;The Netherlands has defied the convention and refused to ratify the general treaty acknowledging Belgium's sovereignty. They insist that they will regain control of their southern provinces, with or without the support of the Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME36938_NEW;Publication of Durgeshnandini;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36938_NEW;Today the novel 'Durgeshnandini' was released in the book stores of Calcutta. The book, a love story set against the backdrop of Pathan-Mughal conflicts in West Bengal, is written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and is the first major novel in Bengali literature. While conservatives in Bengali society might be unimpressed with its lucidity, it accessibility is sure to be a draw to the people.\n\nBengali culture has been undergoing a sort of renaissance in recent decades. Starting with the works of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, an appreciation for the richness of India's past has grown together with an examination of the impact of the modern West upon it. As these elements blend together, reform movements are forming to eradicate native 'superstitions' (such as sati, caste-division, and untouchability).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36939_NEW;The people of India have long been held back by superstitions and barbarous practices, the Sati (widow-burning) being only the most egregious example. In an effort to lift the veil of ignorance and backwardness from the Indian peoples, Governor-General Lord Dalhousie has devised a program of reform for India. Under his guidance the farthest reaches of the subcontinent are to be connected by rail and telegraph, the postal service improved, canals financed and the civil service reformed. Dalhousie's reforms are but a few of the benefits the Empire offers to its Indian subjects! After all, who can put a price on civilization?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36946;Seeking Recognition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36946;As European interest in our islands grows, we should secure our nation's future by seeking the protection of a Great Power. The British and the French have both expressed interest in developing closer ties with our people. By offering trade concessions, we could likely secure legal recognition of our sovereignty and land rights. Should we tie our future to the British Empire, or the French?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36948;The Baptist War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36948;Troubling news comes from Jamaica. A native slave named Samuel Sharpe, also a respected Baptist preacher, organized a general strike among the island's slaves to call for emancipation and better working conditions. The strike quickly escalated into a riot and was suppressed by force, with hundreds of slaves killed and Sharpe himself hanged. Reports point to the widespread use of excessive force by the local garrison, and abolitionists in Britain are now adamant that an enquiry must be conducted. Should we investigate the incident, or sweep it under the rug?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36949;The Slavery Abolition Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36949;As expected, the findings of the enquiry into the so-called 'Baptist War' contain extensive criticism of the West Indies' plantocracies and the condition of the slaves. Their publication has bolstered criticism of human slavery in Parliament and renewed calls for its abolition across the Empire. Now, reform-minded MPs are ready to introduce an act to outlaw the practise of slavery, free all slaves within the British Empire, and compensate their previous owners. Does this bill have the government's support?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36952;Highlands Potato Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36952;The potato blight has spread into the Scottish highlands, and crops across the region are failing. Some local landlords are distributing oatmeal and hiring crofters for public works projects, but others are rounding up the indigent and shipping them off to Canada and Australia. Which policy should the government endorse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37234;The Fan Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37234;The French Republic contracted with the dey of Algeria to purchase large volumes of wheat to feed the revolutionary armies. Since the monarchy has been reinstated, however, the king has refused to pay the republic's debts. This has led to a progressive deterioration in relations between our two nations, and the dey recently punctuated a particularly heated meeting with a French minister by striking him in the face with a fan. The French crown has demanded an apology, which has not been given. Should we amend relations and pay our nation's debts, or should we use this slight as justification for a war against the Algerians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37242_NEWS;FRENCH CONSTITUTION SUSPENDED;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Vocal liberals have renounced their allegiance to the king. Once more revolution is in the air in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37242_NEWS_LONG;After demands from the French parliament that state ministers be elected by the body itself, King Charles has taken the extraordinary step of suspending the constitution and dissolving parliament, simultaneously censoring the press and altering the electoral system to ensure a more biddable legislature. French liberals are incensed, crying that the lawful government has been undone. Some have publicly renounced their allegiance to the king. Once more, revolution is in the air in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37244_NEWS;REVOLUTION IN FRANCE;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37244_NEWS_SHORT;As Paris erupts in riot and revolution, King Charles has fled to Versailles. Faced with total revolt, his only option may be to restore the constitution and abdicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37244_NEWS_MEDIUM;Revolutionary mobs have flooded the streets of Paris. As the city erupts in riot and revolution, King Charles has been forced to flee to Versailles, leaving the capital and the government in disarray. He may now be forced to restore the constitution and abdicate in order to restore public order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37244_NEWS_LONG;'Over the past three days Paris grew quieter as the milling crowds grew larger.' Enraged by the autocratic rule of the French king, revolutionary mobs have flooded the streets of Paris with cries of "Mort aux Ministres!" and "A bas les aristocrates!" Rebels have taken possession of such key sites as the Hotel d'Ville, the Louvre, the Tuileries and the Palais de Justice. King Charles has been forced to flee to Versailles, leaving the capital and the government in disarray. He may now be forced to restore the constitution and abdicate in order to restore public order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37760;The Carlist Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37760;In 1830 King Ferdinand VII of Spain was old and ailing, with no sons and only an infant daughter. Traditional succession law said that his brother, Infante Carlos, should succeed him as king, but Ferdinand promulgated a law establishing his daughter as his heir. Carlos felt robbed of his birthright, and his cause became a rallying point for traditionalists and legitimists throughout Spain. The nation's politics became increasingly polarised between the liberal supporters of Princess Isabel and the absolutist Carlists, who began making plans to put Carlos on the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37761;A Holy Appeal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37761;A liberal military insurrection in 1820 forced King Ferdinand VII to accept the Constitution of 1812, which reserves most governing power for the elected parliament. Now, after several years as a virtual prisoner of the parliament, the king has taken a desperate step. Invoking the agreements of the Vienna Congress, Ferdinand has called upon France to restore him to absolute rule, even it requires an invasion in force. The French, it is to be feared, will be only too happy to have an excuse to wage war upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37762;A Request for Aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37762;A liberal military insurrection in 1820 forced King Ferdinand VII of Spain to accept a liberal constitution, greatly limiting his powers. Now, after several years as a virtual prisoner of the parliament, the king has taken a desperate step. Invoking the agreements of the Vienna Congress, Ferdinand has called upon France to restore him to absolute rule, even it requires an invasion in force. It isn't every day that a neighbor's legitimate ruler invites us to invade...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37763;Ferdinand's Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37763;The French have overrun the country, and now they offer peace in exchange for King Ferdinand's restoration to absolute rule and the abolition of the Constitution of 1812. It seems a small price to pay, compared with what they might demand if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37800;El Libertador;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37800;Simon Bolivar, the liberator of Latin America, has led our great Colombian Federation to independence from the Spanish crown. Even now the fighting continues for the liberation of Ecuador and the Perus. Soon the last royalist forces will be defeated and the republics of South America will be free from tyranny. With such a great man leading our nation, who can doubt that Colombia has a bright future ahead of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37801;Admission to Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37801;Now that we have our independence, our Governor is interested in seeking admission to the Colombian Federation. The Colombians supported our independence from Spain, and our people would likely be far safer as part of such a large and strong state. But, some whisper that Bogota shows dictatorial tendencies, and that we might find that we had only traded one tyranny for another. What is the best course for our nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37802;North or South?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37802;Now that we have our independence, Panama should consider joining one of the federations we border. The Colombian Federation to our south appears stronger and more likely to defend our independence, but we have more in common culturally with the Federal Republic of Central America to our north. Which way does Panama's future lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37803;Federation with $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37803;Having won its independence, $FROMCOUNTRY$ is now petitioning us for admission to our federation. Our nation would be stronger with this addition, but perhaps the new territory would bring new conflict with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s neighbors. Shall we approve their accession to $COUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37805;Liberal Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37805;$COUNTRY$'s conservative constitution and strong central government are provoking discontent in the provinces. Liberals complain that the average $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen has few more political rights than under Spanish rule. Sectionalists agitate for federalization and greater regional autonomy. Should the government consider amending the constitution to appease the liberals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37806;Reactionary Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37806;$COUNTRY$'s liberal constitution and federal system of government are provoking discontent among the aristocracy. The landed elite complain that they are now governed by their social inferiors. The officer corps and the admirality grumble that the civilian political structure is too fractious and indecisive to lead the nation properly. Should the government consider amending the constitution to appease the traditionalists?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37807;A Secession Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37807;Regional conflicts have reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$. Dissatisfied with the centralist tendencies of the current government, elites and bureaucrats in $PROVINCENAME$ have come together to announce their intent to secede from $COUNTRY$ and establish a new state. This would be a grievous blow to our nation's power and prestige, and it faces us with a dilemma.\n\nIf we let this region secede peacefully, the other disaffected territories will want to follow suit. If, however, we attempt to hold the country together by force, we will lose our legitimacy outside of the core regions of New Granada. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37808;A Presidential Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37808;Regional conflicts have reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$. A cabal of elites and military leaders have come together in $PROVINCENAME$ to announce their intent to abolish the autonomy of the regions and proclaim the president Protector of Colombia for life. This would incense the estates in the east and west, and it faces us with a dilemma.\n\nIf the president becomes a dictator, the disaffected territories will certainly secede from the federation. We could attempt to hold the country together by force, but we would lose our legitimacy outside of the core regions of New Granada. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44130;The Maine Census;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44130;The Treaty of Paris (1783) ended the American Revolutionary War and established the new international border between the United States and British Canada. Some of the details, however, were vague or even contradictory, and now no one is quite certain where Maine ends and New Brunswick begins.\n\nThe state of Maine has sent census-takers into the disputed region and begun recording the local trappers and lumberjacks as American citizens, which has provoked the New Brunswick government into arrests and militia deployments. If the border isn't defined soon, the conflict seems set to grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44131;A Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44131;The border dispute along the Maine-New Brunswick frontier continues to escalate. There are now militias on both sides maneuvering along the rivers and ordering each other to stand down. The Secretary of State has invited the British Foreign Minister to work toward a general treaty settling this and a number of other minor disputes between our nations. But Congress is divided on the approach our envoy should take: should our priority be a peaceful resolution of the conflict, or should we insist upon the maximum territory even if it risks war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44132;The border dispute along the Maine-New Brunswick frontier continues to escalate. There are now militias on both sides maneuvering along the rivers and ordering each other to stand down. The American Secretary of State has invited our Foreign Minister to work toward a general treaty settling this and a number of other minor disputes between our nations. They appear to want the peace preserved, and are willing to renounce some of their claims if we will do the same. Shall we cooperate and keep the peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44133;The border dispute along the Maine-New Brunswick frontier continues to escalate. There are now militias on both sides maneuvering along the rivers and ordering each other to stand down. The American Secretary of State has invited our Foreign Minister to work toward a general treaty settling this and a number of other minor disputes between our nations. Unfortunately, they are taking an aggressive line, insisting upon their claims to the entire disputed region. Should we back down to keep the peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44134;Webster-Ashburton Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44134;We have concluded a treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, resolving several long-standing border disputes between our nations. In particular, the treaty has clearly established the border between Maine and the British colony of New Brunswick. Tensions along the border should be much reduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44135;Negotiations Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44135;The border negotiations have collapsed, and the British envoy has departed in a huff. Our relations will be greatly disrupted, and the border will have to be established the old-fashioned way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44136;A Border Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44136;Recently a series of rebellions aimed at achieving greater autonomy from Britain has rocked southern Canada, but Westminster has refused to offer any concessions to the Canadas. If we step in now and offer to "protect" the dissidents and republicans from the tyranny of Westminster, we can likely win their loyalty... and justify some northward adjustments to the international frontier. Certainly we would insist upon our full claims in northern Maine, and we could even "protect" the peninsula between the Great Lakes in southwestern Upper Canada, which has been a hotbed of rebellion against the colonial government. The Secretary of State will draw up a sternly worded ultimatum: how far should we extend our claims?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44137;Since their independence the United States have harbored some ideas of extending their control northward into the Canadas, and it seems that our harsh response to the recent rebellions there has driven the rebels into the Americans' arms. Now the American government says it intends to move the border northward, to "protect" the Canadian republicans from us, and the public appeals of the rebel leaders for American support gives their aggression an unfortunate veneer of legitimacy. If we back down it will weaken our already tenuous grasp on our remaining North American colonies, but to refuse is to risk war. What should our response be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44850;The First Mexican Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44850;After winning independence, Mexico's elites had intended to establish a constitutional monarchy with an emperor chosen from a European noble house. However, Spain refused to recognize the new nation as legitimate, and other crowned heads hesitated. In the mean time, the popular general who had been made President of the Regency, Agustín de Iturbide, built support for his own claim to the throne- in 1822 he was crowned Mexico's first emperor.\nAfter taking the throne, he quickly showed himself an absolutist, abolishing the elected parliament and suppressing all dissent. In the end his rule displeased both liberals, who had hoped for a constitutional monarchy or even a republic, and conservatives, who wanted a monarch from a proper European noble house rather than a military usurper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44851;The United Provinces of Central America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44851;The provinces of Guatemala in Central America united with Mexico shortly after their independence, but cultural and political differences between the two regions meant that Central America quickly chafed under Mexican rule. The Central American elites were deeply disappointed by Emperor Agustín's coronation, and they soon began talks in Guatemala City about seceding again to form their own republican federation. In 1823 a proclamation announced the establishment of the United Provinces of Central America, comprising all of New Spain's mainland territories southeast of the Yucatan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44854;Cherokee in Tejas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44854;Since the beginning of the century, many native groups, chiefly Cherokee, in the American South began to move westward due to American encroachment on their lands. Some settled just over the Mississippi River, but others went further west, across the Sabine River into Tejas. Before Mexico's independence, the Spanish authorities welcomed their prescence, hoping to use them as a buffer against American expansion. In late 1822, the Cherokee sent American diplomat Richard Fields to Mexico City to negotiate with the new government for the aquisition of land grants. With them, they hoped to gain official recognition of ownership of the lands they currently inhabit. Accepting this request could encourage further migrations into the area, allowing for the land to develop and also safeguard the border. On the other hand, the numbers aren't high enough to see benefits short-term. Perhaps it may be wise to also look elsewhere for more settler prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44855;Empresarios in Tejas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44855;In 1820 Spain signed a contract with an American named Moses Austin authorizing him to bring several hundred families from America to settle and defend New Spain's northern frontier, the territory of Tejas. The man then died, and Mexico soon won its independence, but Austin's son, Stephen, took up the contract in his father's stead, and the new Mexican government recognized the agreement. In the early 1820s thousands of settlers, mostly American, were enticed to the Tejas territory by land grants and minimal government oversight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44857;Cherokee Migration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44857;As American settlers move west across the Mississippi River, concern has risen for the local native populations that moved in before them that history may repeat itself. Looking at their brothers across the border, many are inspired to follow their footsteps, hoping they may have better fortunes there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44860;Claiming New Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44860;The mountainous lands to the north are part of the Spanish claims that Mexico has inherited. We must establish control of them, before our neighbors do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44861;Cuban Liberation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44861;Cuba without Mexico is aimed at imperialist yoke, Mexico without Cuba is a prisoner of the Gulf of Mexico.\nSince our independence, Havana has become Spain's last stronghold in North America. Our Foreign Minister contends that as long as Cuba remains in Spanish hands, Mexico will not be truly secure. He heads a growing movement to declare new war on our former masters and wrest Cuba from the Spanish crown. We worry, though, that the Americans also have designs on Cuba and might not look favorably upon our conquest of the island. If we are to pursue war with Spain, we should seek America's support first. If not, we could instead focus our efforts on normalizing relations with Spain and thus remove the threat of reconquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44862;Mexican Cuba?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44862;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ seeks America's support for an effort by his government to seize control of Cuba from Spain. While we are flattered that they felt the need to ask our permission, we hesitate to give it, since many in America are interested in eventually adding Cuba to our own Union. A Mexican Cuba would likely be a greater obstacle to that goal than a Spanish Cuba. Still, we also desire strong relations with our neighbor to the south. Shall we promise not to interfere with their attempt for Cuba, or should we discourage them from trying?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44863;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44863;$FROMCOUNTRY$ acknowledges our legitimate interests in Cuba and will not interfere. The time is right for Mexico to secure its independence once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44864;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44864;$FROMCOUNTRY$ refuses to sanction our invasion of Cuba, and warns that the attempt would disrupt our relations with them. How should we weigh the good will of the Yankees against all of our strategic interests in Cuba?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44865;Victory in Cuba!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44865;We have successfully wrested Cuba away from the Spanish crown, securing Mexico's territorial waters and liberating more of New Spain. Let the world recognize that Cuba is a part of Mexico, and always shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46315;The Portuguese Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46315;Emperor Pedro's brother has seized the throne of Portugal and abolished its constitution, displacing Pedro's daughter, Maria da Gloria, in the succession. The emperor now means to leave Brazil to mount an expedition aimed at restoring Queen Maria and the parliament. Before he goes, he will abdicate the throne of Brazil in favor of his son, Dom Pedro II, who is still a child. Until the child emperor comes of age, the country will be governed by parliamentary officials and a court of regents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46316;Dom Pedro II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46316;After much debate, it has been decided that Pedro II, though still short of the age of majority, will reign without a regency. He has proven to be a very capable young man, though quite shy, and he is much beloved by the people. The regency will be terminated immediately, and Dom Pedro II will officially begin his rule as Emperor of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46325;The War of the Farrapos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46325;After independence, the gauchos of the Brazilian Pampas felt excluded from the nation's political process and resented economic policies that harmed the south. In 1835 these tensions erupted in a separatist rebellion, which proclaimed a Republic of the Rio Grande.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46330;The Religious Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46330;There are a growing number of Freemasons within Brazilian churches, which is officially prohibited in Catholicism--- they exist most commonly within Lay Fraternities, which are generally charitable organizations chiefly associated with local churches. Historically, however, the church in Brazil has been de facto an apparatus of the state, making religious issues in Brazil matters of the crown, as well as the cloth. Local bishops have been calling for Freemason clergymen to resign, and now a bishop named Dom Vital has issued an interdict against certain Lay Fraternities that have refused to expel their Freemason brothers, preventing any sacraments from being celebrated within these Fraternity buildings. The lay brothers say this constitutes a direct challenge to Brazil's government, considering that notable members of Parliament are Freemasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46331;Dom Vital has refused to annul his controversial interdict, and has been joined in protest by the bishop Antonio de Macedo Costa, who has recently passed a similar interdict against uncooperative Lay Fraternities. This refusal could be used as a reason to arrest and imprison the bishops, hopefully preventing them from causing more trouble in the future, and to remove them as challenges to the authority of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46332;Vidal and Costa have been imprisoned for acting against the sovereign power of the Brazilian state, causing shock and anger amongst the Catholic populace in the country. The new Prime Minister, a Freemason and a Catholic himself, has threatened to resign if an imperial amnesty is not granted to Costa and Vidal. We must choose between unappealing alternatives.\n\nWe can either back down and free the bishops, appeasing our people but making the crown look weak and indecisive, or we can stand by the bishops' sentences and accept the dissolution of the current government and the outrage of the common folk. Which shall it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46410;The Thirty-Three Easterners;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46410;As recently as the 1810s the territory east of the Rio de la Plata was part of our United Provinces, but the Luso-Brazilian monarchy conquered the province in 1820. Now Platinean partisans have organized a rebellion, led by a group of patriots who call themselves the Thirty-Three Easterners. They intend to declare independence and rejoin our Union, and they have asked for our support as they resist Brazil's oppression. This is a fine opportunity to liberate some of our rightful territory... if we can win a war against Brazil. Will we fight for the Eastern Province?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46411;Rebellion in Cisplatina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46411;Our recently acquired territory on the near shore of the Rio de la Plata is restive. We've already conceded some regional autonomy, but now a group of Platinean partisans have declared their intention to secede and join the United Provinces to the southwest. Of course, we cannot allow this sort of separatism--- but it seems that the United Provinces intend to fight us for control of Cisplatina. Victory would cement our control over the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME46413;Victory in Cisplatina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46413;The Cisplatine rebellion is crushed, and the government in Buenos Aires has been compelled to acknowledge our sovereignty as far as the Rio de la Plata. This is a proud day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46414;Victory in the Eastern Province;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46414;The patriots in the Eastern Province have won their independence, and the Brazilian government has been compelled to acknowledge their accession to the United Provinces. This is a proud day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46415;Cisplatine Intervention?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46415;The Brazilian province of Cisplatina is in rebellion, hoping to transfer its allegiance to the United Provinces and Buenos Aires. The fighting has dragged on and is beginning to seriously disrupt our trade on the River Plate. Control of the river is the key to trade throughout southern South America, and we would prefer that Montevideo not be in the hands of any strong nation.\n\nOur diplomatic corps has a cunning plan: we can offer to mediate between Brazil and the United Provinces, hinting at retaliation if either side refuses. If we can make peace, we will proclaim the contested territory to be a new, independent state--- guaranteed by us, of course. Shall we make our move?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46416;British Mediation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46416;Our war in Cisplatina is disrupting trade on the Rio de la Plata, and the United Kingdom now informs us that it wishes to make peace between us and the United Provinces--- if only to restore free navigation. The British envoy assures us that they intend to keep Montevideo from Buenos Aires' control and guarantee our access to the river. He also hints that Britain's displeasure could only make things more difficult for us, should we refuse. If we aren't certain we can win the war, accepting their mediation is still a fairly good option. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46417;Brazil Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46417;Brazil has committed to accept the results of our mediation. Next we must persuade the United Provinces to participate in our negotiations. We will remind them that war is expensive... and that Brazil isn't the only nation they could find themselves at war with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46418;Brazil Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46418;Brazil has refused to accept our mediation! Considering that the territory at question was originally theirs, if they don't agree to our involvement then there is no reason why the United Provinces would. We will have to accept the results that the belligerents work out between themselves... and consider punishing Brazil's impertinence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46419;Our war in the Eastern Province is disrupting trade on the Rio de la Plata, and the United Kingdom now informs us that it wishes to make peace between us and Brazil--- if only to restore free navigation. The war is dragging on, and we can't keep this up indefinitely.\n\nThe British envoy proposes to establish the province as a new, independent state, thus at least keeping Montevideo from Brazil's control. It isn't the outcome we were hoping for, but the envoy implies that we could face retaliation from the United Kingdom if we don't comply. Do we dare defy the British?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46420;Treaty of Montevideo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46420;The United Kingdom has negotiated peace on the Rio de la Plata. Both parties to the conflict have agreed to recognize a new, independent state of Uruguay on the eastern shore of the river. All parties have committed to defend universal free navigation on the river, and the British will guarantee the independence of the new state. British commercial interests in South America are greatly advanced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46421;Buenos Aires Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46421;The United Provinces have refused to accept our mediation! This leaves no legitimate grounds for our involvement in their current conflict, but we can find reasons for a punitive war, should we wish it--- accusing their warships of piracy in the River Plate's estuary, perhaps. They will regret their short-sightedness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46450;The Walloon Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46450;A group of intellectuals and writers in Wallonia have been circulating ideas about Francophone nationalism in the south, complaining about the supposed marginalization of their people in the Netherlands. Now the activism has entered a new stage, and a political movement is forming to demand greater rights for French-speaking southerners, or even independence. Though small now, this movement could grow into a serious problem for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46451;Wallingants in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46451;Wallonian separatism has taken root in $PROVINCENAME$. This brings the Walloon Movement to ever greater national prominence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46452;Wallingant Riot in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46452;A march by Wallonian separatists in $PROVINCENAME$ has turned into a riot, and the city is shaken. Everyday citizens are horrified by the violence, and the Wallonian community is outraged at what they call police brutality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46453;Wallonian Autonomy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46453;A possible solution to the ongoing Wallonian unrest has presented itself. A bill has been brought before parliament that would devolve most domestic powers to a Wallonian regional government. Wallonia would become largely autonomous, with the central government managing only its foreign policy. This would substantially diminish our nation, both geographically and economically, but it would lay this separatist movement to rest for good. Will the government enact this legislation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46616;Tensions in the Falklands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46616;The Falkland Islands of the south Atlantic were a British naval staging ground in the days of the American Revolution, but Britain hasn't actively occupied the islands in decades. Spain claimed them around the turn of the century, but soon enough their entire viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata rebelled and broke free. Now the successor government in Buenos Aires is trying to revive the Spanish claim, and has begun actively settling the islands. We might not care, except that the Argentines have begun trying to restrain and tax seal hunting and whaling off the islands, and some of our merchants have been arrested. We could send a few warships to reclaim the islands, or we could accept the loss and move on. Which shall it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46617;Tensions in the Malvinas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46617;The governor we assigned to manage the settlement of the Malvinas has provoked an international conflict by trying to arrest the foreign crew of a ship caught poaching seals in the islands. British warships have now arrived in Port Luis and expelled our government. The British envoy says that this is not an act of war, but it certainly feels like one. He says that the Islands were British territories some fifty years ago, and the British are merely restoring their rule. We can insist that this constitutes an invasion and fight to take the islands back, or we can accept the loss while registering diplomatic protest. What is our response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46618;Argentine Resistance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46618;Buenos Aires refuses to give up the islands, and insists that we have committed an act of war by seizing them. To back down now would be impossible, so we find ourselves at war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46619;Argentine Acquiescence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46619;Buenos Aires agrees to relinquish control of the islands, though resentfully. Our naval base by the Horn is recovered, and without a shot fired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46630;Claiming South Georgia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46630;Our control of the Malvinas gives us a natural claim on their neighbors, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. We should dispatch an expedition to at least plant the flag and assert our sovereignty, before someone else beats us to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME900271;Greece Demands Epirus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC900271;The government of Greece sent a demand that the state of Epirus be returned to their rightful control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90039;The End of the Sepoy Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90039;The bloody uprising of the Sepoys has been brought to an end by the force of arms, and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control has been re-established in India. With the rebel strongholds retaken and the last pockets of resistance cleaned up, peace and stability should gradually return to the subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90039_NEWS_SHORT;The bloody uprising of the Sepoys has been brought to an end, and peace and stability should gradually return to India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME90059;Schleswig-Holstein Annexed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90095;Egypt Reduced;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90095;Despite our recent defeat, the Sultan has decided to confirm Egypt's autonomous government. However, all the territories we had acquired outside of Egypt and Sudan are to be returned to direct Imperial administration--- including, prominently, the Hedjaz and its Holy Cities. Egypt is once again merely one Ottoman vassal among many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90145;No More Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90145;With the loss of our colonies in Cuba and Puerto Rico, there are essentially no slaves left within our empire. At this point outlawing slavery would be largely an academic technicality, but we may as well draw up a proclamation and appease our liberal reformers in a relatively painless way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95029;The Establishment of Liberia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95029;In the early 1820s a number of American "colonization societies" established outposts on the Pepper Coast of Africa, to which they encouraged freed American slaves to remove themselves. In 1822 several of these colonies united and proclaimed the foundation of the new nation of Liberia, intended as a bastion of liberty on the dark continent and a perpetual home for African-Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95070;The November Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95070;In the 1820s the Russian Tsar undermined the Polish constitution that had been established at the Congress of Vienna, taking steps toward integrating Poland fully into Russia. The dissolution of their democratic system led to unrest among the Polish and Lithuanian peoples of the Russian West, and an open rebellion broke out in Warsaw in November 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95071;The Russian Tsar has progressively violated our constitution and intends to integrate Poland fully into Russia. Tonight a group of patriotic officers in Warsaw has attacked the palace and seized the arsenal, declaring Poland independent. For the moment, popular sentiment supports a rebellion, and war with Russia now seems inevitable. We should seek out patrons among the great powers who might help to legitimize our uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95072;A Polish Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95072;In the past decade the Russian Tsar has undermined the Polish constitution and is taking steps toward integrating Poland fully into Russia. Now it seems that the Poles have risen up in rebellion against the Tsar and are seeking patrons among the other Powers. If we acknowledged the rebellion as legitimate it would win us some influence over a prospective independent Poland, but it would antagonize Russia and could lead to further Polish separatism. Should we give diplomatic support to the Poles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95074;Ottoman Empire Surrenders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95074;Russia's armies have decisively defeated the Ottoman Empire and forced them to the peace table. As we feared, it appears that Russia will profit from this intervention a great deal more than $COUNTRY$ will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95075;The Treaty of Adrianople;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95075;The Ottoman Empire has been decisively defeated, and now the Christian powers of Europe have forced it to acknowledge the Greek kingdom. The Romanian principalities are now guaranteed by Russia, and Russia has annexed the mouth of the Danube and more of the Black Sea coast. Other national minorities in the Balkans will surely be encouraged to follow the example of the Greeks. This is a dark day for the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95254;Malacca Concession Demanded;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95254;Our mutual colonial ambitions in the East Indies are bringing us into increasing conflict with the British. Tensions are particularly high surrounding the Straits of Malacca, a key channel for mercantile navigation in the East. Something must be done to resolve the growing conflict between our merchants.\n\nNow the British have demanded that we withdraw from the Malay Peninsula and concede all our territories and influence north of the Straits to them. Should we concede our colony?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95256;Malacca Proposal Rebuffed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95256;The Dutch have refused our proposal and insist that they will retain their colonies in Malacca. Perhaps we must consider other means of persuading them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95670;The Return of the King;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95670;When our armies seized control of Assam, the Ahom king fled westward into British territory. We would very much like to have him in custody, so that we might eliminate all credible challenges to our sovereignty in Assam. The British colonial government, however, is hosting the fugitive king, no doubt hoping that his survival will destabilize our new holdings. We could demand his extradition, though the British would likely refuse and we could only force the issue by arms. Or, we could accept that he is lost to us and concentrate on suppressing the likely unrest in Assam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95672;The British Agree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95672;The last king of Assam is imprisoned in Ava, and the Assamese elites now have little choice but to acknowledge our rule. This is a proud day for the Burmese Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95673;The British Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95673;The British have refused to extradite the Assamese king, and now we must decide whether to make good on our threats. We could use their refusal to justify further expansion into East Bengal--- but we must realize that the British will also be viewing this conflict as an excuse to take some of our lands. Do we dare provoke the British? Or, must we back down and manage Assam as best we can?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95674;The Burmese Capitulate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95674;After hearing our refusal to release the Assamese king, the Burmese envoy artfully climbed down from his earlier intimations of war and took his leave. It seems that Burma dares not provoke us openly; and we four our part will happily let this king's allies sow unrest in Assam.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95675;Victory over the British;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95675;Having faced down the British on the field of battle, we have compelled their colonial government to acknowledge our rule in Assam and turn over the fugitive king. This is a proud day for the Burmese Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95676;Defeat by the British;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95676;In the end we were unable to withstand the British forces, and our entire western frontier is now threatened. We must prepare ourselves for further difficulties with British India in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95677;The Treaty of Yandabo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95677;Our armies are in disarray, and the British are marching on the palace. For peace the British envoy now demands that all of Assam and Arakan be transferred to British India, along with our southern coastline and a massive indemnity. This is a crushing indignity for the Empire, but the alternative appears to be total destruction. Will we sign this treaty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95678;After a crushing defeat by British colonial forces, Burma has conceded all of Assam to British India, along with Arakan and Burma's southward coastline. The Burmese court also agrees to pay a massive indemnity to the British colonial administration, in reparation for the cost of the war. Burma's power is shattered, and Britain ascends still further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95679;Treaty Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95679;The Burmese court has outrageously refused to accept our peace terms, despite their utter inability to resist our armed forces. We should expand our demands for their territory, and perhaps commit a few atrocities against their people for good measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97021;The Draft Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97021;King John VI has returned to Europe from his court in Rio de Janeiro, leaving the crown prince, Dom Pedro, to govern Brazil as his viceroy. The Portuguese Cortes has produced a new draft constitution which greatly reduces the powers of the monarch and raises the sensitive question of the status of Brazil.\nWhile the royal court was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was elevated to the status of a peer kingdom united with Portugal under one monarch, and many legal and commercial restrictions from the colonial period were removed. Now, the Portuguese nobility are agitating for Brazil's colonial status to be restored and Portugal's primacy re-established. If Brazil is returned to colonial dependency it will greatly upset the Brazilians, who feel that they deserve to be full citizens of the Portuguese nation. But, if Brazil's autonomy as a kingdom is respected we face massive reactionary unrest in Portugal. What should Brazil's status be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97022;Dom Pedro's Refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97022;When the new constitution reduced Brazil's autonomy, the young prince regent was informed that he would no longer need to oversee the regional government in Rio de Janeiro. But, after months of requests, commands, and outright threats from the Cortes, Dom Pedro has flatly refused to return to the royal court in Lisboa. The crown prince insists that he will carry on as Regent of Brazil, and it seems he has the support of many aggrieved Brazilian nobles and notables, who deeply resent Brazil's reduced status under the new constitution. The parliament is somewhat at a loss as to how it should rein in this rogue royal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97023;The Cry of Ipiranga;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97023;The die is cast. Hostilities between Brazilian independentists and Portuguese loyalists have erupted into open rebellion in America, and Dom Pedro has definitively taken the side of the rebellion. The Cortes sent the prince a letter informing him in no uncertain terms that the Brazilian government in Rio de Janeiro had been dissolved and that all who defied the Portuguese court would be punished by force. It is said that, upon reading the letter, Pedro immediately mounted his horse, drew his sword, and proclaimed Brazil's ties to Portugal forever severed. It seems that war is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97024;The End of the United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97024;The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves is no more. Brazil has won its independence, and the Portuguese Empire has lost its crowning jewel. Portugal's decline seems assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97025;The Brazilian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97025;Brazil stands victorious, and is now welcomed into the community of nations as a free and sovereign state. Our onetime prince regent Dom Pedro has acquiesced to the universal demand and accepted the crown of Brazil. He is now Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, first monarch of the Brazilian Empire. May our realm prosper and grow in peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97026;Brazil's Status;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97026;The new absolutist regime has suspended the constitution of 1822 and says it is determined to restore Brazil's colonial dependency upon Portugal. Having had its autonomy guaranteed once, Brazil can never accept subjugation without a fight. Armies are mustering on both sides, and war will now decide the fate of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97027;Demands of the Absolutists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97028;Full Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97028;A fiery speech delivered in parliament today is the talk of the nation. The impassioned orator decried Brazil's continued subordination to a crown four thousand miles away. Is it not time, he asked, that Brazil stood on its own and sought its own destiny? He speaks for a growing number of our people who feel that we have drifted apart from Portugal, that the Portuguese monarchy has done little to deserve our continued loyalty. Many believe it is time for full independence, and an end to the United Kingdom. Are we prepared to send an ultimatum to the Portuguese Cortes insisting on full Brazilian independence? Or, must the people's cry for freedom go unheard?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97029;A Brazilian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97029;A worrisome political movement in Brazil has begun to agitate for full independence from Portugal, and it seems now to have infected the Brazilian political class, as well. The regional government in Rio de Janeiro has submitted an ultimatum to the Cortes, announcing Brazil's intention to dissolve the United Kingdom and form an independent state. Of course, such a step would be intolerable for Portugal... unless we don't believe we can stop it. Acceding to Brazil's demands without a fight would humiliate Portugal and enrage our nationalists, but the only alternative now seems to be war. What is Portugal's response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97030;The Death of John VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97030;The king has died, and Portugal is faced with a dilemma. His older son, Pedro, is a constitutionalist and liberal darling, but he recently rebelled against his father and became Emperor of Brazil. The king's younger son, Miguel, is an absolutist and has the support of the reactionary aristocracy, but he has been in exile since a failed coup attempt.\nIf Pedro succeeded his father, it would bring Portugal and Brazil into a personal union, an outcome neither nation now wants. Instead, Pedro means to pass the Portuguese crown directly to his daughter, Maria da Gloria, after swearing that the Constitution will be upheld. Miguel, for his part, would take the crown and likely abolish the Cortes and the constitution, restoring absolute rule. Either ruler would provoke a backlash from the opposing camp. How will this crisis be resolved?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97031;Intervention in Portugal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97031;Portugal is in the midst of a succession crisis, with late King John VI's two sons struggling over the crown and the constitution. Pedro, previously the Brazilian Emperor, is now raising a liberal rebellion against the absolutist Miguel, and he has the support of the bourgeoisie in Porto and the Azores. With a small injection of arms and funds from us, his faction could likely restore constitutional rule in Portugal. Can we spare some ships and soldiers to covertly foment this rebellion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97039;An Iberian Destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97039;Portugal's dominant position on the Iberian Peninsula makes the formation of a pan-Iberian federation a real possibility. However, an increased emphasis on the nation's Iberian identity would likely upset our citizens overseas, who feel less attached to their Iberian heritage. Further, the formation of a Brazilian-Iberian state would seriously disturb the balance of power in Europe, upsetting the other Great Powers and risking their intervention. We could unite all of Iberia with Brazil and suffer the consequences to our reputation, or compromise by forming an Iberian Federation and devolving home rule to a Brazilian government. Or, we could turn our backs on the Iberian project and preserve our unification with Brazil. Which way does Portugal's destiny lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97040;A Peruvian Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97040;The regions of Upper and Lower Peru are linked by centuries of history, trade and politics. After independence, popular sentiment in both countries favored unification to form a great Confederation of the Perus. However, Simon Bolivar opposed such a confederation because it could challenge his Colombian federation for dominance among the former Spanish territories. His forces installed a friend as president in Bolivia as the war with the Spanish ended, but the Peruvian government believed that unification could be achieved if a change of leadership in Bolivia could be arranged, perhaps by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97041;The regions of Upper and Lower Peru are linked by centuries of history, trade and politics. After independence, popular sentiment in both countries favored unification to form a great Confederation of the Perus. However, Simon Bolivar opposed such a confederation because it could challenge his Colombian federation for dominance among the former Spanish territories. Our current president is a friend of Bolivar and would never agree to unification with Peru, but a change of leadership could be arranged, if we believed it to be in the nation's interest. If we refuse, the unionists in our nation could make things difficult for us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97042;Bolivia has repulsed our attacks, this time. Our interest in unification remains, and they may be convinced yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97043;War with Peru?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97043;Peru has forced out the Colombia-friendly government in Bolivia, and even now they are beginning negotiations to establish a Peruvian confederation to our south. Can we tolerate the emergence of such a rival power in South America? Surely Peru must be punished for ousting the governor we so carefully installed in Chuqisaca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97045;Confederation Conflicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97045;Both Bolivia and Peru now agree that a confederation must be formed between our nations. Unfortunately, we cannot seem to agree upon a political structure for that new polity. Essentially, both governments intend to dominate the confederation, and both are unwilling to concede any power to the other. Negotiations are ongoing, but little progress seems to be forthcoming. Perhaps we should simplify the process by letting arms speak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97046;The Three Republics;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97046;Peru has been divided into two republics, Northern Peru and Southern Peru. Both are now united with Bolivia under the central government in La Paz.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97047;The Peruvian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97047;Lower and Upper Peru are now united in a great confederation. Our people are still getting used to the idea, and certain factions in the north strongly resist the union. More importantly, our neighbors feel threatened and are likely to intervene to disrupt our project of unification. In these early days of our new nation, we should prepare for trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97078;Settling the Galapagos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97078;The Galapagos Islands off $COUNTRY$'s west coast have sheltered whalers in need of food, water and repairs for many decades, but they have never been permanently settled. The islands are rocky and barren, with little to recommend them as a home. Nevertheless, we should establish our legal sovereignty over them more firmly by founding a settlement and flying the flag. Perhaps we can ship some convicts over to harvest... whatever it is that grows there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97095;Constitutional Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97095;Having thrown off European tyranny, we are now free to choose the form of a new government for $COUNTRY$. Many among our elites and soldiers wish to see a strong central government led by a strong president, to stabilize and protect the nation. Others, however, worry that we may end by creating a dictatorship as bad as any monarchy, and would prefer a federal system that preserved more autonomy for the provinces.\n\nWhich is the best course for our nation: a more liberal constitution with greater separation of powers, or a more conservative document that centralizes power and concentrates authority in the president?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97133;With the arrival of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governor into $PROVINCENAME$, an effort has begun to incorporate $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $STATENAME$ into the larger Malayan administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97580;Union with Mexico?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97580;Our young nation stands at a crossroads. We have not yet had time to hold a constituent assembly, but the provisional governing council has just received a proposal from Mexico's transitional government: our six provinces are invited to join the new Mexican empire.\n\nOur liberals are divided: some are determined to have an independent republic, yet others approve of Mexico's liberal trade policies and prohibition of slavery. The conservatives and the clergy, however, are united: they wish to see us back under a proper Catholic monarchy. Which way does Central America's destiny lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97581;Annex Central America?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97581;The Central American provisional government in Guatemala City has petitioned to join its lands to the Mexican Empire. It isn't often that a nation can expand so dramatically without firing a shot--- but, if we fear overextension, we could still turn them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97582;Political Reorganization?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97582;Conflict in the Federal Republic has reached the boiling point. The Congress is now dominated by the voices of the regional separatists, who say they intend to enact a measure authorizing each province to "reorganize" its political structures--- that is, to secede from the Federation. Democratic rule seems to have failed Central America, and it is unclear how the union can be preserved from here. We could try using executive power to threaten any would-be secessionists with immediate war. Or, we could simply dissolve the Congress before the measure comes to a vote and try to maintain order until the crisis passes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164550;Khoja Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164550;An earthquake has devastated the Ferghana valley, and a Turkestani Muslim leader by the name of Jahangir Khoja has taken advantage of the chaos to raise a rebellion against Manchu rule. The Uighur peoples of the northwest are rallying behind him, and the imperial garrisons in the region's cities have been massacred. Qing cannot tolerate this sort of rabble rousing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190130;For years Borneo has been a common destination for Chinese workers and settlers, many of whom are enticed to work for the rich sultans of the island in precious metal mining communities - kongsi, as they are called by the Chinese. In 1777, a Hakka Chinese named Luo Fangbo established one kongsi in Pontianak as a full-fledged independent republic, co-existing peacefully the with neighboring sultans. It has helped protect Chinese settlers in Borneo for decades now, and as the first republic in the history of Asia, is a remarkably modern state for its time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190131;The Lanfang Republic is, although independent, a tributary state of the Qing Empire, and must pay occasional sums of money to the Emperor. In exchange, they ensure that new Chinese settlers from the mainland arrive safely in our capital, providing for a larger workforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190132;An envoy from the Lanfang Republic in the south has come to our court with their tribute, just as expected of them. In return, we should send Hakka settlers to Borneo, to ensure their future growth and strength, so that they may remain an independent Chinese presence in the southern islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190133;These last years have been tumultuous for Lanfang, but in the face of adversity, we have managed to become a modern, westernized country. There are still those in our midst who think that we have strayed too far from tradition, but most will agree that this is for the best. In order to hold Western imperialism back from our sacred borders, we must embrace what makes those same Westerners strong, and use it against them. Only in this way can we survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201070;A cache of human figurines made of worked gold have been uncovered in our Inca dig site. The craftsmanship is exceptional, and both the designs and the construction will give us meaningful insight into the culture and technology of the Inca people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201071;A Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201071;A breakthrough in the Andes! Our archaeologists have located a major Inca temple complex. Its walls are covered in brilliant frescoes depicting myths and religious ceremonies, and a number of tools, garments and textiles have been remarkably well preserved by the arid Andean climate. It is clear that the Inca were wealthier and more culturally sophisticated than was previously suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201072;The Golden Raft;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201072;After all the careful exploration of major Inca sites, the most dramatic breakthrough yet has come from a farming village. A ceramic vessel was unearthed, and inside was a breathtaking golden sculpture of an early Inca chief on a log raft, surrounded by priests and servants. Comparing the sculpture with frescoes from the temples and regional legends, we now believe that the chief painted himself with gold dust and leapt into a mountain lake to make offerings to appease the gods. It seems likely that this ritual is the ancient origin of the legend of "Golden Kings" that so tantalized Spanish explorers centuries ago. What a triumph for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316095;Leasing a Port?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316095;Envoys from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have approached us about leasing a port town on the Guangzhou coast in exchange for a substantial sum of money. The port is of no particular consequence and would never be missed, though we might wish to think twice before giving even more foreigners a foothold on our shores. Still, their proposal is respectful and their offer generous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316096;China Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316096;Our offer has been accepted, and control of the port town has been transferred to us. This will facilitate our trade with China and our Asian possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316097;China Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316097;Our offer has been turned down, and the Chinese seem offended that we even asked. If we still want a Chinese port, we'll have to get it the old-fashioned way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

henry_meiggs_title;Henry Meiggs' railways;;;;;;;;;;;;;
henry_meiggs_desc;The Andes make building railways in our country very difficult, but as fate would have it, an expert has arrived from America. Henry Meiggs, a brilliant businessman, has approached us proposing contracts all over the country following routes previously thought impassable to rail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
warri_protectorate_title;The Warri Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
warri_protectorate_desc;The Urhobo and Itsekiri people of the Niger delta have been feuding violently and both wish to gain the upper hand in the struggle. Thus, playing the two off against each other, we can propose treaties of protection with both. Gunboats have been regularly sent into the delta as a show of force to demonstrate British supremacy to the inhabitants. Combined with the chiefs' lack of reading or writing skills, especially in English, it should be easy to get them to sign over their sovereignty and then gradually exert control over them until we fully integrate them into the Niger Coast Protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
calabar_protectorate_title;The Calabar Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
calabar_protectorate_desc;The coastal kingdom of Calabar has long been on good terms with Britain. Already asking for protection in 1846, this was denied due to the Calabarese practice of human sacrifice of wives and slaves upon the death of their master, which they abolished soon after. Since then, relations have been constantly improving, with missionaries slowly spreading Christianity and Queen Victoria even sending King Archibong III jewelry for his coronation. Calabar is now once more threatened by its stronger neighbors and requests we accept it as a protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
benin_expedition_title;The Benin Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
benin_expedition_desc;Rich in rubber, palm-oil and ivory, the Kingdom of Benin is our most influential trading partner on the Niger Coast. Henry Gallwey, the Vice-Consul of the Niger Coast Protectorate visited it recently to sign a free trade treaty, describing it as described it 'a place of gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death'. This treaty was however immediately broken by the Oba of Benin who demanded tariffs continue. When traders refused this, he cut off trade to our Protectorate, harming its economy significantly. The acting Consul-General, James Robert Phillips, organized a troop to invade the kingdom to depose the Oba. However, as they were resting in a nearby village unarmed, a Beninese surprise attack wiped the force out. Now, London newspapers' headlines are covered with the 'Benin Massacre'. Action must be taken to avenge this heinous act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_aro_war_title;The Aro War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_aro_war_desc;The Aro Confederacy of eastern Nigeria is one of the last holdouts of opposition to our rule. Raids on the outskirts of our territory to capture new slaves pose a threat to the stability of the Niger Coast Protectorate and it is our moral duty to put an end to the evils of slavery. Sir Ralph Moor, High Commissioner of the Niger Coast Protectorate has suggested we invade to end the slave raids and trade and impose British rule, spreading Christianity, western trading and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
