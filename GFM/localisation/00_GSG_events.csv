EVTNAME44360;Louis Riel Gains Public Notice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44360;The noted Louis Riel has become a figurehead amongst his people. He calls for increased rights for Metis people across Canada. Unique among his number, the young Riel has quickly risen to prominence due to his eloquent speech, his education, and his earnest beliefs. Leaving him alive would be a great example of Canada's freedom of speech, but the government can pull a few strings in order to effect a policy beneficial to the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44360;We are a free country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB44360;Ensure his silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44361;William McDougall;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44361;The Anglo-Canadian gentleman William McDougall has been proposed to be the Lieutenant Governor of the troubled Rupert's Land/North West Territories. His invaluable service and experience in the past puts him in a prime position to manage the territories, but some believe his anti-French and Anti-Metis policies to be too heavy-handed for the troubled territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44361;He will do nicely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB44361;The climate calls for a lighter hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44362;The Red River Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44362;The Red River Rebellion, later referred to as the First Riel Rebellion, was a rebellion that occurred soon after Canadian Confederation. The Canadian Government had installed an anti-French and anti-Metis lieutenant governor, William McDougall, in the newly-bought North West Territory. When McDougall sent surveyors into what would eventually be the province of Manitoba, the restless Metis inhabitants sent their own delegation to intercept these surveyors and proclaimed the existence of the Metis Confederation. Historically, they established a provisional government in the new Confederation, which the Canadian Government tolerated while the situation developed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44362;Let the situation develop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB44362;Acknowledge their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44363;The Execution of Thomas Scott;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44363;Thomas Scott, an Orangeman of Irish descent, was executed by Louis Riel during the Red River Rebellion for conspiring against the self-proclaimed Metis provisional government. Historically, Riel wished to show the world that the Metis peoples were demanding to be taken seriously, but the Canadian Government viewed this action by Riel as a step too far and outfitted the Wolseley Expedition to quell the Rebellion. After conflicts with the Metis, Louis Riel was captured and exiled to the United States. With this, the Red River Rebellion was crushed, but the Metis and Native peoples would not soon forget this act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44363;Our hands are tied. Outfit the expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44364;The Return of Louis Riel and the Second Riel Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44364;After being elected to parliament three times in absentia after his exile, Louis Riel returned to Canada in 1884. Using increased Metis and Native cohesion, the ailing Riel managed to assemble a loose coalition to reattempt his rebellion for Metis independence in 1885. Historically, this rebellion was a failure due to internal strife amongst Rebellion leaders, an increasingly ill and megalomaniacal Riel, and increased Federal cohesion. Canada was no longer a fledgling nation just getting on its feet, and quickly moved to wipe out Riel and his rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44364;We have no time for this. Let them be independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB44364;A United Canada is best for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC44364;The Metis have gone too far and must know their place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44365;Louis Riel's Fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44365;Historically, after surrendering to the Canadian forces after his failed rebellion, the Canadian Government held a quick trial in what can be best called a kangaroo court. Held in a hostile city before a jury of purely Anglo-Canadian Protestant jurors, the Catholic Metis Louis Riel was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death after a trial lasting only five days. Louis Riel refused to plea insanity, instead delivering two heartfelt speeches to the court, and later asserting to his lawyer that "Life, without the dignity of an intelligent being, is not worth having." Louis Riel was hanged on the 18th of September, 1885. His rebellions and the spirit of the Metis would largely die with him, but in due time he would be remembered as a folk hero amongst White, Metis, and Native people alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME203800;Anti-Terrorism Coalition Proposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203800;A group of wealthy capitalists from your country has come to you after the recent attack on the Statue of Liberty. They propose an anti-terrorism coalition force to protect our country from any possible terrorist attacks. They are all upstanding capitalists and the core of your economy, but they also propose a different option: technological progress and ethical flexibility.

EVTDESC203771;\n\nThe recently-elected Fascist party has used its position of superiority to maneuver around the country. Their plans have come to fruition, and through legalistic means, they have turned the country into a dictatorship headed by their Leader. Although they promise to bring the nation to a new era of prosperity and strength, their brutal methods and recent disregard for the law is seen by some as an affront to humanity itself. The supporters of the left will, of course, be mad about this, but only time will tell whether or not this new regime will be successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME203772;Communist Takeover of Government!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203772;\n\nThe recently-elected Communist party has used its position of superiority to maneuver around the country. Their plans have come to fruition, and through legalistic means, they have turned the country into a dictatorship nominally headed by their council. Although they promise to bring the nation to a new era of equality and prosperity for all, their inflammatory rhetoric and alleged deeds is seen by some as an affront to individualism and humanity itself. The supporters of the right will, of course, be mad about this, but only time will tell whether or not this new regime will be successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203700;The Republican Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203700;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of "now or never". Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d'etat and tried to institute a republic on November 15, 1889. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He only commented:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA203700;If this is how it is, I will retire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB203700;Crush the rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203701;The Golden Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203701;The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was sanctioned by Isabel, Imperial Princess of Brazil, who was regent at the time while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. It was signed on May 13, 1888 and was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It had only two articles. The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves - Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA203701;From this date, slavery is declared abolished in Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB203701;Free slaves? Revoke this useless law!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203702;The Rise of Getulio Vargas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203702;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME203775;The Fascist Movement Arises;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203775;\n\nA group of far-right extremists has begun to organize within the country, and their pamphlets have recently become a thorn in our regime's side. Their views are on the fringe, and their methods of spreading their views have been clandestine so far. They preach order, unity, strength, homogenous cultures, and national exceptionalism, and while this may please the common man, they are still a potential threat to our regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA203775;Keep an eye on them. Do you have the latest stock ticker?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203776;The Fascists Go Openly Public;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203776;\n\nThanks to increased awareness of the fascist platform amongst our people, the fascist organizations within our nation have begun to go public in their demonstrations. They have begun to stalk the streets, intimidating others, and have attacked their communist ideological enemies. This roughhousing may or may not be good for the nation, but we can't explicitly support one side or the other without changing our regime or committing political suicide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA203776;Let the fascists play at politics a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB203776;We must keep order in the streets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203777;Fascist Rallies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203777;\n\nThe local fascist organizations have largely united and created a series of awareness-raising and strength-flaunting rallies. These rallies have the amazing ability to inspire people and convert them to the fascist cause, and even have the potential to influence our very government. The communist and liberal groups within our nation have been pestering us to make a decision about these extremists, and this is surely a defining moment in our nation's politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA203777;I have to admit that their slogans are appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB203777;This has gone on for far too long. This must end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203805;Greater Denmark rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203805;Given our glorious status in the world, nationalists within our country have taken it upon themselves to encourage a rebirth of our ancestral Viking roots.

This will, of course, worry the rest of the world, but what are they compared to the glory and might of our nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If Lucky Nations are turned on, ten random westernized nations who are not Great Powers and five random non-western nations will be given special bonuses that will enable them to shake up the status quo of the world by giving them significant bonuses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC11202;France has expressed interest in our union of Italy. They ask for us to return to them Savoie, which has a sizable French population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11203;French Claims in Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11203;France has expressed interest in our union of Italy. They ask for us to return to them Savoie, which has a sizable French population. In addition, they also demand Piemonte. If we accede to both of these demands our union of Italy will surely been seen as flimsy excuse to divide Italy between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC11204;How should we deal with the Papal State in our union of Italy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11205;Freedom or Subservience?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11205;Should we establish our union of Italy as a truly independent state, or as a puppet to the Austrian crown? Granting them independence would help legitimize the actions we've taken so far, both in the eyes of the other greater powers and in the eyes of the Italian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188112;General Volkhovski's Landing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188112;One of the first events of the restarted Caucasian War was General Volkhovski's landing in Circassia, near the modern town of Sochi. Originally plagued by setbacks due to Circassian resistance and poor organization, it was a good start and learning experience for the Russian armed forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188112;Let the landing commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188112;Let us bide our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188113;Conflict at Tepsue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188113;The Russians made a large landing at Tepsue soon after the Caucasian War restarted, intending to crush opposition in western Circassia after their successful occupation of eastern Circassia a decade earlier. Historically, the occupation was a reasonable success, yet casualties were very high on both sides and neither belligerent forgot the lessons learned during this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188113;We will crush the Circassians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188113;We will do what is necessary and no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188114;Colonel Obshevski Gives A Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188114;Historically, soon after the conflict at Tepsue, Russian Colonel Obshevski gave a speech to the local Circassian population about the advantages of being under Russian control and the virtues of not rebelling against their Russian masters. The Circassians did not forget it, to the detriment of the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188115;Imam Shamil Gains Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188115;Imam Shamil has gained power and become the Imam of the Caucasian Imamate! His frequent attacks against Russian outposts throughout the region are worrisome, and a decision is needed as to what to do with his resistance movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB188115;Attempt to pull out of our weaker outposts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188116;United Circassian Offensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188116;The Circassian resistance has managed to take out our minor outposts through sneak attacks, seizing supply depots, and what can be termed guerrilla warfare. Although we have suffered much, our ready state of alertness prevented an overly large massacre of our people and has prevented our major outposts and fortresses from being overrun by the Circassians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188116;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188117;United Circassian Offensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188117;Although we attempted to pull out of our weaker outposts, the Circassians have ambushed our traveling forces and seized our supplies. Our larger outposts relied on these smaller reinforcements to properly defend, and we have suffered some losses in our major military and civilian centers. This perceived weakness has given the Circassians free reign to massacre our people, and has shamed us on a world scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188117;An unfortunate event, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188118;Imam Shamil Offers a Truce;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188118;Imam Shamil has stated his demands regarding the Caucasus: independence, a return to the status quo of 1834, or death! Historically, the Imam and the Tsar agreed to a peace treaty, which was respected for almost a decade, as it worked out to both sides' advantage. The Russians had been humiliated at the Caucasus, but the Circassians could not hold out much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188118;They will pay in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188118;Let them go, we have failed in the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188119;Unrest in the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188119;There is increased unrest as of late, as Imam Shamil has begin a campaign of peaceful resistance and invective, wanting independence for his people and the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188119;This has gone on too long. Send in the troops!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188119;Organize our forces but do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188120;Imam Shamil Stands Firm;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188120;Imam Shamil has released an ultimatum: Caucasian independence or indefinite rebellion. His troops have already seized Russian supply depots and a few outposts, and as such he has dishonorably broken our treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188120;We will not stand this insolence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EBTOPTB188120;This is the last straw. Let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188121;Victories in the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188121;A string of military and civil victories in the Caucasus has led to the breaking of most Circassian resistance! Imam Shamil is on the run and the back of the resistance is broken! It seems that the war that has raged for almost a hundred years is almost over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB188121;Let the rebel scum suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188122;Ethnic Cleansing of the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188122;Historically, soon after major victories in the Caucasus, the Russians purged the area of any undesirable elements. The ethnic cleansing continued until the 1870s, as many natives of the area were killed or deported to the Ottoman Empire. Indeed, the ethnic cleansing of the area has been considered by many historians to be the first ethnic cleansing on a modern scale and the harbinger of genocides as a concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188122;We have fought for a hundred years. Let them suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188122;We need not descend into barbarism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188123;Imam Shamil Captured;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188123;Historically, Imam Shamil was captured in 1859. The Russians allowed him to live, albeit under surveillance in Kiev. The mutual respect that the Imam and the Tsar had for each other helped quite a bit in this aspect, and Imam Shamil saw the war as lost from this point. Although resistance continued in the Caucasus, the ideological center of the movement was removed, and the ideological foundation of the resistance foundered. Imam Shamil himself received permission from the Tsar to go on the Hajj to Mecca in 1869. He briefly stopped at Istanbul where he was greeted warmly by the Ottoman Sultan, but continued on his way to Mecca. He died shortly after completing the pilgrimage in 1871, a truly remarkable figure in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188123;Let him live free, but keep an eye on him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB188123;Let him suffer the fate of all traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188124;The End of the Caucasian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188124;The last pockets of resistance have foundered, the rebellion is leaderless, tens of thousands lie dead, and the Circassian/Caucasian War has finally ended after 100 years of bloodshed. The people of the Caucasus now know their place in the Russian Empire, but such wars are not that easy to forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is cries for independence, or at the very least, increased autonomy from $COUNTRY$. Refusing will no doubt greatly upset the other great powers as well as our population. Many voices in Government say that granting our non-German territories independence or even just extended autonomy is the best course of action in order to minimize damage to our reputation on the world stage as well as satisfying our population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was arguably formed as a musical genre in 1912 with the publishing of Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues", but has its roots in traditional slave songs of the 19th century. Most famously, blues later became the bedrock for the most popular musical sensation of them all: rock n' roll.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT187670DESC;\n\nThe city of New Orleans always has had an association with the festival of Mardi Gras, a Christian cultural celebration taking place prior to the season of Lent brought to the area by French Catholic colonists.

EVT187690DESC;\n\nFounded in 1871, the National Rifle Association was originally a set of shooting clubs organized to improve the marksmanship of American soldiers. After the Civil War, it was noted that few shots fired actually hit their targets, so improved drill was in order. These shooting clubs improved skill with firearms, and contributed to the military as a whole moving away from the classic style of rank and file warfare, which put focus on volume of fire rather than accuracy.

EVT187730DESC;\n\nThough our war with the Confederate States is far from over, it isn't going either poorly or well.

EVTDESC187870;\n\nWith the loss of our colonies in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, there really is no point in maintaining slavery in this modernizing world. Rather than a step forward in the name of liberty, this is more or less a formality, but certainly the people won't see the difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187880;Historically, Brazil and the Confederate States of America enjoyed warm relations, even during the Civil War. Shall we foster an alliance between these two nations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187890;\n\nThere are a growing number of Freemasons within Brazilian churches, which is nominally prohibited in Catholicism - they exist most commonly within Lay Fraternities, which are generally charitable organizations chiefly associated with local churches, though technically independent in their operation. Historically, however, the church in Brazil has been an apparatus of the state, rather than being independent, thus making religious issues in Brazil matters of the state, not the Catholic Church. Local bishops have been calling for Freemason clergymen to resign, including a man named Dom Vital, who has issued an interdict against certain Lay Fraternities that have refused to have their Freemason brothers resign, preventing any sacraments from being celebrated within these Fraternity buildings. This goes against the state control of the Church, so the Lay brothers say, and is a direct challenge to government power considering that certain members of Parliament are noted Freemasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187892;\n\nDom Vidal has refused to annul his controversial interdict, and has been joined in protest by the bishop Antonio de Macedo Costa, who has recently passed a similar interdict against uncooperative Lay Fraternities. This refusal could be used as a reason to arrest and imprison the bishops, hopefully preventing them from causing more trouble in the future, and to remove them as challenges to the authority of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187894;\n\nVidal and Costa have been imprisoned for acting against the power of the sovereign Brazilian state, causing shock and anger amongst the Catholic populace in the country. The New Prime Minister, a Freemason and a Catholic himself, has called for his own resignation in the case that amnesty is not granted to Costa and Vidal. We have little choice at this point, considering that keeping the bishops in prison would only lead to the government crumbling. It seems we've been dragged into a situation in which we cannot end things positively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187900;\n\nWith the Civil War having swung in favor of the Confederate States, there is a growing secessionist movement in the city of New York, with locals calling for New York City to leave the Union and follow its own, independent path. With each passing day this movement gains more popularity, and this certainly will cause a problem in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187901;\n\nThe inevitable has come to pass. The city of New York has ordered a referendum amongst the people, calling for secession from the United States of America. The results, legitimate or otherwise, show that the people of New York are overwhelmingly in favor of secession, and the city's officials have made it abundantly clear that, should independence be denied, there will be another Civil War at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187902;\n\nWe are at war for our freedom! This conflict will not be an easy one, but there certainly must be other countries that can aid us in achieving the independence that we need. Shall we seek them out, or face American wrath alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187903;\n\nCivil war rages in America, and the people of New York City have requested that we aid them in their conflict. If we choose to do so, it may anger people within our own country who seek independence, and certainly the Americans will be less than pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187904;\n\nDiplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have declared that their nation is fully in support of New York's independence, and that we can expect to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ military and economic aid in the times to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC187910;\n\nInspired by the liberal revolutions in Europe, a party of Liberals in Brazil, calling themselves the Praieiros, has begun stirring up tensions in our country. They hope to bring an end to slavery, and also expand Brazilian voting rights, in order to make a more free country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187914;\n\nThe young Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, is yet too young to rule the country, due to his father abdicating in 1831 in order to restore his daughter Maria to her rightful throne of Portugal. Until the child Emperor is of age, the country will be looked over by parliamentary officials and a court of regents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187916;Dom Pedro II, the Magnanimous, has passed away this morning. The people of Brazil loved him until the very end, and his impeccable rulership brought a true golden age to the Empire of Brazil. Working towards the cause of abolition and civil freedom, Dom Pedro made many influential friends, with his various associates, from Friedrich Nietzsche and Alexander Graham Bell to Victor Hugo and Charles Darwin. An intellectual and a devoted emperor, in his later years he found himself disappointed with the role of a ruler, so perhaps with his passing he has achieved the happiness that eluded him all his life. His last words were 'May God grant me these last wishes: peace and prosperity for Brazil!';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187917;The imperial administration of Dom Pedro II has, with the recent coup and overthrow of the government, been reduced to dust. The emperor has officially and willingly abdicated the throne, and has not tried to retake it or resist the end of the Empire. Government of the country is being transferred to a council of able governors, and the royal family of Brazil and Portugal are hereby exiled from this country for ever more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187925;\n\nA free man of black ancestry has given a speech at a national university. Many were impressed by his eloquence and the intelligence in his arguments against slavery, saying that "in a land of freedom, we celebrate the sight of a man in chains". He could become a major force in the cause of abolitionism, and already pro-slave politicians have demanded that his speeches be censored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE187926;Progressive Society in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187926;\n\nCapitalists have formed what they call a "Progressive Society" in $PROVINCENAME$, hoping to bring an end to slavery. Their reasoning is that slavery, as a rural, plantation-based economic model, has no place in a nation attempting to industrialize and compete in the modern economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE187930;$PROVINCENAME$ Slaves and Marx;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187930;\n\nIn the plantation fields of $PROVINCENAME$, the sound of "The Internationale" can be heard more loudly and frequently than old slave songs. Many working slaves, having learned to read, have also learned about the philosophies of men like Karl Marx, and his vision of a world without social classes. What they intend should be obvious, considering their situation in our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE187935;Cheap Labor in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187935;\n\nFactories dot the landscape where once there used to be plantations and farms that ran on the blood and sweat of slaves. In this new $COUNTRY$, though, employers have begun hiring cheap workers, often immigrants, because the cost of keeping slaves has become unsustainable for many. Arguments could be made against them that they are sabotaging the economy, but in a free economy, they have the right to employ whomever they choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187940;\n\nTwo Confederate diplomats, hoping to establish good relations with our country, are aboard the HMS Trent. We have received urgent news lately, however, that the American USS San Jacinto has intercepted the Trent and taken the diplomats as prisoners. This can be seen as an act of war on British territory, and many are calling for an American apology and reparations for this insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187942;\n\nWe have received word that the British, after their HMS Trent was commandeered by a Union captain on the USS San Jacinto. The Trent is carrying two Confederate diplomats, en route to Britain and France, no doubt in order to coerce them into joining the war. The British are demanding an apology from our officials and the immediate release of the diplomats, and have been making isolated showings of force along the Canadian border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187943;\n\nDelegates from the United States have apologized and released the two Confederate envoys into British care. They made several demonstrations that they would not interfere with British shipping in any way in the future, and our own officials came back quite pleased with the meeting. Of course, at this point we certainly cannot join the Confederates, or offer them any support, in light of tense Anglo-American relations as a result of the Trent affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187944;\n\nThe United States has begun to position troops along its border with our colony in Canada, making it clear that they will not back down. Official delegates from the United States government declare that what they did was only an act of war against the Confederates, but if British diplomats press the Trent issue, then the Union will consider Britain on the side of the Confederate secessionists, and react accordingly. It seems that there is no choice now but war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187918;\n\nIn the Brazilian navy, the use of the dreaded lash to discipline soldiers has been officially banned for several years. However, many white officers still use it to keep their typically black, sometimes even ex-slave crews in line, causing accusations of institutionalized discrimination in the military. Several all-black crews have recently revolted against their officers, taken control of their ships, and are in port outside Rio de Janeiro, threatening to bombard the city. They are demanding amnesty and reparations, and an end to discrimination, a promise we may not be able to completely deliver.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187919;\n\nThough the Atlantic slave trade has been dismantled by the British, many traders in Brazil have found ways to smuggle slaves into our country. Here in $PROVINCENAME$, new slaves have been sold into plantations; they may improve our economy, but the British may eventually catch on if we don't put an end to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187920;\n\nNear the Bagagem River, a young slave girl has found a priceless treasure: a massive diamond, certainly one of the biggest in the world. The girl, for finding this gem, has been granted her freedom, and since then the diamond, called the Star of the South, has come into our possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187921;\n\nIn order to protect the scenery and nature of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ wilderness, a service has been created to allow the flora and fauna of this country to thrive unhindered. This National Parks Service will prevent the natural environment from being unnecessarily overrun by human development, and will show to $COUNTRY$, her people, and the world, the true beauty of the wilderness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187922;\n\nDue to its fertile farmland, fair weather, close access to the Pacific and abundance of natural resources - including gold! - the state of California is rapidly booming in population, showing an unprecedented demographic increase due to natural increase and mass immigration. California will be an integral part of $COUNTRY$ in no time, and this upward trend does not look to be ending soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187923;\n\nBeing a constitutional monarch, our Emperor Dom Pedro II has quite a lot of time to travel the world and meet the many personalities therein. With his daughter Isabel at home as his regent, Dom Pedro is able to visit Egypt, Britain, Austria and France, speaking with intellectuals and even ordinary people. He always demands that he is treated as just a man, and not an emperor, and he has gained considerable fame overseas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC187924;\n\nCalifornia's population has drastically increased over a short period of time, and while for a time this was one of the largest migrations in our country's history, it has now begun to slow, to a trickle. California is still booming, but perhaps not as strongly as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He asked the legislature to revise the Constitutional Governmental Regulations. Years later, a new constitution granted López powers as broad as those Francia had used to govern. Congress could make and interpret the laws, but only the President could order that they be promulgated and enforced. The constitution placed no restrictions on the powers of the president, beyond limiting his term of office to ten years. The constitution also included no guarantee of civil rights. There was no mention of the word liberty in the entire text. Despite this limitation, Congress subsequently named López dictator for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4661006;\n\nThe border between Bolivia and Argentina has long been under influence of Caudillos from both countries, the provinces being raided and conquered numerous times. The Bolivians conquered Cochinoca, an Argentine province, using the attempt to stop Argentinian Caudillos from raiding Bolivia's countryside as the justification. After the recent war the Argentine took Cochinoca and Tarija, the latter being claimed by some Argentine northern Caudillos as being part of Argentina but that province long has been under the rule of Bolivia and has mainly a Bolivian population. Now with the post-war peace talks, our diplomats proposed that we raise the question of the settlement of the borders between Bolivia and Argentina.

EVTNAME201009;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Denies Access;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201009;\n\nUnfortunately, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to give us access to the Andes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201010;Archaeological Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201010;\n\nA foreign power has asked for access to the old ruins of Mesopotamia. An expedition of archaeologists was send, lead by representative of the National $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Museum. They are willing to pay and are also willing to share some of their newly made discoveries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201011;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Gives Access;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201011;\n\nThe government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to give full access regarding our expedition in the region of Mesopotamia. Our researches can begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201012;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Denies Access;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201012;\n\nThe evil $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ are not willing to give us access. In fact, they have denied us every right to visit their lands for now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201013;Archaeological Exhibition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201013;\n\n$COUNTRY$ has become a leading nation in the field of Archaeology. Excavations are held in many exotic places, and our National Museum in $CAPITAL$ has become a major place of archaeological artifacts. A highly regarded exhibition is held this week, to celebrate our newly made research in Africa, Asia and Southern America. In fact, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologists are highly regarded in the world. Precious artifacts, amazing sarcophaguses and ancient steles or sculptures are exposed by them on this occasion. People of our nation, neighbors, and even other great powers are guests. Our efforts cause recognition, pride and envy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201014;Archaeological Exhibition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201014;\n\nIn $FROMCOUNTRY$, a major archaeological exhibition is held. Finest artifacts and spectacular items are exposed, and it seems, that it becomes a worldwide event. Our own scientists are ashamed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201015;$COUNTRY$, a Backward Country?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201015;\n\nThe last archaeological exhibition was not without it side effects. We were mocked as "backward scientists". Without excavations and expeditions, our prestige has suffered in the international scene. To make things worse: we lack even the basics of archaeological science. If we want to catch up, we must better our methods and educate a new generation of scientists. But without practice, we won't get further. As we can't get access to the exotic places of this world, a commission has proposed to gain experience in a local excavation. If we have an organized and professional troop of archaeologists, we may have more chances in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201017;Local Excavation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201017;\n\nIt seems, that after years of practicing and studying, our scientists have found an interesting place, which was mostly neglected in the past. After weeks of work, we have managed to find old tombs of a prehistoric times. Our archaeologists have gained experience and are looking forward. It seems, that we have started our own archaeological project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201018;Archaeological Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201018;\n\nModern science is on the rise. $COUNTRY$, a highly regarded nation of historians, philologues and archaeologists, is well-known for its researches. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Archaeological Institute was founded today as an association of these groups to make our efforts even more effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201019;A Famous Archaeologist;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201019;\n\nA member of our Archaeological society has become a leading expert with worldwide reputation and many successful excavations all around the world. He introduced new methods and wrote a guide for future generations. He is seen as the most talented man in this field, and $COUNTRY$ is proud of his famous son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201021;An Old Stele;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201021;\n\nDeep in the jungle, our archaeologists have found an old stele of the classical period. This artifact is not only a wonderful piece of art, but will give us new insight in the ancient world of the Mayas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201022;Mysterious Maya Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201022;\n\nHaze lays above the forests and hills of Yucatan. The mist clears up, as our expedition keeps going through the wild and awkward jungle. Jaguars and other ferocious beasts are living in this unspoiled nature. Savages has hunted a group of our team and injured many. They were doomed. Others were infected by Malaria, victims of the feared and bloodthirsty Mosquitos. Only a little grouplet of three persons has survived the exertions. The leader, a man with three-day stubble and a bull-whip in his hand, gives a sign to rest for a while. Steles and rocks with engravings. The whole territory is marked by them. The archaeologist's eyes flit over stairs, destroyed and mossy. The ancient ruin of a Maya pyramid. He pricks up his ears, as one of the heavers raises his hand and shouts: "Hombre, I think I found the entrance!";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201023;\n\nOur expedition has found an ancient Maya Pyramid in the middle of the jungle of Yucatan. And even more, our chief-archaeologist, René Emile Belloq, was able to get a holy idol, which was coincidentally in the hand of a fedora-wearing American archaeologist. Unfortunately, this poor man was slain by savages of the local Hovito tribe, as Belloq affirms. Now, this wonderful idol will be our new tourist attraction in the Mesoamerican section of the Louvre!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201025;Expedition Members Eaten by Dinosaurs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201025;\n\nThe members of our last expedition in the unexplored jungles of Yucatan have returned without success. The survivors, emaciated, pale and littered with scars, have lost even their equipment and are happy that they were able to return. But the director of the Archaeological Museum rose his eyebrows, when they were forced to tell, what happened to the other team members, the heavers and the equipment. The leading archaeologists shouted like a maniac, made wild gesticulations and told, that they were lost in a hidden valley, in the middle of the jungle, unknown to anyone. In this valley, prehistoric animals like dinosaurs and other extinct creatures lived and attacked the expedition. He continued his fantastic story, becoming even more exaggerated, and was finally brought in a sanatory. We don't know what happened, but this man has clearly lost his mind. Now we must start from the scratch. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201026;El Mirador Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201026;\n\nRuins in the jungle as far as the eye can reach. These remains are old - very old, as our archaeologists affirm. This huge city is one of the biggest places ever found in Yucatan, and it dates back to pre-classical times. El Mirador, one of the oldest and greatest settlements of the Mayan culture, was rediscovered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201027;A Mayan Riddle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201027;\n\nFootsteps resound in the hall. Light is rare, only a torch illuminates engraved walls. Silence. You go farther, through a corridor. Observing the plates on the ground, the roots of enormous trees, which break through the collapsed ceiling. An amazing place. You take a breath. A breath of history, which floatens this atmosphere. Then, after minutes of walking through mossy corridors, you find a monumental gate, decorated with faces and hieroglyphs. A short view in your book later, you are able to read what the Mayas wrote centuries ago on this wall. It's a riddle: "The farmer needs it/ the capitalist loves it/ and builds even factories/ but you hate it./ If you stockpile the/ most useless good in/ the world you will/ uncover the truth.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201028;The Idol;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201028;\n\nYou fetch your bag with fertilizer. (Every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist has his bag with fertilizer with him, as everyone knows, because of the famous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fertilizer Decree, which enforces every archaeologist to take a bag of fertilizer with him, because nobody in the world wants to buy it and $COUNTRY$ searches ways to get rid of it.) In front of you stands an altar. Gold sparkles in the glimmering light. An Mayan idol. A skeptical look to it. A look to the bag. You weigh the bag in your hand, estimating the weight of the idol. Fertilizer runs out of the bag. It is now lighter. You are waiting for the moment, staring at the idol, the bag with fertilizer in the left hand, your right hand on the head of the artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201029;It's a Trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201029;\n\nYou are able to replace the idol. The bag of fertilizer lays on the altar. You look in the face of the strange idol, enjoying the beauty of Mayan art. Savoring this moment, only for a little while. Noises. Brutal, loud noises interrupt the scene. You look upward. Something has changed. The muffled noise becomes louder. Something is rolling. Something big. Very big. A gigantic stone ball!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201030;\n\nYou escape through the corridors, the idol in your right hand, but the trap is triggered. A gigantic stone ball is rolling right behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201031;An Evil Frenchman;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201031;\n\nWith a last jump you are able to reach the exit of the pyramid, landing in the grass of the jungle - and cornered by Mesoamerican Indios. A voice with a soft French accent sounds in the near. A man in white clothes looks at you, amused by your escape. "It is nice to meet you. But I think, this artifact should be in better hands than yours." You are forced to surrender, as the heavers were killed by the tribe. "Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do" is your only response. Your are able to flee - but without the idol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201032;Leaving the Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201032;\n\nOn your way out of the pyramid, you clutch at a root in the ceiling. The idol in the left, the root in the right, the stone ball rolls under your shoes, through the corridor, and crashes in the jungle. You slump down, following the devastation. As you reach the exit, you see smashed bodies of Indios, scattered spears and weapons. It seems, that someone prepared an ambush, which was dissolved by the huge ball. Not sure, what happened here, but now, that the expedition was a full success, it is time to return to $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201033;An Archive of Cuneiform Tablets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201033;\n\nClay tablets were used as writing medium in the ancient middle east. Imprinted cuneiform characters can give us a whole new viewing of the old times of Babylonia. Satisfyingly, our archaeologists have found a whole archive of old tablets on their last expedition. They believe, that this archive was part of a large palace of an unknown ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201034;Sumerian Palace Found;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201034;\n\nToday is an exceptional day for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology. After months of research and excavations, our team has found an old palace, dating back to Sumerian times. Our archaeologists estimate, that this structures are over 5000 years old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201035;Mesopotamian Expedition Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201035;\n\nThe archaeological team in Mesopotamia is in a bad crisis. It seems, that the place of research was miscalculated by the chief-archaeologists. In fact, they have searched for month at the false place, finding nothing and remaining only with dirt in their hands. That is a heavy setback for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201036;The Tower of Babel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201036;\n\nScientific research and aerial photos leave no doubt: Babylon, once a myth and known in the west only as a decadent city mentioned in the Bible, is now a well known place of modern archaeology. The Hanging Gardens of Semiramis and a large palace were found and carefully examined. Archives full of clay tablets were translated. But the most prestigious trove was the discovery by an $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist, who confirmed that even the legendary Tower of Babel is not a fable, but has historical roots. A large building was found, believed as the example for the story in the Bible. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201040;Preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201040;\n\nThe Andes are rough and dangerous. Our archaeologists should be well equipped before we send them in the mountains. A list of goods was made, which the expedition demands. We should prepare 1 airplane, 1 off-road vehicle, 2 units of canned food and 3 barrels of fuel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201041;The Expedition Begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201041;\n\nThe Peruvian sun scorches our skin. We have left Cusco one week ago, entering the endless lands of mountains. The majesty of the Andes is overwhelming, and the ravines deep like the gorges of hell. Henry, my fellow student from twenty years ago, has joined this journey to undiscovered lands. His nose and eyes are deepened in a book. "So, this was the way they took?", he asks en passant. "No wonder they got lost." My only response is a nod. Henry is an experienced archaeologist, a highly regarded personality. Unlike me, he was able to climb the career ladder. They say, that he would be able to find Alexander's tomb in a second, only wandering in its near - when others dug for centuries, only excavating some old chicken bones. "The aeroplane is ready", I mention, wiping the sweat from my eyebrows. It's the moment, when Henry puts his book away. "Aeroplane?", sounds his voice skeptically, "I don't like them. You know, I get sick in these darn machines. What about the car the government offered us?";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201042;An Old Bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201042;\n\nI follow Henry's advice. I'm the official leader of this expedition, but I know Henry's aversion against these new technologies. When we began with our studies at the university, our professors put us for days in dirty holes, only equipped with a rusty shovel and outdated instruments. Now, everything has changed. The methods, the equipment. Even a car. "That's a fine kind of traveling", Henry says, leaning in the cushioned seat beside me, viewing the panorama. Maybe I must correct myself - some technologies seem to please even Henry. But than, we are forced to make a stop. A river cuts the hills in front of us, and only an old bridge connects both sides. It is obvious that we can't go on the other side with our vehicle. The bridge seems in a bad condition, only made of ragged ropes. I look in Henry's direction. "And now? What shall we do?";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201043;Crossing the Bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201043;\n\nThe ropes make noises, as we have decided to left the car behind and cross the bridge. We have shouldered our equipment. We make one step after another, looking only forward. The noises become louder. "Maybe that was not the the best idea", I suggest. Henry doesn't give an answer. His hands are trembling. His hands staring to the ropes. "The ropes! The ropes are ripping - go back, before the whole bridge collapses!" But his warnings are to late. It seems, that we have overloaded the old bridge, tearing the ropes in pieces. Yelling and cryings later, clutching the salvaging ropes with both hands, we dangle above the abyss, seeing our equipment falling in the depth of Andean valleys. We are save, hanging at the clip, but lost our equipment. An idea comes to our mind: this bridge was an Incan trap. And without our provisions we are forced to give up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201044;Lost in the Mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201044;\n\nTaking the vehicle wasn't the best thing we could do. Now, that we have been for days in the Andes, we realize that the steep and inhospitable mountains are not made for such a technology. There are no more streets we can take, and we are running out of fuel. Even our provisions are used up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201045;Peruvian Sky;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201045;\n\nIt was not easy to persuade Henry, but after hours of discussion he indulges. We take the 'Atalanta', an aircraft which the government provided us. After the take-off, Henry takes his diary, searching the bookmark in it. "Manco Capac", he notes. "The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state is searching for his remains? I didn't know that there are such optimists in the government." His voice has turned in a sarcastic mood. Henry searched the last five years for a sign of the legends associated with Manco Capac. Manco Capac, the last glorious King of the Incas. He fought the Spanish in a rebellion. He moved from Cusco to Vilcabamba and made the latter city his new capital. The last capital of the free Incan people. The discovery of Machu Picchu made many archaeologists believe, that there could be more historical sides nearby. "You should fly lower", Henry proposed, "we can't see anything." "But there is fog, and the mountains are clouded. It is too risky", I reply. But Henry is not convinced: "And what happens, if we overlook something?";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201046;The Crash;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201046;\n\nWreckages lay lounge around. The smell of fire comes from the motor. The aeroplane is battered, pieces of metal gleam in the Andean sun. I can rescue my colleague out of the wreck. Henry is unconscious, but alive. My maneuver was a bit too confident, I wasn't able to see the rough cliffs in the clouds. Our journey is over, as I decide to return to Cusco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201047;A Temple? A Temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201047;\n\nWe have won hight. The scenery becomes miniature. Henry, who was at first against this decision, suddenly seems interested. "Did you see that?" "What?" "I bet I saw a temple! Look! There! I'm sure, on this plateau", he points with his finger on the window. A temple! Henry was right. It was buried by the mountains, but here in the sky, from above, it is clearly to see. "We must land!", Henry becomes excited. "Immediately!" I see the look in his face. He is a rational and cold mind, but when it comes to an archaeological discovery, Henry changes. It seems, that he can smell this type of things. But I can't share his opinion. The plateau is not the best field to land. It is not very large, and it would cost me a lot of courage to do this bold step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201048;Temple Lost Out of Sight;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201048;\n\nI searched for a better place to land, but when I found it, it was nearly impossible to find the place where the temple was. I made a second round to rediscover the Incan monument, but it was without success. Henry made his own expedition by foot, which resulted in failure. After weeks of useless search, we gave up hope to find the temple again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201049;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201049;\n\nI was able to land 'Atalanta', despite my concerns. The aeroplane landed softly on the plateau, and Henry jumped out of the machine when the airscrew were still moving. I follow him, looking up to the temple which is in a surprising good condition. Too untouched to be true. "On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape", Henry mentions. "That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished." I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. "Any information?", I ask, but he denies. "That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201050;Breakfast with Llamas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201050;\n\nManco Capac, eh? You two are searching for the remains of the famous last Incan ruler? Follow me! A native offered his service. Now we travel through the Peruvian mountains, our equipment and ourselves carried by llamas. Henry is convinced, that a voyage with this creature, which were domesticated to reach even the most inhospitable areas of the Andes, will be more useful than the new technologies. But when I turned to him, I saw his grim face. "Henry, what is the matter?" "I don't trust this man", Henry answers. "It would be better if we buy the llamas and leave him instead. For me, he knows too much.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201051;Weren't We Here Once Before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201051;\n\nDays and weeks go by. It took this long time after I realized, that Henry was right with his assumption. This llama leader wanted to trick us. Unfortunately, it was to late. When we wanted to confront him, he escaped with the llamas. It took us days before we were able to return to Cusco, exhausted and without equipment or success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201052;Through the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201052;\n\nWithout a leader, we are shift for ourselves. The journey continues, but the problem of disorientation becomes obvious. Henry spent five years to examine Incan culture, chasing every evidence regarding the legendary capital of Manco Capac, Vilcabamba. But this area is unknown to him. Wandering through this inhabited landscape drives us to despair. No ruins. No Incan remains. Nothing. Which direction should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201053;Lost in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201053;\n\nThe blue heaven. The golden sun. Grey stones and mountains. Nothing has sense. We don't find the way to a promising archaeological place. We don't even find back home. The Andes are our grave, and maybe one day we will be found by other archaeologists, in thousands of years, making a good sample for an exhibition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201054;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201054;\n\nThe sunset brightens the sky in red colors, shining on stones. Stones of a building. On the top of a plateau, an old temple sits enthroned like an Incan god-king above the Andes. I tether the llamas, but Henry keeps going forward. "On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape", he mentions. "That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished." I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. "Any information?", I ask, but he denies. "That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201055;War Interrupts Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201055;\n\nThe communication between our expedition in Peru and our archaeological society is interrupted. Until the war goes on, our enemies will try to disturb every information exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201056;Expedition in Peru Responds Again;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201056;\n\nImmediately after the end of the war, the expedition in Peru has contacted us again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201037;Tutankhamun's Tomb Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201037;The discovery of this archaeological sensation is an international event. What should we do now, regarding the Great powers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201038;El Mirador Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201039;The Tower of Babel Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201058;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201058;\n\nWe searched for hours, but we didn't find the entrance. A huge portal marks an area, which we identify as a possible gate, but it it is closed by a huge stone slab. Knots of alpaca hair is hanging above us, corded in strange knots. "A quipu! At least something." Henry seems facilitated. The Incas wrote their messages in a complicated systems of knots, why we call them also "talking knots". Henry is able to decipher it, but his look is confused. "But... that can be true. The most quipus were conserved in the coast regions. In the mountains, nearly 90% are rotten." "Henry, please, continue the translation", I interrupt. "We have later time for these investigations." Henry grumbles, catches a breath. Than he proceeds: "Sacrifice the flesh of an animal/ the flesh of a tree/ the flesh of the sea/ and the flesh of the earth./ Finally, after five pounds of llama wool/ you will see Intis sun.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201059;The Labyrinth;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201059;\n\nWe gathered the asked goods. The are forced to give up our provisions, and I sacrifice my golden pocket watch, to fullfill the "flesh of a god" part. Lastly, we lay the llama pelts, which we took with us - fearing the cold of the night in the Andes - to the other pieces of the sacrifice, in front of the slab. "That is ridiculous", Henry delivers. "What comes next? Will Inti step down from the sky and open the door?" "Do you have a better idea?" "Maybe not a better one, but at least not so dumb like this unscientific proposal!" I want to respond, but the sound of a shattering rock breaks in. The ground trembles, shakes, and rips. The food and the wool vanish in a dark hole, together with dust and gravel. After a moment of shoke, we decide to climb down. Henry takes his rope, and after a while, we abseil in the darkness. The spark of a torch later, we stare at corridors, stairs, different floors and bizarre constructions. I never saw such an amazing compilation of dizziyng architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201060;Downstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201060;\n\nAfter a hard fall, we realize that we are caught in a pit. I grab the torch, and the dim fire lights up the space. "Henry?" "Yes?" "Why is the ground moving?" Silence follows. I lower the torch - we are surrounded by snakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201061;Upstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201061;\n\nWe reach a higher level, following a passage through a tunnel. "Something seems? similar", I notice. "What?", Henry asks - following a strange sound, like a switch, which is now activated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201062;It's a Trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201062;\n\nAHHHHHH! Our screams echoes in the labyrinth, followed by the sound of the gigantic stone ball behind us. At least, we are able to escape in a save corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201063;The Corridor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201063;\n\nReconsidering our situation, taking the corridor was a bold step. Everything seems confusing, and when we go upstairs, it seems that we go downstairs. Each step could be a trap. And there are many different routes we can chose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201064;Lost in the Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201064;\n\nRight. Left. Left. Right. Upstairs. Downstairs. Deadlock. Return. Right. Upstairs. Deadlock. Return. Return. Left. Right. Corridors, scales, floors - everywhere. I give up. We are completely lost in this strange place. There is no exit, no way out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201065;The Sanctuary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201065;\n\nA wide hall. Symbols and scenes decorate the walls. It seems, that we have left the labyrinth. We look up, to the ceiling, higher than 20 feet. Snakes, made of stone, surround a portal on the other side. He sits on a bench, a plate on his thighs - the food on it, which we "sacrificed". He is skinny and old. He notices us, but doesn't react. While he is eating, we come nearer. "Im sure, that behind this portal, there is something very important", I say to Henry. "Clearly. An old, skinny man is guarding it. Every important chambered is guarded by an old, skinny, mysterious. Hell, he lacks only a long white beard and a crusader-sword!" Henry can become very sarcastic in such situation. "And he is eating our provisions!" "Please, please... don't be so loud, my ears", the old man says as he finishes his meal. "If you calm down, I'm willing to answer your questions. This is the Temple of the Sun. A holy place. And I'm the guard of the heritage of our ancestors.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201066;The Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201066;\n\nIt's the duty of my family to protect this place, he begins. "Since generations, one man in one generation takes it on. The people from the near villages come to this sanctuary, bringing food and clothes, so I can concentrate on my service. But, times are changing. And I can't protect a culture which will die. The young people in the Andes are not interested in our past or our religion." He stands up, nodding, than he looks to us. "I know what you want. But do you really know what you want?" "Oh that is such a cliché. An old mysterious man is protecting an ancient place, all his life, and then, when - casually - two archaeologists come around, he spends time on philosophical phrases..." "Henry!" "It is true!", my colleague underlines. The old man grins. "Anyway", he begins, "what are you going to do?";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201067;Temple of the Sun Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201067;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the Sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II. Wonderful and precious artifacts were found and brought to the National Museum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201068;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the Sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II. A restricted archaeological area was arranged to prevent other people from this place. The scientists expect new and interesting information regarding the life of the Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201069;\n\nA $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the Sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II. The archaeologists agreed on to leave this place unchanged. It is viewed as a cultural and religious heritage of the local people and will be respected by $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201070;Agamemnon's Mask;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202009;Giuseppe Mazzini;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202009;\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini, was an Italian politician, journalist and activist for the unification of Italy. Mazzini was a member of the Carbonari, a secret association with political purposes. Later, he went to Marseille, where he became a popular figure to the other Italian exiles. He organized a new political society called La giovine Italia (Young Italy). It was a secret society formed to promote Italian unification. Mazzini believed that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy, and would touch off a European-wide revolutionary movement. Young Italy counted ca 60,000 adherents in 1833, with branches in Genoa and other cities. In that year Mazzini launched a first attempt of insurrection in Sardinia, which failed. He organized another uprising for the following year. A group of Italian exiles were to enter Piedmont from Switzerland and spread the revolution there, and founded a new association with German and Polish refugees, called Young Europe. Austria and Sardinia put pressure on Switzerland to extradite Mazzini.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202011;\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini, was an Italian politician, journalist and activist for the unification of Italy. Mazzini was a member of the Carbonari, a secret association with political purposes. Later, he went to Marseille, where he became a popular figure to the other Italian exiles. He organized a new political society called La giovine Italia (Young Italy). It was a secret society formed to promote Italian unification. Mazzini believed that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy, and would touch off a European-wide revolutionary movement. Young Italy counted ca 60,000 adherents in 1833, with branches in Genoa and other cities. In that year Mazzini launched a first attempt of insurrection in Sardinia, which failed. He organized another uprising for the following year. A group of Italian exiles were to enter Piedmont from Switzerland and spread the revolution there, and founded a new association with German and Polish refugees, called Young Europe. Austria and Sardinia put pressure on Switzerland to extradite him, but Mazzini was able to escape, and moved to London.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME202014;Pius IX;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202014;\n\nThe conclave of 1846, following the death of Pope Gregory XVI (1831-46), took place in an unsettled political climate within Italy. Because of this, many foreign Cardinals decided not to attend the conclave. At its start, only 46 out of 62 cardinals were present. Moreover, the conclave of 1846 was steeped in a factional division between conservatives and liberals. Faced with deadlock, liberals and moderates decided to cast their votes for Mastai-Ferretti in a move that contradicted the general mood throughout Europe. By the second day of the conclave, on 16 June 1846, during an evening ballot, Mastai-Ferretti was elected Pope. As liberal Europe applauded his election, he introduced political reforms on a broad scale. For the next twenty months after the election, Pius IX was the most popular man on the Italian peninsula, where the exclamation "Long life to Pius IX!" was often heard. His initial policies created quite a sensation among Italian patriots, both at home and in exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202033;I Promessi Sposi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202033;\n\nThe Betrothed (orig. Italian: I Promessi Sposi) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes. Set in Northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years under Spanish rule, it is sometimes seen as a veiled attack on Austria, which controlled the region at the time the novel was written. I Promessi Sposi was the first Italian historical novel, a model for subsequent Italian literary fiction and a basis for the modern Italian language. In the early 19th century, there was still some controversy as to what form the standard literary language of Italy should take. Manzoni - originally from Milan - was firmly in favor of the dialect of Florence and, after "washing his vocabulary on the banks of the Arno" (as he put it), he revised the novel's language for its republication in 1842. Many expressions, quotes and names from the novel are still commonly used in Italian, such as Perpetua or "Questo matrimonio non s'ha da fare" and it is still considered a true masterpiece of world literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202035;Il Canto degli Italiani;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202035;\n\n'Il Canto degli Italiani' (The Song of the Italians) is best known among Italians as 'Inno di Mameli' (Mameli's Hymn), after the author of the lyrics, or 'Fratelli d'Italia' (Brothers of Italy), from its opening line. The words were written in $YEAR$ in Genoa, by the then 20-year-old student and patriot Goffredo Mameli, in a climate of popular struggle for unification and independence of Italy which foreshadowed the war against Austria. The hymn enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the period of the Risorgimento and in the following decades. The hymn was also printed on leaflets in Genoa, by the printing office Casamara and published on the December 10: the demonstration was officially dedicated to the 101st anniversary of the expulsion of the Austrian powers from the city - in fact it was an excuse to protest against foreign occupations in Italy and induce Carlo Alberto to embrace the Italian cause of liberty. In this occasion the tricolor flag was shown and Mameli's hymn was publicly sung for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202038;The Legacy of Ugo Foscolo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202038;\n\nWhen Italy conquered Rome, the new nation state antagonized the Papacy and was in a permanent struggle with the Apostolic See. Italy favored secular movements and a new national spirit to encounter the strong Catholic sentiment within the country, emulating the French state. Italian artists, philosophers or scientists were promoted, and Santa Croce in Florence became an equivalent to the Pantheon in Paris. Especially personalities with secular or atheistic views were important, like the famous Italian revolutionary and poet Ugo Foscolo. Foscolo, born on Zakynthos (the Venetian Zante) in 1778 was an important figure in this new gallery of "Secular Saints", but unfortunately, Foscolo died in Chiswick, Western London, after eleven years of exile in England. In $YEAR$, Italy requested his remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202040;The Foscolo crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202040;\n\nThese mint-sauce-smelling British bastards, these sons of a one-leg cow - they won't give us Foscolo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202041;Foscolo returns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202041;\n\nIn $YEAR$, Foscolo's remains were brought to Florence, at the request of Italy, and with all the pride, pomp and circumstance of a great national mourning, found their final resting-place beside the monuments of Machiavelli and Alfieri, of Michelangelo and Galileo, in the church of Santa Croce, the pantheon of Italian glory he had celebrated in Dei sepolcri. Long live Italy, long live the United Kingdom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202042;First wireless transatlantic transmission;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202042;\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began investigating the means to signal completely across the Atlantic, in order to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, Co. Wexford in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall and Clifden in Co. Galway. He soon made the announcement that on 12 December 1901, using a 152.4-meter (500 ft) kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at Signal Hill in Saint John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada) signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. In $YEAR$, Marconi built a station near South Wellfleet, Massachusetts that sent a message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202046;Macchi M.C.72;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202046;\n\nThe Macchi M.C. 72 was an experimental seaplane designed and built by the Italian aircraft company Macchi Aeronautica. The M.C. 72 was built in 1931 with the idea of competing for what turned out to be the final Schneider Trophy race, but due to engine problems, the M.C. 72 was unable to compete. For two years, the M.C. 72 suffered from many mechanical defects, as well as the loss of two test pilots who died trying to coax world class speed out of the M.C. 72. The aircraft finally lived up to expectations when it set a new world speed record on 10 April 1933, with a speed of 682 km/h. Not satisfied, development continued as the aircraft's designers thought they could break 700 km/h with the M.C. 72. This feat was in fact achieved on 23 October 1934, when Agello piloted the M.C. 72 for an average speed of 709 km/h over three passes. The M.C. 72 held the world speed record for all aircraft for five years and remained the fastest speed ever attained by a piston-engine seaplane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202047;A visit in Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202047;\n\nIn $YEAR$, the Emperor and the Empress of Austria visited Venice. The city was still aware of its lost independence, and nationalistic movements were around. In fact, the windows were locked and the streets empty. The Serenissima prepared a cold reception. Franz Joseph mentioned later, that the silence "killed more than a bullet".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202048;Saint Mark's Campanile;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202048;\n\nSaint Mark's Campanile (Campanile di San Marco in Italian) is the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, located in the Piazza San Marco. It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city. In July 1902, the north wall of the tower began to show signs of a dangerous crack that in the following days continued to grow. Finally, on Monday, July 14, around 9:45 am, the campanile collapsed completely, also demolishing the logetta. Remarkably, no one was killed, except for the caretaker's cat. Because of the campanile's position, the resulting damage was relatively limited. Apart from the logetta, only a corner of the Biblioteca Marciana was destroyed. The pietra del bando, a large porphyry column from which laws used to be read, protected the basilica itself. Nevertheless, the loss of one of the greatest symbols of old italian culture was discuessed in the whole nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202049;The Death of Leopardi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202049;\n\nGiacomo Leopardi was an Italian poet, essayist, philosopher, and philologist. Although he lived in a secluded town in the ultra-conservative Papal States, he came in touch with the main thoughts of the Enlightenment, and, by his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. Leopardi often wrote about poetry in general and about his own idea of poetry, of its language and scope. Many pages on this subject can be found in the Zibaldone, a private diary and collection of notes, literary projects, translations, etc. Together with Alessandro Manzoni, Leopardi had an immense impact on the Italian language and was one figurehead of patriotic and nationalistic movements in Italy. The greatest poet of the Italian Romanticism died at 38 years in Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202050;Giosuè Carducci;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202050;\n\nGiosuè Carducci, born 1835 in Valdicastello (Lucca), was an Italian poet and teacher. He was very influential and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy, being a part of the general cultural and political life. Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. His political views were consistently opposed to Christianity generally and the secular power of the Catholic Church in particular. This anti-clerical revolutionary zeal is prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative 'Inno a Satana' (Hymn to Satan). While 'Inno a Satana' had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years. His collections Rime Nuove (New Rhymes) and Odi Barbare (Barbarian Odes) contain his greatest works. Carducci also translated some works  of Goethe and Heine into Italian. One year before his death, Carducci became the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202052;Gabriele D'Annunzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202052;\n\nGabriele D'Annunzio was an Italian writer, poet, journalist, playwright and soldier. He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature and political life. He was nicknamed Il Vate (The Poet) and Il Profeta (The Prophet). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism. At the height of his success, D'Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing and his work had immense impact across Europe and on generations of Italian writers. He came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. In 1897 D'Annunzio was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he sat as an independent. He collaborated with Debussy, Mascagni, Marinetti and took a flight with Wilbur Wright, becoming a pilot himself and a hero in air-battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202053;La Conoscienza di Svevo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202053;\n\nAron Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo, was an Italian writer and businessman, author of novels, plays, and short stories. Italo Svevo (literally Italian Swabian) wrote the classic novel La Coscienza di Zeno (rendered as Confessions of Zeno, or Zeno's Conscience) and self-published it in 1923. The work, showing the author's interest in the theories of Sigmund Freud, is written in the form of the memoirs of one Zeno Cosini, who writes them at the insistence of his psychoanalyst. Schmitz's novel received almost no attention from Italian readers and critics at the time. The work might have disappeared altogether if it were not for the efforts of James Joyce. Joyce had met Svevo in 1907, when Joyce tutored him in English while working for Berlitz in Trieste. Joyce championed Confessions of Zeno, helping to have it translated into French and then published in Paris, where critics praised it extravagantly. That led Italian critics to discover it. Svevo was also a model for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Joyce's Ulysses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202054;Gioachino Rossini;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202054;\n\nGioachino Antonio Rossini was an Italian composer who wrote 39 operas as well as sacred music, chamber music, songs, and some instrumental and piano pieces. His best-known operas include the Italian comedies Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville) and La Cenerentola and the French-language epics Moïse et Pharaon and Guillaume Tell. A tendency for inspired, song-like melodies is evident throughout his scores, which led to the nickname "The Italian Mozart". Until his retirement in 1829, Rossini had been the most popular opera composer in history. He returned to the Papal States, namely Bologna, where he became director of music, spending his time by composing chamber and sacred music.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202055;Donizetti's Caterina Cornaro;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202055;\n\nGaetano Donizetti was an Italian composer from Bergamo, Lombardy. Along with Vincenzo Bellini and Gioachino Rossini, he was a leading composer of bel canto opera. Following the success of Linda di Chamounix, Caterina Cornaro was commissioned by Bartolomeo Merelli, impresario of the Kaertnerthortheater in Vienna, and was partly composed in 1842/1843. The Viennese realized that the same subject had been set to music the preceding year by Franz Lachner and the debut was canceled. Two months after the triumph of Dom Sébastien in Paris, Caterina was booed at the San Carlo in Naples. The composer, who had been unable to be present at rehearsals or to oversee the orchestration, had clearly predicted the opera's failure: "I am anxiously awaiting news of the fiasco of Caterina Cornaro in Naples. La Goldberg as a primadonna is my first disaster without knowing it. I wrote for a soprano, they give me a mezzo! God knows if Coletti, if Fraschini intend their roles as I intend them. God knows what a catastrophe censorship has brought.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202056;Cavalleria rusticana;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202056;\n\nCavalleria rusticana (Rustic Chivalry) is an opera in one act by Pietro Mascagni to an Italian libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti and Guido Menasci, and considered one of the classic verismo operas. Although Mascagni had started writing two other operas earlier (Pinotta, premiered in 1932 and Guglielmo Ratcliff, premiered in 1895), Cavalleria rusticana was his first opera to be completed and performed. It remains the best known of his fifteen operas and one operetta. Its success has been phenomenal from its first performance in the Teatro Costanzi in Rome until the present day. At the time of Mascagni's death in 1945, the opera had been performed more than 14,000 times in Italy alone. The first performance of Cavalleria rusticana caused a sensation, with Mascagni taking 40 curtain calls on the opening night, and winning the First Prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202057;Fountains of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202057;\n\nOttorino Respighi was an Italian composer, musicologist and conductor. His musicological interest in 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century music led him to also compose pieces based on the music of this period. He also wrote a number of operas, the best known being La fiamma. He is best known for his orchestral "Roman trilogy": Fountains of Rome (Le fontane di Roma), Pines of Rome (I pini di Roma), and Roman Festivals (Feste romane). Fountains of Rome is a symphonic poem, separated in four sections, depicting one of Rome's fountains during different periods of the day and night. Although the premiere in Rome was unsuccessful, Arturo Toscanini finally conducted the work in Milan in 1918 with tremendous success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202058;Nessun dorma?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202058;\n\nGiacomo Puccini was an Italian composer whose operas are among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire and considered the greatest Italian composer of opera after Verdi. While his early work was rooted in traditional late-19th century romantic Italian opera, he successfully developed his work in the "realistic" verismo style, of which he became one of the leading exponents. Turandot, Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished, and the last two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer's sketches. The libretto for Turandot was based on a play by Carlo Gozzi, also called Turandot. The music of the opera is heavily inflected with pentatonic motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavor to the music. Unlike La Fanciulla, Turandot contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them Nessun dorma. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202059;Aida;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202059;\n\nAida is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on a scenario often attributed to French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, although it has been argued that the scenario was actually written by Temistocle Solera. Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write the opera for performance in January $YEAR$, paying him 150,000 francs, but the premiere was delayed. Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo on 24 December $YEAR$. The costumes and accessories for the premiere were designed by Auguste Mariette, and he oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were created in Paris and shipped to Cairo. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, Milan, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202061;Rigoletto;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202061;\n\nRigoletto is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The Italian libretto was written on the play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo. It was first performed at La Fenice in Venice in $YEAR$. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over Northern Italian theaters at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere and is considered by many to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career, being the first of his three "Popular" operas (Il Trovatore and La Traviata conclude the trilogy). Rigoletto premiered to a sold out La Fenice and was a complete triumph, especially the scena drammatica, and the Duke's cynical aria, 'La donna è mobile' which was sung in the streets the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202063;The Requiem;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202063;\n\nOn 22 May 1873, the Italian writer and humanist Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi had admired all his adult life and met in 1868, died. Upon hearing of his death, Verdi resolved to complete a Requiem for the most important Italian writer of the 19th century. The Requiem was first performed in the church of San Marco in Milan and three days later at the Scala. Verdi conducted himself. It won immediate contemporary success, and became a national celebration of arts, as two of the greatest cultural personalities of Italy - one in the field of music, one in the field of literature - merged together in an allegory of artistic spirit. As to the music qua music, the critical consensus agreed that the work displayed "fluent invention, beautiful sound effects and charming vocal writing." Critics were divided between praise and condemnation with respect to Verdi's willingness to break standard compositional rules for musical effect, such as his use of consecutive fifths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202065;Restaurazione;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202065;\n\nFollowing the defeat of Napoleonic France, the Congress of Vienna was convened to redraw the European continent. In Italy, the Congress restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments, either directly ruled or strongly influenced by the prevailing European powers, particularly Austria, since the Empire directly controlled the predominantly Italian-speaking northeastern part of present-day Italy and were, together, the most powerful force against unification. The Austrian Empire vigorously repressed nationalist sentiment growing on the Italian peninsula, as well as in the other parts of Habsburg domains. The Austrian diplomat von Metternich stated that the word Italy was nothing more than "a geographic expression". One of the most influential revolutionary groups was the Carbonari, a secret organization formed in Southern Italy. Artistic and literary sentiment also turned towards nationalism, provoking a climate, in which the Resurgence of Italy would occur: The Risorgimento.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200001;Der Dom zu Köln;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200001;\n\nRomantic sentiment and evolving nationalistic spirit of our people have evoked a high interest in the medieval age, which is seen as the root of the German culture. A symbol of these far away and backward times are the cathedrals of gothic architectural style. Cologne, once the biggest German city, and one of the finest places in the times of the Holy Roman Empire, has one of the greatest cathedrals in human history - which is a large, abandoned construction area. Founded in the 13th century, the building work was suspended in the 1530s. Even the old construction crane is there above! Since 1814, when the construction plans were found again by Georg Moller in Darmstadt, there were several voices to revive the work of our ancestors - and new founded societies have argued, that this project should not be only a private intention. Maybe we should give state support, and finish this great gothic masterpiece, in the name of the German nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME200005;The German Anthem;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200005;\n\nA debate is held in the parliament of our newborn nation. Nationalists, liberals, monarchists and conservatives argued in an open tumoil regarding the new anthem of Germany. Several songs were nominated, but each has a different meaning for different political groups. Intellectuals are convinced, that the new anthem will have a heavy influence on our people, and will be a symbol of Germany in the world. The struggle between monarchists and liberals was settled by some moderate conservatives, who proposed other suggestions for the anthem. In the end, we have now four nominations, the first proposed by the monarchists, the second by the liberals, and the other two as a way to strike a balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME200008;The Göttinger Seven;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200008;\n\nImmediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the new King Ernest August dissolved the parliament which had been convened under the disputed constitution. He proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the ground that his consent had not been asked, and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs. The King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored. In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at Göttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths, and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions, and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover. However, he was widely criticized in other parts of Germany and Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200011;The Famous Göttinger Seven;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200011;\n\nRemember our heroes! Remember the Göttinger Seven! Praise their virtues! When Professor Dahlmann published his documents against the King of Hanover, it received popular support by German students and liberals. It had an explosive influence in the German states of the German Confederation. The students at the University of Göttingen produced many hundreds, or even thousands, of copies and disseminated them across Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200012;The Göttinger Seven Seek Refuge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200012;\n\nHistory shows us noble and free men, who dared to say the full truth in the face of the King. The permission has one, who has courage. After their struggle in Hanover, some of the Göttinger Seven searched a new university where they could continue their work, namely Dahlmann, Gervinus and Jacob Grimm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200014;Vormärz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200014;\n\nIn $YEAR$, the states of the German Confederation were in the middle of the so-called 'Vormärz' (pre-March). The name derived from the later (failed) revolution in the March of 1848, and was a period which was shaped by the Austrian and Prussian police states, the censorship of the press and restricted freedoms. But it was also the time of German romanticism, evolving nationalism and great personalities, which made Germany to the land of poets and thinkers. German culture blossomed, intellectuals stood up against reactionary governments, and such ideas as national unity and wider suffrage became topics of a new liberal and democratic movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200015;The Kneeling Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200015;\n\nTraditionally, Bavaria was a catholic state. But with the foundation of the kingdom and the annexations of surrounding lands in the Napoleonic age, Bavaria gained large territories which were protestant. In this time, the king promoted a more tolerant politic toward his subjects. An example was the edict, that protestant soldiers had not to knee in front of a Catholic mass or procession. However, Minister Karl von Abel has proposed to change this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200016;The Era Blittersdorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200016;\n\nBaden was one of the most liberal states in the German Confederation. However, in the late 1830s and beginning 1840s, minister Friedrich von Blittersdorf went against the liberal and democratic traditions of Baden. He promoted monarchic traditions, which lead to much discontent among the liberal society of this south German country. Especially the bureaucrats and officials were upset by his reactionary politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200019;Deutsches Wörterbuch;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200019;\n\nDas Deutsche Wörterbuch (The German Dictionary) is one of the most important dictionaries of the German language. It is for German what the Oxford English Dictionary is for English, containing detailed historical information about the origin and use over time of German words, with examples taken from actual documents. In German the dictionary is also known as "Der Grimm". It was started by the Grimm brothers (known also for Grimms' Fairy Tales) in 1838. Initially the Grimm brothers expected the project to take ten years and produce 6-7 volumes. In fact, the first volume was not published until 1854. Wilhelm Grimm died in 1859, and Jacob in 1863, while working on the entry for 'Frucht' (fruit). After their deaths multiple institutions were involved in the work, including the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Berlin Academy, with a center in Goettingen also involved. Finally completed in 1961, the dictionary will contain 32 volumes and include about 350,000 main entries. The "Grimm" was not only a scientific, but also national work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200021;Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200021;\n\nIn 1843, the German poet Heinrich Heine, who left Germany 1831 for France, went back for a few weeks, visiting his mother and publisher Julius Campe in Hamburg. Heine was not a typical romantic author, but more a satirical one who criticized the reactionary policy and censorship of the authoritarian German states, but also his nationalistic and chauvinistic compatriots. On the return journey to Paris, the first draft of 'Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen' (Germany: A Winter's Tale) took shape. The verse epic appeared in 1844 published by Hoffmann and Campe, Hamburg. According to the censorship regulations of the Carlsbad Conference of 1819, manuscripts of more than twenty folios did not fall under the scrutiny of the censor. Therefore it was published together with other poems in a volume called 'New Poems'. The work showed Heine's world of images and his folk-song-like poetic diction in a compact gathering, with cutting, ironic criticisms of the circumstances in his homeland. Heine's verse-epic was much debated in Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200029;Germanistentag 1846;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200029;\n\nIn 1846, a conference of German historians, philologists and lawyers was held in Frankfurt. German history, law and language were debated topics, but also political issues like the question regarding a national state. Some of the prominent personalities at this remarkable meeting of German thinkers were Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, Georg Waitz and Johann Gustav Droysen. The venue was the old townhall of Frankfurt, the 'Römer'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC200031;\n\nIn 1847, a conference of German historians, philologists and lawyers was held in Frankfurt. 170 academics under the leadership of Jacob Grimm debated on history, law and language, but also political issues. The conference was described as an "intellectual assembly of the German people". On the last day, when a banquet was held in the old town hall of Lubeck, Heinrich Carl Jaup demanded a general citizenship as a first step towards a unified nation state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200034;The Constitutional Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200034;\n\nLike Baden, Hesse-Kassel had a rather liberal constitution. But after the liberal revolution, Elector Friedrich Wilhelm assigned a reactionary government and conducted an unpopular policy against the traditional liberties. The most radical step were his decrees, which were against the constitution. A conflict between the elector and the parliament evolved, ending in the suspension of the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200035;Humboldt's Kosmos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200035;\n\nKosmos (usually referred to in English as 'Cosmos') was an influential treatise on science and nature written by the German scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. Kosmos began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the University of Berlin, and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and incomplete). Widely read by academics and laymen alike, it applied the ancient Greek view of the orderliness of the cosmos (the universe) to the Earth, suggesting that universal laws applied as well to the apparent chaos of the terrestrial world. Controversially for the time, Humboldt in Kosmos spoke of the spirituality of the natural world only in general terms, avoiding the notion of a creator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200036;Robert Schumann;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200036;\n\nRobert Schumann is regarded as one of the most representative composers of the Romantic era. In 1850, he succeeded Ferdinand Hiller as musical director and moved to Düsseldorf. Although criticized regarding his poor conductor skills and scoffed because of his "creative decay", Schumann composed his last symphony, the 'Rhenish'. He used Beethoven's and Mendelssohn's symphonies as a model, but was also inspired by his impressions of the Rhineland. Schumann himself stated, that his journey to Cologne and the sight of the cathedral were his main inspiration for this composition, which became one of his most famous works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200037;Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200037;\n\nFelix Mendelssohn Bartholdy was a German composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early Romantic period. Early success in Germany, where he also revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, was followed by travel throughout Europe. His essentially conservative musical tastes, however, set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theater Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook. His Violin Concerto was his last large orchestral work and is one of the most popular and most frequently performed violin concertos of all time. The concerto was first performed in Leipzig on 13 March 1845 with Ferdinand David as soloist. Mendelssohn was unable to conduct due to illness and the premiere was conducted by the Danish composer Niels Gade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200038;Franz Liszt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200038;\n\nFranz Liszt became renowned in Europe during the nineteenth century for his virtuosic skill as a pianist. He was said by his contemporaries to have been the most technically advanced pianist of his age. In the 1840s he was considered by some to be perhaps the greatest pianist of all time. He was also a well-known composer, piano teacher, and conductor. He was a benefactor to other composers, including Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg and Alexander Borodin. He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work in which he influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated some 20th-century ideas and trends. When Liszt took up a long-standing invitation of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia to settle at Weimar, the most important period of his creative work began. Liszt had ample time to compose and during the next 12 years revised or produced those orchestral and choral pieces upon which his reputation as a composer mainly rested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200039;Johannes Brahms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200039;\n\nJohannes Brahms was a German composer and pianist, and one of the leading musicians of the Romantic period. Born in Hamburg, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna, Austria, where he was a leader of the musical scene. In his lifetime, Brahms's popularity and influence were considerable. Following a comment by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow, he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the Three Bs. Brahms composed for piano, chamber ensembles, symphony orchestra, and for voice and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works and worked with some of the leading performers of his time. It was the premiere of A German Requiem, his largest choral work, in Bremen, in 1868, that confirmed Brahms's European reputation and led many to accept that he had conquered Beethoven and the symphony. This gave him the confidence finally to complete a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200040;Schubert's 'Unfinished';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200040;\n\nFranz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B minor, commonly known as the 'Unfinished Symphony' (German: Unvollendete), was started in 1822 but left with only two movements known to be complete, even though Schubert would live for another six years. After his death, the work fell into oblivion, until Johann von Herbeck found it in the possession of Schubert's friend Anselm Hüttenbrenner in 1865. Herbeck conducted the symphony in the same year, and the performance was met with great enthusiasm by the audience. The work is often referred to as Schubert’s first romantic symphony owing to its emphasis on expressive melody, vivid harmony, and creative combinations of orchestral tone color. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200041;Johann Strauss;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200041;\n\nJohann Strauss was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely then responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include The Blue Danube, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known. The operetta 'Die Fledermaus' premiered on 5 April 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, and has been part of the regular operetta repertoire ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200042;Gustav Mahler;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200042;\n\nGustav Mahler was a late-Romantic Austrian composer and one of the leading conductors of his generation. As a composer, he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). His innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner and Mozart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200043;Richard Strauss;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200043;\n\nRichard Georg Strauss was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include Der Rosenkavalier and Salome, his Lieder - especially his Four Last Songs - and his tone poems and other orchestral works, such as Death and Transfiguration, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, Also sprach Zarathustra, An Alpine Symphony, and Metamorphosen. Strauss was also a prominent conductor throughout Germany and Austria. Strauss, along with Gustav Mahler, represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Richard Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. In 1905, Strauss produced Salome, a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the play by Oscar Wilde, in 1909 followed Elektra. Both were performed in Dresden for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200044;Anton Bruckner;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200044;\n\nAnton Bruckner was an Austrian composer known for his symphonies, masses, and motets. The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies. Unlike other musical radicals, such as Richard Wagner or Hugo Wolf who fit the enfant terrible mould, Bruckner showed extreme humility before other musicians, Wagner in particular. The apparent dichotomy between Bruckner the man and Bruckner the composer hampers efforts to describe his life in a way that gives a straightforward context for his music. His works, the symphonies in particular, had detractors, most notably the influential Austrian critic Eduard Hanslick, and other supporters of Johannes Brahms. He died in 1896.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200045;Arnold Schönberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200045;\n\nArnold Schönberg was an Austrian composer and painter, associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. In the 1920s, Schönberg developed the twelve-tone technique, a widely influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation, and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea. Schönberg was also a painter, an important music theorist, and an influential teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200046;Mondnacht;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200046;\n\nJoseph Freiherr von Eichendorff was a German poet and novelist of the later German romantic school. Eichendorff's guiding poetic theme was that Man should find happiness in full absorption of the beauties and changing moods of Nature. The lyricism of Eichendorff's poetry is much praised, and his poems have been set by many composers, including Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hans Pfitzner, and Alexander Zemlinsky. In 1837, his poem 'Mondnacht' (Night of the Moon) was published, which is often seen as the "pearl of pearls" of German romantic lyricism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200047;Carl Spitzweg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200047;\n\nCarl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. In 1839, his first painting 'The Poor Poet' was published. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200049;The Weavers of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200049;\n\nIn $PROVINCENAME$, social, economical and political problems are evident. Upcoming liberal ideals and emerging poverty among the traditional artisans have created a menacing conflict situation. Rumors do the rounds, that a rebellion will take place, headed by the local weavers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME200050;Weavers’ Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200050;\n\nIn $YEAR$, an uprising of weavers took place in $COUNTRY$. The revolt was crushed by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military, but was closely observed by the German society and treated by several artists, among them Heinrich Heine (poem Die armen Weber). It was seen as a symbol of the unsettled problems in Germany, regarding political and social reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200051;\n\nIn $YEAR$, an uprising of weavers took place in $FROMCOUNTRY$.

EVTNAME200052;The Weavers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200052;\n\nIn $YEAR$, Gerhart Hauptmann's play The Weavers was first performed. Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period, as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions, the play has no true central character, providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting. Instead of a hero, Hauptmann created a mob. This mob is therefore the protagonist - or chief character - and if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long. The historical background was the Weavers' Uprising in the 1840s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME500001;The Polish Uprising of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC500001;\n\nAfter our country was came out of the latest war, our subjects in Congress Poland and other parts of our empire are getting restless. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army. It was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. In Vilnius alone 116 demonstrations were held in $YEAR$. Much of these manifestations in Vilnius ended in clashes with the Imperial Russian Army. In spite of Russian police and Cossack interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across Niemen River. The crowds sang "God protect Poland" in Lithuanian and Belarusian. Earlier in $YEAR$ Russians had introduced a state of emergency in Vilna Governorate, Kovno Governorate and Grodno Governorate. Public gatherings were banned and some public leaders were declared outlaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME500002;The Polish Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC500002;\n\nPolish subjects of $FROMCOUNTRY$, together with some other nationalities in the territory of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, started a general uprising against $FROMCOUNTRY$.

EVTDESC500003;\n\nTraugutt, the insurrection general, and the four other members of the Polish Government were apprehended by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ troops and executed at the Warsaw citadel. The war in the course of which 650 battles and skirmishes were fought and twenty-five thousand Polish killed, came to a speedy end in $YEAR$. The tzar passed laws and edicts to make the land an integral part of Russia's territory and decided how to deal with the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188128;Christ of Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188128;\n\nRomantic Slavic messianism held the idea that the Slavs (or specific nations such as Poland) are being crucified so that other European nations may eventually be redeemed. The image of Poland as the Christ of Europe was first evoked by Adam Mickiewicz in his tragic poetical play Dziady (1832), written in the aftermath of the country's unsuccessful 1830 uprising against the Russian Empire, considered by some to be one of the great works of European romanticism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188128;Interesting idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188129;Greater Poland Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188129;King Frederick William IV of Prussia amnestied the Polish prisoners, who found a 'Polish Legion', and were armed with weapons from the Royal Prussian Arsenal. Speeches during the demonstration were made about joint fight against Russian Empire to free Congress Poland. Inspired by the events in Berlin, a demonstration in Poznañ was organized and the authorities agreed to creation of delegation that would bring proposals of Polish side to Berlin and to the Prussian King. A Polish National Committee, dominated by conservatives and liberals, was formed. Armed peasants and townspeople attacked Prussian administrative offices and clashed with troops. Meanwhile, the National Committee, which would have been satisfied with autonomy for the duchy, entered into negotiations with the Prussian authorities, counting on concessions from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188130;Galician Administration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188130;\n\nAfter the Ausgleich, representatives of the Polish aristocracy and intelligentsia addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of Austria-Hungary with Polish and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or Ruthenian, as official languages. The Germanisation had been halted and the censorship lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the Galicia Diet and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188131;Frédéric Chopin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188131;\n\nFrédéric François Chopin, a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist, died today in Paris. He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of this era, whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation." Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed many of his works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London's Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of Polish refugees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188132;The Hungarian Diet of 1839-40;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188132;\n\nThe alarm of the popularity of the Liberal party induced it, soon after the accession of the new emperor Ferdinand I., to attempt to crush the Hungarian reform movement by arresting and imprisoning the most active agitators among them, Lajos Kossuth and Miklós Wesselényi. The Diet of 1839-40 refused to proceed to business till the political prisoners had been released, and, while in the Lower Chamber the reforming majority was larger than ever, a Liberal party was now also formed in the Upper House. Among the positive steps taken by the Diet of 1839-40 was the new urbarial law permitting individual serfs, as well as entire communities, to pay a fixed sum as manumission compensation, thus opening the way for serfs to become free landowners. The Diet also acted to safeguard the free development of industrial enterprises and to limit child labor and decided to prepare a new penal code on the basis of the best available foreign sources, including American.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188133;The Hungarian Diet of 1843-44;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188133;\n\nAlternately resisting and yielding to the pressures of clashing linguistic nationalisms, the Austrian authorities were less willing to make concessions in the economic sphere. Both chambers of the Diet of 1843-44 jointly requested the modification of internal tariffs separating Hungary from the rest of the Habsburg lands. This plea, of concern to liberals and conservatives alike, received only evasive answer. Indignantly, the predominantly liberal Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution supporting the recently founded National Protective Association. This group sought to exlude Austrian manufactures from Hungary under the slogan "Buy Hungarian!" The new association elected as its director Kossuth, who had recently been forced out of the editorship of the newspaper called Pesti Hirlap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188134;The Hungarian Reform Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188134;\n\nIn the 1820s, the Emperor Francis I was forced to convene the Hungarian Diet, and thus a Reform Period ensued. Nevertheless, its progress was slow, because the nobles insisted on retaining their privileges. Count István Széchenyi, the most prominent statesmen of the country, recognized the urgent need for modernization and his message was taken to heart by other Hungarian political leaders, such as Ferenc Deák and Lajos Kossuth. A liberal party emerged in the Diet that focused on providing for the peasantry in mostly symbolic ways because of their ability to understand the needs of the laborers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA188134;Worrying news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188135;The Hungarian Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188135;\n\nWhen news of the uprisings in Europe reached Hungary, Lajos Kossuth made a speech to demand a parliamentary government for Hungary, further encouraging the young radical liberals to do more than just talk about insurrection. In the following days, these dissidents wrote a list of 12 Points demanding comprehensive democratic rights (such as freedom of the press and the liberation of political prisoners), while poet Sándor Petõfi composed his poetic masterpiece, the 'National Song'. Revolutionaries marched into the streets of Budapest to visit various plazas and loudly recite their 12 Points, gathering a fast-growing crowd of sympathizers to join their movement. Before long, thousands of fired-up Budapest citizens were parading through the city, defying censorship by seizing the presses to print and distribute the 12 Points. The crowd crossed the Danube to Buda to rally in front of the Habsburg governing council, where the emperor's representatives fearfully agreed to enact the 12 Points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188136;Maritime and Colonial League;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188136;\n\nIn $YEAR$, Poland signed an agreement called the 'Treaty of Friendship' with Liberia. Poland obtained the status of the "most privileged state" and facilitated access to farmland and raw materials in Liberia. According to one of Makarczyk's later accounts, the treaty was also supposed to include a secret clause that allowed the League to recruit up to 100,000 Liberians to the Polish Army in case of war. The League was planning to promote a large-scale Polish settlement in Liberia. A group of Polish pioneers boarded the vessel S.S. Poznañ, which took them from Gdynia to Monrovia. Polish farms were established in Liberia but did not bring large profits due to small investments flowing in from Poland. With time, Liberia became frightened by reckless articles in the Polish press that labeled the Black Republic as practically a Polish colony. In addition, the American press launched an anti-Polish campaign, perhaps inspired by the large corporation Firestone with interests in Liberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Then he invaded Hungary to dissolve the Hungarian Government, without any order by the Austrian throne.

From 1855 to 1857, Pels Rijcken was assigned as commandant of the Nagasaki Naval Training Center, teaching the principles of a modern naval science to samurai including Katsu Kaishu. He arrived as captain of the Gedeh which accompanied the steam warship, the ZM SS Soembing, a gift from King William III of the Netherlands to Shogun Tokugawa Iesada. Under the name of Kanko Maru, Soembing was used at the Nagasaki Naval Training Center as a training vessel. While in Japan, he was promoted to commander in May 1856. He was succeeded in this post by Willem Huyssen van Kattendijke from 1857 and returned to the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188153;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Applies For Statehood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188153;Yesterday morning we received a petition from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, requesting statehood in the Caribbean Federation. A state constitution has been submitted, along with maps defining the state's territorial boundaries. Common opinion seems to hold it a forgone conclusion that we will accept this petition for statehood and forever join $FROMCOUNTRY$ into our prosperous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188155;Ultimatum to Serbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188155;With results of the investigation clearly showing direct intervention of the Serbian state into the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as an attempt to destabilize our Empire, it is now time to show Serbia that $COUNTRY$ will respond to all attempts aimed against our territorial integrity with overwhelming force. But in order to satisfy the public and bring blame of the starting war upon Serbia, we have compiled a series of unacceptable demands to the Serbian government, which will be surely rejected, serving as a good pretext for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203925;Bear Flag Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203925;The illegal American migrants have grown discontent with their lack of legal rights and representation. After hearing the news of our war with America, the settlers in California started a revolt, claiming the independence of their so called Californian Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202015;The Roman Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202015;\n\nThe Pope's first act of a general amnesty for political prisoners did not consider its potential implications and consequences. The freed revolutionaries merely resumed their previous activities, and his concessions only provoked greater demands. Patriotic Italian groups now sought not only a constitutional government, which he was sympathetic to, but also the Unification of Italy under his leadership and a war of liberation against Catholic Austria which claimed the Northern Italian provinces as its own. By early $YEAR$, all of Western Europe began to be convulsed in various revolutionary movements. The Pope, claiming to be above national interests, refused to go to war with Austria, which totally reversed the hitherto popular view of him in his native Italy. In a calculated, well-prepared move, Prime Minister Rossi was assassinated, and in the days following, the Swiss Guards were disarmed, making the Pope a prisoner in his palace. A Roman Republic was declared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202017;Pius IX Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202017;\n\nAfter a month-long siege, the army of the Roman Republic, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, has accepted the truce offer given to them and withdrawn from Rome for refuge in the neutral Republic of San Marino. Thus, the French Army has entered Rome and re-established the Holy See's power, putting an end to the republican government. The French monarch has issued a sort of manifesto in which he asked of Pius IX a general amnesty, a secularized administration, the establishment of the French legal code, and in general a liberal government. However the Pope will take his time before returning to Rome itself, as the French are considered liberals all the same, and the Pope refuses to return until he is assured of no French meddling in his affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202016;The Roman Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202016;Following the assassination of his prime minister in $YEAR$, Pope Pius IX fled Rome and took refuge in the Kingdom of Naples. Giuseppe Mazzini and colleagues proclaimed the end of papal power and prepared a modern constitution for the newly announced Roman Republic. Giuseppe Garibaldi joined them to organize its defense. From his fortress at Gaeta, Pius IX called on the Catholic powers of Europe to send their armies to restore him to power. We should help the Pope to win the support of the Catholics in our country--and to keep Austria out of the Papal State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME203926;California Trail;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC203926;Since the past few years, more and more American settlers have arrived to California, hoping for a better life or to try their luck--acting on rumors spreading that the mountains of California are full of gold. Some of our generals, however, believe this could be a sign of an upcoming American invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202000;The Five Days of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202000;\n\nMilan, capital of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and our most important foothold in Italy is occupied by rebells! Italian patriots have observed the ongoing unrest in our country and drove our garrisons out of the city. Popular uprisings are spreading in our Italian depencies, building barricades, raising flags with the Italian tricolore, and shouting their battlecry for an unified Italy. After five days, the last Austrian soldiers had to draw back. Our men fought bravely, but we had no chance--these rude traitors are now in complete control of the capital of Lombardy, celebrating these "Five Days of Milan". This may be the beginning of a dangerous turn in our Italian politics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202001;A Sardinian Intervention?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202001;\n\nIn $YEAR$ revolutionary riots broke out in numerous places of Italy, as well in many other parts of Europe. Charles Albert in Piedmont had been forced to make concessions to the democrats. With Vienna itself in revolt, both Milan and Venice, the main cities of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, under Austrian rule, revolted. The situation was favorable for Sardinia, which would see the full support of the Lombard patriots in Milan, if they intervened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202002;The Italian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202002;\n\nIn $YEAR$ revolutionary riots broke out in numerous places of Italy, as well in many other parts of Europe. Charles Albert in Piedmont had been forced to make concessions to the democrats. With Vienna itself in revolt, both Milan and Venice, the main cities of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, under Austrian rule, revolted. The situation was favorable for Sardinia, which would see the full support of the Lombard patriots in Milan. The Kingdom decided to exploit the moment and attacked the weakened Austria within her Italian territories. After a plebiscite, Milan was annexed by Sardinia, and a combined army beat the Austrians at Pastrengo. The War of Italian Independence had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202003;The Fall of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202003;\n\nThe fall of Milan was a huge blow for the Piedmontese army. The way to Turin laid open, and the Austrian forces were newly organized. Sardinia was in a very delicate situation and feared more consequences if the Austrians advanced. The King went so far that he proposed to abdicate and return the provinces in Lombardy to Austria in return for a status quo ante.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202004;Austria wins the Italian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202004;\n\nThe Sardinian ambitions ended in a crushing defeat. The King of Sardinia abdicated, Milan returned under rightful Austrian rule, and a peace treaty was made. The failure of nationalistic forces was a huge setback for a union of Italian states--a glorious day for Austria!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202005;The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202005;\n\nA delegation of Italian nationalists, led by a man called Daniele Manin, has petitioned the congregation of Venetia regarding a "constitution", "independence of the Italian Kingdom", and other trifles related to liberalism and democracy. Such ideas are rising in the Italian provinces. Cultural life in Milan and Venetia is full of propaganda against the government, and it seems Italian insolence has reached a new peak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202006;Repubblica di San Marco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202006;\n\nAfter existing as an independent maritime republic for 1000 years and a leading naval power in the Mediterranean for most of that time, Venice surrendered to Napoleon during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1797 and was ceded to the Austrian Empire (as the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia) by the Treaty of Campo Formio a few months later. Austrian rule, after realizing that mutually-agreeable home rule would not be possible, exploited Venetian resources, economically and politically, favoring Trieste as the imperial seaport. Within 50 years of their acquisition of the former republic, Austria had taken more from the region than had been spent there and Venetian capitalism had been stifled by a reluctance on the part of the slow, bureaucratic Habsburg régime to grant credit to Venetian entrepreneurs. In the chaos of the springtime of nations, Daniele Manin entered the Venetian Arsenal with "a number of public-spirited Venetians", in a direct challenge to Austrian rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202007;The Serenissima Is Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202007;\n\nAfter 50 years of occupation, of humiliation and ignorance, the day of salvation has come. The streets are filled with weeping old people, which saw the gonfalon, the banner with the winged lion in their days of youth, and now--once again--see him shining in the sun of a new future. The songs of our fathers are sung again, and the cry "Viva San Marco!" is not prohibited anymore. Long live Venice, long live Saint Mark, long live the glory of our lion. Our patron saint has rescued us, he didn't forget his own people--Venice, our beloved home, is free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202008;Italian or Venetian?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202008;\n\nAfter the successful War of Independence, one topic is present in every tavern: the future of Venice. Some want to be unified with Sardinia, becoming later a part of a new united Italian state. Others are more cautious, willing to wait until this new state evolves and the day of decision has come. A last group isn't willing to join any state, underlining that Venice was and will be independent forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202019;Sardinia Wins the Italian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202019;\n\nThis is a great day for nationalists, patriots and all oppressed people in the world. The Italian people have won an important victory against Austria. Lombardy is now under Italian control, which may evolve to a new state, uniting all Italians under one flag. People in Milan and Turin are celebrating, and the nation will remember this day of glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202020;The Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202020;\n\nSardinia has made a White Peace with us. We should claim Milan, because it is still occupied by foreign troops. The international scene will agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202021;\n\nWe have made a White peace with Austria. We must return Milan, because it was under Austrian rule before the war. The international scene will be upset, if we don't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202022;Sardinia Remains Stubborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202022;\n\nSardinia doesn't return Milan--we must take it with force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME202024;Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202024;\n\nThe smashing defeat has serious consequences on our country. The abdication of our king provokes unrest. Advisers propose a new approach in our politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188156;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188156;According to the terms of the ultimatum delivered, the Serbian government would have to accept an $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ inquiry into the assassination, notwithstanding its claim that it was already conducting its own internal investigation. Serbia was also to suppress all anti-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda and to take steps to root out and eliminate terrorist organizations within its borders?one such organization, the Black Hand, was believed to have aided and abetted the archduke's killer, Gavrilo Princip, and his cohorts, providing weapons and safe passage from Belgrade to Sarajevo. $FROMCOUNTRY$ demanded an answer to the note within 48 hours - by that time, however, anticipating Serbian defiance, Gieslingen had already packed his bags and prepared to leave the embassy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME116303;The Great Drought of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC116303;In $YEAR$ the worst drought ever recorded afflicted the Northeast of Brazil. The result would be a massive emigration of peasants to new areas, such as the Amazonian city of Manaus which was becoming wealthy due to the start of the Rubber Boom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131509;The Czech National Theater;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131509;\n\nThe Czech National Theater is the embodiment of the will of the Czech nation for its national identity and independence. Collections of money among the broad masses of the people facilitated it's construction, and so the ceremonious laying of the foundation stone on the 16th of May,$YEAR$, was tantamount to an all-state political demonstration. The Czech National Theater was opened for the first time on the 11th of June, 1881, to honor the visit of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME131510;The Splitting of Charles University;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131510;\n\nGradually, as Czechs became more prosperous and more literate, significant advances were made--particularly in the use of the Czech language in education and in courts of law. In $YEAR$, the Czech departments in the long-established German university in Prague voted to become a separate and independent Czech-speaking university.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME131511;Theodor Herzl's 'Der Judenstaat';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131511;\n\nDer Judenstaat' ('The State of the Jews') was a book written by the Jewish journalist Theodor Herzl, and it was published in $YEAR$ in Leipzig and Vienna. As expressed in this book, Herzl envisioned the founding of a future independent Jewish state during the 20th century. He argued that the best way to avoid antisemitism in Europe was to create this independent Jewish state. The book encouraged Jews to purchase land in Palestine, although the possibility of a Jewish state in Argentina is also considered. It is considered one of the most important texts of early Zionism, indeed much popularizing the term "Zionism" which was originally coined by the Jewish thinker Nathan Birnbaum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME131512;The Stanczyks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131512;\n\nIn 1869 a group of young conservative publicists: Jozef Szujski, Stanislaw Tarnowski, Stanislaw Kozmian and Ludwik Wodzicki, published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled 'Teka Stanczyka' ('Stanczyk's Portfolio'). Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested a compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, and more concentration on economic growth than on political independence. The political faction which adopted these ideas became known as 'Stanczycy' (plural of 'Stanczyk').;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME131513;Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Yugoslavism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131513;\n\nA Croatian Bishop, in 1874 Strossmayer published a tract which detailed his ideas on South Slavic national and political unification. Calling his ideology Yugoslavism, Strossmayer drew from the earlier ideas of Illyrianism the goal of unification of South Slavs in an independent federation. Strossmayer's ideas gained support among the Croat and Serb liberal bourgeoisie and young radicals, and soon Croat and Serb politicians in the Empire began to espouse the ideals of the movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME146304;The Influence of Positivism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC146304;\n\nBased on the idea that the state should use rationalism and science to help society progress and develop, even at the expense of challenging traditional powers and values, the ideals of Positivism gained a great deal of support in Brazilian society, especially among military officers who resented the inability of Brazil's political elite to put tradition and privilege aside for the benefit of the nation as a whole. Some began to suggest that the military should overthrow the imperial system and promote the regeneration of Brazilian society based on positivist goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME36938;Publication of Durgeshnandini;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36938;\n\nToday the novel 'Durgeshnandini' was released in the book stores of Calcutta. The book, a love story set against the backdrop of Pathan-Mughal conflicts in West Bengal, is written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and is the first major novel in Bengali literature. While conservatives in Bengali society might be unimpressed with its lucidity, it accessibility is sure to be a draw to the people.\n\nBengali culture has been undergoing a sort of renaissance in recent decades. Starting with the works of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, an appreciation for the richness of India's past has grown together with an examination of the impact of the modern West upon it. As these elements blend together, reform movements are forming to eradicate native 'superstitions' (such as sati, caste-division, and untouchability).;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Often depicting exotic scenes from his homeland, offering an insight into a world unknown to most Europeans. Rasen Saleh's arrival at court can only mean he is looking for our patronage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211490;A Historic Kris;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211490;\n\nIn South Asian culture, a kris (an asymmetrical, usually curvy, dagger) is a spiritual and sacred object. Imbued with magical powers, they are thought to be inhabited by spirits and as such are "almost alive". Care of krisses is subject to great ceremony and ritual. Should the owner be negligent, the Kris might kill him in his sleep. Should the owner, however, be generous, the kris will protect him and imbue him with valor.\nRecently, the crown-prince of one of the East Indies Princely States fell ill. Neither western physicians, nor the local Dukun proved capable of helping. In a desperate move, the prince asked the renowned 'White Dukun', a Dutchman educated in both western and indigenous medicine, for help. Finding it as a case of guna-guna, the White Dukun worked his magic and managed to cure the crown-prince. For his efforts in securing the succession, the prince awarded the White Dukun with his most precious pusaka: an ancient kris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Invaluable information to us should we decide to expand to that vast land. On the naturalist side the expedition was less successful. A large number of hitherto unknown species of birds were discovered, and promptly killed for preservation. Aside from those samples large collection of stones and minerals was brought back. However, no grand new discoveries were made. Rather unexpectedly the expedition ran into an English naturalist called Wallace at an isolated German mission post. The man is doing research into the development of species, and claims to be on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the past few months they have made extensive maps of the coast of New Guinea: not only of the currents and water depths, but also of suitable locations for future posts. Invaluable information to us should we decide to expand to that vast land. On the naturalist side the expedition was fairly routine. A few new bird species discovered, some interesting rocks found. Nothing to get to excited about. That is until, rather unexpectedly, the expedition ran into an English naturalist called Wallace at an isolated German mission post. The man has been traveling the archipelago to research, what he calls, the introduction of new species.

We have finally finished rebuilding the palace. The original palace had three floors, but, as future protection against earthquakes, the new palace only has one. Of particular importance is 's Lands Plantentuin (the botanical gardens) surrounding the palace. Originally founded as a forest for rare species of plants during the Sunda Kingdom, they currently serve a primary research institute for the development and cultivation of new species of plants. As such, it is one of the most important institutes of tropical research in the world, and of vital importance to the plantation economy on Java.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211509;\n\nRaden Saleh is a Javanese painter has made quite a name for himself in the courts of Europe. This 'Eastern Prince,' son of a noble family, has studied the modern European painting techniques under our patronage, and is possibly the first oriental to do so. He has shown particular aptitude towards painting portraits, and many a ruler has been immortalized by his work. His landscapes too are a sight to behold. Inspired by his native land, the paintings show exquisite detail in the wild animals he depicts. But perhaps his most important work is his depiction of the capture of Prince Diponegoro at the Java War, provocatively depicting a noble prince Diponegoro and slightly "unbalanced" colonial officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME210460;Belgian-Dutch Language and Literature Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC210460;While a large part of our population speaks Dutch, it has never been a very important language. At court, in government and among the bourgeoisie French is 'la langue preferee', and Dutch is looked down onto with some disdain. This has left precious little room in our country for the development of the language. The situation is different of course by our neighbor to the north. The Dutch have proven more supportive of the Flemish, and both Dutch and Flemish scholars have now come together in Gent to discuss the language. The hope is to form a more unified and standardized language, and in imitation of German and French efforts, create an extensive dictionary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211590;The Nederlansch Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211590;\n\nOne of the causes of the Belgian Revolution was our language policy. The majority of the elites, being Francophone, disdained Dutch and our efforts to make it the national language. It should thus come as no surprise that, after independence, French was swiftly elected as the official language. This has caused some resentment among the Flemish, who find it gives precious little room for their own cultural expression.\nIn an effort to strengthen the cultural base of Dutch in Belgium, Flemish language scholars have joined up with Dutch language scholars in Ghent for an international language and literature congress.

EVTDESC211591;\n\nFor much of history, there has not been a unified Dutch language. Numerous regional varieties exists, with Hollandic Dutch being the most prominent. A movement towards a unified language does exist, but it hampered by a lack of an unambiguous structure of the language. Official rules regarding the language do exist, but they too show regional differences. Language scholars have now recommended to create one national dictionary, and get rid of the regional differences in spelling and pronunciation. A conference of linguists from both the Netherlands proper and Flanders has been inaugurated to this end. While the first conference is taking place at Ghent University, it will be held alternately in the Netherlands proper and Flanders in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211592;The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211592;\n\nAfter many years of work, the first true dictionary of the Dutch language has been produced: The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal. While there may have been earlier dictionaries, perhaps most famously by 16th century scholar Kiliaan, none of these were of the calibre of this new dictionary. They were mainly translation dictionaries, or used regional spelling differences. The 'Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederandsche Taal' uses the new (official and unified) spelling rules.\n\nThe dictionary as released is only the first of a large series. The aim of the dictionary is to describe every word in use in the Dutch language since 1500. Such a massive task will take many more years to complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211593;Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211593;\n\nThe teacher and scholar Johan van Dale has published a new dictionary of the Dutch language. It is based on the recent 'Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal', but has been significantly improved upon. The definitions given in the original dictionary were found to be to vague and imprecise by van Dale. As a teacher he aimed his dictionary at students, and desired a clear cut and precise definition of words.\n\nThe dictionary is often referred to as 'De Dikke van Dale' [The Thick one by van Dale], because, at 1400 pages, it is the thickest book in the common household, after the Bible of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211601;The Great City Fire of Enschede;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211601;\n\nA major fire has turned the entire medieval city of Enschede to ashes. 650 houses were destroyed, which in a city of only 4000 people means more than half of all citizens are left homeless. A number of factors can be blamed, drought, strong winds, improper fireproofing, but our own contribution to the fire should not be overlooked: in celebration of the king's visit the city was beautifully decorated with flowers, banners and triumphal arches. All of which proved to be very conductive to the spread of the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211602;From The Life Of King Gorilla;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211602;\n\nKing William has always been an odd bird. This is nothing new, but at least it had been kept out of the press. The (conservative) press has willingly swept it under the carpet all this time. The more radical press is less willing to cover it though. It would seem the madness of the king has reached socialist circles -- a pamphlet called 'A Day in the Life of King Gorilla' was recently released and has become quite popular. The pamphlet describes "the criminal life" and the "corrupted nature" of the royal house, calling the king an unconsidered "sadistic monster" who cares not about his people.\nThis, combined with another recent pamphlet describing the king as "a regal pig" and "horny mandrill", triggered some passionate feelings. Royalists have found cause to attack socialists and their establishments because of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211551;Johan Rudolph Thorbecke;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211551;With the newly published book 'Annotations to the Constitution' a young man by the name of Johan Rudolph Thorbecke has started making a name for himself in Liberal circles. The book, containing a detailed study of the nature and history of the constitution, has already sold over 1000 copies: an exceptionally large amount. It promises to be a standard work on the constitution for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211550;The Negenmannen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211550;Disappointed by our lack of constitutional reform, a group of 9 prominent Liberals have come together to propose their own constitution. Led by renowned statesman Thorbecke, they propose, among other things, a directly elected House of Representatives, based on census suffrage, full ministerial responsibility, reform of the senate, and better protection for the freedom of religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211400;The Cultuurstelsel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211400;The wars with Belgium, on Java and on Sumatra have drained the treasury, and we are quickly heading toward financial ruin. To increase the revenue from our colonies in the East, a new system called the Cultuurstelsel has been proposed, which will require farmers to grow cash crops for export. Replacing the old Landrente-tax, which required farmers to pay 2/5th of their harvest as tax, the Cultuurstelsel requires farmers to use 1/5th of their land to grow cash crops, mainly coffee, tea, sugar and indigo. Farmers who cannot grow these crops on their land are required to provide the Herendienst: 60 days of free labor per year to work on government plantations. Should the value of crops exceed the previously paid Landrente, the farmer is compensated accordingly by the Plantloon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211403;Overzealous Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211403;One of our lower colonial officers, an assistant-resident in Western Java, has taken a very zealous approach to his job. Disturbed by the abuses of the Cultuurstelsel and Herendienst he found in his regency, he accused the local Head of severe abuse of power and bondage of his subjects. While of course his position requires him to reign in local excesses and protect the populace, his primary concern should be the protection of our interests! Currently, the authority of the Head is sacred and unquestionable to the populace. Bringing him to court might cause severe social upheaval. As such, the Resident has called the Assistent-Resident to order and stopped the prosecution of the Head. This did not deter the Assistent-Resident. The case has now reached the Governor-General who has to decided to continue the prosecution, and risk rebellion, or put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211404;Disgruntled Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211404;A former colonial officer who left the service after an altercation with a local Regent, has now written to you complaining about the treatment he has received. A fervent liberal and proponent of inlander rights, he claims to have written a book detailing abuses committed by both the colonial government and local Heads under the Cultuurstelsel. Having been reduced to poverty by his treatment, he is threatening to publish this book unless he is fully rehabilitated, which in this case means: a position of Regent on Java, full restoration of his pension, a large advance and, most preposterously, a decoration for his "service".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211405;Multatuli;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211405;I am broker in coffee, and live on the Lauriersgracht No. 37.\nWith these words begins the novel Max Havelaar, which has by now "sent a shudder through the land". The novel describes the consequences of the colonial system in Java, in which government and local Heads cooperated to enrich themselves at the expense of the people. In the example of the body of the Javanese, murdered on the orders of the regent, floating down the river as a present from the sharks of the interior to the sharks in the sea, after that poor wretch had complained about the Regent, the "humdrum" story of that one buffalo of Saidjah's father, the village in Lampung set ablaze by Dutch forces. Cumulating in the majestic, almost terrifying, final chord in which Multatuli exposed Holland as a "pirate state" among the nations, and conjured the king not to tolerate any longer that more than 30 million Javanese are maltreated and exploited in his name in the "glorious realm of Insulinde, that coiled round the Equator like a girdle of emerald".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211409;Java, or How to Manage a Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211409;Long has our colony on Java been the envy of the world. The vast wealth provided by the Cultuurstelsel has propelled our nation forwards, and this has not gone unnoticed abroad. In a recently published book, called 'Java, or How to Manage a Colony', the aptly named Englishman James Money described our colonial administration of Java, the Cultuurstelsel in particular, as the example of how a colony should be run. He writes that a similar system would solve many of the problems facing British India today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211411;The Koloniale Kwestie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211411;A weighty responsibility lies on the people blessed with such history as ours. Contemporaries and progeny might rightfully question, what we, sons of such a dearly bought freedom, have done with this freedom? Can we, after three centuries, with a clean conscience and our heads held high answer: We are worthy descendants of such heroes? Is it but lies and slander that we exploit the Javanese?\n[...]\nThe Cultuurstelsel has made our country the disgrace of the world. We have surrendered the honor of being a civilized nation: for even the Spanish did not treat our forefathers so unchristian.\nThat a moral nation pur sang like ours, which does not rely on brute force but moral superiority in international politics, should allow for her subjects to be exploited, has started to create a feeling of unease in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211900;Maatschappij tot Nut van den Javaan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211900;A new 'Society to the Benefit of the Javanese' has been founded with to combat all injustice against Javanese, no matter the source. The society considers it a great sin that, in our name, Javanese should be exploited. Being the foremost Christian nation under God, it should fall to us to uplift the inlanders! Perhaps under our guidance can the Javanese can do away with their superstitions and join the ranks of civilized peoples. The society has started to raise money to fund (Christian) schools in the East.\nThe paternalistic nature of the society, however, has not fallen well with more liberal elements of our society. Multatuli, perhaps the foremost "friend of the Javanese", has published a damning commentary of their work: "He who does indeed value Civilization does not ridicule her by spreading more or less illustrated school books, prints and atlases to those who he systematically exploits, abuses and murders".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211901;Baron Van Hoevell;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211901;People of the Netherlands, does a bloodguilt not burn on your consciousness? For two centuries has your flag flow on Java: For two centuries you have waived the scepter of domination: Millions upon millions have flowed to your treasure on the toiling of the inlanders: And you have returned nothing to them.\nMember of Parliament Wolter Robert baron van Hoevell has emerged as one of the strongest critics of our colonial administration of Java and the Cultuurstelsel in particular. Originally serving as a minister in Batavia, he was forced to leave the Indies due to his liberal and anti-governmental tendencies. Very popular in the Indies: it is said that when he left, he was sent of by "half of Batavia". As one of the few MPs who has actually visited the Indies, he can describe the situation there with great expertise and "disturbing eloquence".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211418;The Agrarische Wet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211418;While vital for the financial well-being of our nation, the Cultuurstelsel has its opponents. Especially in liberal circles there is a lot of criticism of the system. They view the Cultuurstelsel as an inefficient and inflexible economic system, unable to respond adequately to changing circumstance. In their view the East Indies would benefit from opening up to private capital. The treatment of the Inlanders is also a point of contention. They hold the Cultuurstelsel as deeply immoral, as it denies the local education, Christianity and the blessings of progress. The Agrarische Wet seeks to abolish the Cultuurstelsel and its governmental plantations, and open the East Indies up to private investment. Ownership of the land is returned to the Inlanders and western individuals can lease lands from them or the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211440;The Suikerwet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211440;The Agrarische Wet has been the first step in abolishing the Cultuurstelsel. However due its economic importance, the sugar industry had been exempted from the Agrarische Wet. This never set well with the liberal elements of society, and they have always pushed to end the governmental monopoly on sugar. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to this effect.\nUnder the Suikerwet the government relinquishes its monopoly on sugar, and opens the sugar market to private capital, provided the sugar is refined in Dutch refineries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211441;The Koffiewet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211441;While in the days of the VOC spices such nutmeg and cloves might have been the economic motor of the Indies, since the late 18th century coffee has been the cork keeping our economy afloat. Therefore, when the Agrarische Wet was passed, the coffee cultures were specifically exempted. This never set right with the liberals and other proponents of a liberal economy. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to finally bring an end to Cultuurstelsel, and the governmental monopoly on the coffee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211445;The Ethische Politiek;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211445;The Indies have always been a profit center to our nation. While great wealth has flowed to our great nation, the poor inlanders have seen little benefit from our rule. In fact, they have suffered dearly from abuse and exploitation under our rule. Some would say we have incurred a debt of honor towards the inlanders. They are proposing we follow a more Ethical Policy towards the inlanders. We would take ethical responsibility towards our inlander populace, and extend all benefits from being part of our great nation towards them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211800;The Pill Bandoeng;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211800;Malaria is an ever present danger in the tropical regions of the world. There are few effective treatments for the disease, and those which do exist are expensive. Our control over the production of Quinine from the Cinchona tree has given our citizens abundant and relatively cheap access to the medicine. However, the inlander population has been unable to profit from this, and continues to be ravaged by the disease. A bill has been proposed in parliament to fund the construction of a large Quinine factory on Java. This factory will be specifically to supply the natives with this important medicine, and extend the benefits of Dutch civilization to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME211801;The School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC211801;We have always kept medical professions in the Indies a strictly western affair. There have been hospitals and doctors for inlanders, but never any inlander doctors and physicians. This has obviously had a negative effect on the access to modern medical care for inlanders. Most are now surrendered to the whims of the dukuns, and the magic and superstition they perpetrate. To combat this, and improve the plight of our colonial subjects, it has been suggested we start training inlanders in the medical profession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Supporting this program would anger most of the Afro Americans in our nation, however this could be the solution for the ethnic issues between whites and black--even if it means we have to force them to go to Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC188162;\n\nAfter the liberal José Manuel Balmaceda was elected president of Chile in 1886, he fostered public works, improved health care and public education. In $YEAR$, his programs met opposition in the Chilean congress, which rejected his budget. Balmaceda announced that he would proceed without the congress, which soon deposed him and appointed naval officer Jorge Montt as provisional president. The navy supports the congress, while Balmaceda retains control of the army and exercises dictatorial powers in the capital of Santiago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188163;Sonderbund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188163;The Sonderbund was a league created in 1845 in Switzerland between seven Catholic and Conservative cantons, in order to protect their interests against a centralization of power by the Protestant and Liberal cantons. This alliance was concluded after the Federal Diet, with the approval of a majority of cantons, had taken measures against the Catholic Church. When Lucerne, in retaliation, recalled the Jesuits the same year, groups of armed radicals invaded the canton, causing a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188164;The Sonderbund War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188164;The Sonderbund was in violation of the Federal Treaty of 1815, which expressly forbade such separate alliances, and the Radical majority in the Federal Diet decided to dissolve the Sonderbund in $YEAR$. The confederate army was raised against the members of the Sonderbund. The army was composed of soldiers of all the other states except Neuchâtel and Appenzell Innerrhoden which had stayed neutral. Ticino, while a Catholic canton, did not join the Sonderbund and fought with the Protestants. The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties. It ended with the victory of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188165;The Sicilian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188165;The Congress of Vienna reunited the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily for the first time since the 13th century as the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The administration of the island was brutal, corrupt and inefficient. Dissatisfaction spilled over into open revolution three times. In $YEAR$ political agitators in Palermo circulated a pamphlet which called on all Sicilians to rise up against the Bourbons on Ferdinand's birthday. By the time the Bourbon troops arrived by sea, the revolutionaries were in control of the city and then the whole island. As the Neapolitan army retreated, those with a more defined political agenda emerged as the leaders and established committees in an effort to channel and control the momentum of the uprising. They demanded that Ferdinand restore the 1812 constitution, an appeal which attracted support from the middle and upper classes. In response, the king offered local self-government on condition that Bourbon sovereignty remained, but the revolutionaries rejected this and insisted that Sicily should have complete independence from Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188166;The Cretan Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188166;The island of Crete and its Greek majority have been the center of numerous revolts in recent years. After several failed attempts at union with Greece, the situation reached a boiling point. As tension ran high in the island, and several petitions to the Sultan went unanswered, armed bands were formed, an the uprising was officially proclaimed in $YEAR$. The revolt caused immediate sympathy not only in Greece, but also elsewhere in Europe. Rebels spread throughout the rural areas of Crete and have taken over a good portion of the island. It is now up to us to decide what happens to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188167;The Annexation of Eastern Rumelia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188167;The Congress of Berlin left Bulgaria divided into two sections: the area north of the Balkan Mountains and Sofia became a widely autonomous principality, Eastern Rumelia between the Balkan and Rhodope Mountains gained semi-autonomous status with an Ottoman appointed Christian governor. Although Bulgaria was technically under the suzerainty of the Sublime Porte, this was a legal fiction that Bulgaria only acknowledged in a formal way and acted largely as a de facto independent state. In $YEAR$, a rebellion and coup in Eastern Rumelia, led by Bulgarians, saw the people proclaim a union with the state of Bulgaria. According to the Berlin Treaty the Sultan was only allowed to send troops in Eastern Rumelia at the request of the governor, who at the time was a Bulgarian patriot and made no such request. The great powers seem indifferent about the whole situation, so it's up to us to decide what happens next. Recognizing the annexation would only solidify Bulgaria's de facto independent status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188168;The Balkan League;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188168;\n\nCompeting claims to Ottoman held territories, especially Macedonia, prevented the Balkan states from cooperating against the Ottomans for far too long. The recent struggles of the Ottoman Empire however finally gave us a good opportunity to fulfill our desires of expansion. Because of the Great Powers' unwillingness to help our cause, this proposed Balkan League is our best chance: a joint effort of the Balkan nations would surely be enough to kick the Turks out of the Balkans, once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188174;The Uruguayan Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188174;On July 18, 1830, Uruguay enacted its first constitution. Uruguay's leaders fiercely protected free speech within the nation's parliament--even when legislators voiced views that directly opposed those of the president. These measures did not mean that Uruguay's early decades were easy or calm, however: in addition to threats from its much larger neighbors, the young nation suffered from internal strife. The new constitution had made José Fructuoso Rivera the country's first president. When his political rival, Manuel Oribe became president in 1834, Fructuoso revolted against him. By the mid-1830s, two fiercely opposed political parties had emerged from these internal struggles. Oribe headed a group called the Blancos, who mainly represented gauchos, shepherds, and other rural citizens. Fructuoso led their opponents, the Colorados, who were more supportive of the residents of Montevideo and their business interests. As battles between the groups increased, the rivalry grew into a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME188175;The Uruguayan Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188175;Argentina has traditionally held the right to intervene in Uruguayan internal affairs as it sees fit, but in recent months the liberal Colorado government has proven to be increasingly intransigent.

EVTDESC46613;Urquiza was not a unitarian, but another federalist like Rosas. Thus, the unitarians did not support him, but opposed him as they did Rosas. Urquiza's ambition to reduce the national centralism of Buenos Aires and promote a higher federalization of the country generated conflicts with the unitarians. Urquiza called the San Nicolás Agreement, so that all provinces agreed to convene the Constituent Assembly. This was resisted in Buenos Aires, and the unitarians took advantage of a temporary absence of Urquiza from the city and secede Buenos Aires from the confederation. Negotiations are underway since then, however they are unwilling to give up their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Conservative Party advocated a strong central government. Its supporters consisted of the commercial elite. The Liberals argued for greater regional autonomy. Their ranks consisted mostly of the remnants of the old landed aristocracy and of the urban middle class. After José Tadeo Monagas was driven from power by a revolution in $YEAR$ - in which both Liberals and Conservatives participated - a new regime was set up.

EVTDESC188188;In an effort to secure control of the strategic Khyber Pass, in $YEAR$, Great Britain dispatched a British diplomat, Mortimer Durand, to negotiate an agreement to delineate the border between the Emirate of Afghanistan and British India. The agreement would result in a frontier that runs from the Karakoram Range in the northeast running south through the Spin Ghar mountains before turning west along the Chagai Hills to the border with Persia. The new border, dubbed the Durand Line, would divide the Pashtun tribal lands, a region informally referred to as Pasthunistan in two, with half of the Pashtun tribal region now part of British India and the balance remaining part of Afghanistan. The Durand Line would also ensure that there would be a thin strip of Afghanistan running to the Chinese border, thus separating the Russian Empire from British India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME3721123;Louis Napoleon's Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3721123;I believe, Louis Napoleon wrote, "that from time to time, men are created whom I call volunteers of providence, in whose hands are placed the destiny of their countries. I believe I am one of those men. If I am wrong, I can perish uselessly. If I am right, then providence will put me into a position to fulfill my mission." He had seen the popular enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte when he was in Paris, and he was convinced that, if he marched to Paris, as Napoleon Bonaparte had done in 1815 during the One Hundred Days, France would rise up and join him. He began to plan a coup against King Louis-Philippe. He planned for his uprising to begin in Strasbourg. The colonel of a regiment was brought over to the cause. In $YEAR$, Louis Napoleon arrived in Strasbourg, in the uniform of an officer of artillery, and rallied the regiment to his side. The prefecture was seized, and the prefect arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37203;\n\nLouis-Napoleon had not given up the dream of returning to France to seize power. In $YEAR$, he bought weapons and uniforms and had proclamations printed, gathered a contingent of about sixty armed men, hired a ship called the Edinburgh-Castle, and sailed across the Channel to the port of Boulogne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46620;The Triple Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46620;\n\nIn $YEAR$ the old struggle between conservative and liberal factions broke out once more in Uruguay when the Colorado leader Venancio Flores rose against President Bernardo Berro of the Blanco party. Since Paraguayan dictator Solano López had always supported the Blancos he declared any interference in Uruguay to be unacceptable. Supporting the Colorados would give us a chance to finally end the López regime and take our claims if he decides to intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46621;The Triple Alliance Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46621;\n\nWe have won the war against all odds! The Triple Alliance has been defeated and agreed to negotiate peace without conditions. The question is now, how harsh should our conditions be? Securing our sea access should be enough to minimize future conflicts, however this is our best chance to become a regional power--but for how long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46622;The Triple Alliance Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46622;\n\nSolano López is dead and Paraguay lays in ruins--the war is over. As Paraguay isn't a threat anymore, we can just take our claims and keep the country a buffer state. However some of our politicians argue that Paraguay is a non-country and it should be partitioned between Argentina and Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46623;\n\nThe consequences of defeat were disastrous for Paraguay. Argentina and Brazil annexed about 54,000 square miles of Paraguayan territory - almost half the country. Initially the Argentine negotiators proposed to simply divide Paraguay between Argentina and Brazil, but the Brazilians refused, preferring to maintain a buffer state between themselves and their old rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46624;\n\nAt the end of the war, with Paraguay suffering severe shortages of weapons and supplies, Solano López reacted with draconian attempts to keep order, ordering troops to kill any of their colleagues, including officers, who talked of surrender. Paranoia prevailed in the army, and soldiers fought to the bitter end in a resistance movement, resulting in more destruction in the country. Meanwhile the Triple Alliance has decided to divide Paraguay between Argentina and Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46625;The Future of Paraguay;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46625;\n\nWith Paraguay becoming a relevant power in the region, many wonder what will be the next move of Solano López. Most likely he will crown himself emperor as he ordered an exact replica of Napoleon's crown for himself. Some believe he will keep his dictatorial powers, but a vocal minority speculates that he will--with a move as unexpected as the war--transition the country to democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME188192;$YEAR$ Mount Lebanon Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC188192;A major Maronite peasant uprising began in Keserwan against their Druze overlords, spilling into the surrounding countryside. This has prompted mass infighting between two religious sects, with thousands of Druze and Christians dead already, and the Maronites massacred in the streets. The international community has now taken notice and demands we do something about this, but it is up to us to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC980081;The Transylvanian Diet has voted for affiliation with Hungary.

EVTNAME36983;Fate of the Franklin Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36983;In $YEAR$, a document has been found in a cairn left by Captain Crozier and Captain Fitzjames, who were informing the Admiralty that Franklin had died, and the remaining survivors were heading south towards the Back River as the ships had been trapped in the ice for years. John Rae discovered further evidence of the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk who told him of a party of 35 to 40 white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. It seems like the expedition had suffered a fate as terrible as the imagination can conceive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36984;Franklin Expedition Found;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36984;In $YEAR$, survivors of the Franklin Expedition have been found near the Back River. The men were starving and suffering from serious lead poisoning, which probably contributes to a shocking claim they made about a giant polar bear chasing and killing them. Although Franklin himself and most of his men had died, finding the last remaining survivors is truly a great miracle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46628;The Venezuelan Crisis of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46628;\n\nIn 1814, Great Britain had acquired British Guiana by treaty with the Netherlands. Because the treaty did not define a western boundary, the British commissioned Robert Schomburgk, a surveyor and naturalist, to delineate that boundary. His survey resulted in what came to be known as the Schomburgk Line, a boundary that effectively claimed an additional 30,000 square miles for Guiana. Venezuela claimed its borders extended as far east as the Essequibo River - an effective claim on two-thirds of British Guiana's territory. When gold was discovered in the disputed territory, Great Britain sought to further extend its reach, claiming an additional 33,000 square miles west of the Schomburgk Line, an area where gold had been discovered. In $YEAR$ Venezuela protested, broke diplomatic relations with Great Britain, and appealed to the United States for assistance, citing the Monroe Doctrine as justification for US involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99401;\n\nBy $YEAR$, a citizen of San Francisco called Joshua Abraham Norton had become completely discontented with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the Californian Republic. He took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself "Emperor of California" (he later added "Protector of Mexico" to this title). The announcement was first printed for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin.

EVTNAME37252;General Boulanger;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37252;A graduate of the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, Georges Boulanger entered the army in 1856 and saw service in Italy, Algeria, Indochina, and the Franco-German War. Wounded in suppressing the Paris Commune, he was appointed brigadier general and director of infantry. Two years later he was appointed to command the army in North Africa but was recalled because of differences of opinion with the governor of the protectorate. Returning to Paris, he began to take part in politics and in $YEAR$ he entered the government as minister of war. He won popularity in the army through various reforms (improvement of soldiers' food and living conditions, and so on), heavy expenditures on the army, and his aggressive hostility towards Germany. Boulanger talked of avenging the defeat that France had suffered in the conflict with the Germans--which earned him the nickname Général Revanche--and he won some distinguished adherents by his denunciation of party divisions and corruption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37253;The Rise of Boulangism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37253;Boulanger began to receive unsolicited electoral support in special elections for the Chamber of Deputies. The government feared his support and assigned him to an obscure military outpost. He gained notoriety by his bold attacks on the government, his demands for a dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, and for a revision of the constitution. He was deprived of his command in $YEAR$ for coming to Paris twice without leave, and his name was removed from the army list. He was, however, almost at once elected to the chamber for the Nord. The radical socialists, who seek a more democratic republic, joined hands with the Royalists and the Bonapartists, who hope for the overthrow of the republic, in pledging him their support and thus making him a tool in the hands of groups hostile to the existing republican dispensation. A coup d'état seems probable and desirable among his supporters: Boulanger has now become a threat to the parliamentary republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37254;Boulanger's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37254;The big opportunity for Boulanger came in $YEAR$ when he was elected in Paris by an overwhelming majority. The victory was clinched by the royalist and radical socialist voters all casting ballots against the republic as constituted. A crowd around 30,000 of his supporters gathered outside the restaurant where Boulanger and his committee awaited the election results. Urged by enthusiasts, the crowd and several within his closest circle called upon Boulanger to lead a march to the presidential palace and stage a coup. There is nothing we can do to stop him if he decides to seize the opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37255;The Fate of Boulanger;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37255;Boulanger's refusal to lead the coup gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back. Ernest Constans, the Minister of the Interior, decided to investigate the matter, and attacked the League of Patriots using the law banning the activities of secret societies. Shortly afterward the French government issued a warrant for Boulanger's arrest for conspiracy and treasonable activity. To the astonishment of his supporters, he fled Paris before it could be executed, going first to Brussels and then to London. The Parliament stripped him of his immunity from prosecution, the French Senate condemned him and his supporters, Rochefort, and Count Dillon for treason, sentencing all three to deportation and confinement. After his flight, support for him dwindled, and the Boulangists were defeated in the elections. Boulanger himself returned to the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels to commit suicide by a bullet to the head on the grave of his mistress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37256;Boulanger's Constitutional Revision;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37256;After defeating all resistance and successfully consolidating his power, Boulanger could finally focus on his promised constitutional revision. The problem is his groups of supporters all have different ideas of what this new constitution should be: the radical socialists seek a a stronger republican government capable of achieving social reforms, the Orléanists want a constitutional monarchy under the Count of Paris, while the Bonapartists want to restore the French Empire. Of course he could always listen to the voices who say he is the only one capable of restoring France to its former glory...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10412;The Paris Commune;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10412;During the Franco-German War, the people of Paris have prepared for an eventual siege and bought canons, manned by the citizens of the town. The government, fighting off the Germans, asked for the weapons to be seized and fitted with French soldiers, eventually going eastward and making Paris defenseless. As the tension escalated, a large part of the population has formed an autonomous collectivity inside the city, based on communist ideas of equality and council-based governing. While the government stalled, the dissent grew and now other cities share similar situations. A council was formed inside the "Commune of Paris", taking progressive decisions directly inspired by socialist and communist theories. While still preparing for war, they have arranged a society with free press, women participation, mandatory education and welfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
