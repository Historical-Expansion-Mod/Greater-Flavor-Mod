reichelt_jump_title;Reichelt's Last Jump;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reichelt_jump_desc;\n\nA somewhat eccentric tailor and inventor, Franz Reichelt drew crowds at the Eiffel Tower to demonstrate his creation, a full-body parachute suit. While local authorities believed he intended to drop a simple dummy from the tower, onlookers were greatly surprised to see Franz himself climb the tower, despite attempts from his friends to delay the jump due to high winds. To the shock and dismay of the crowd (and a visiting film crew), his parachute did not deploy, wrapping itself around the inventor, and he fell to his death sixty meters below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

WREATHTITLE;The Mountain Wreath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WREATHDESC;\n\nEver a poet, our Prince-Bishop Petar has written an epic play he has dubbed 'The Mountain Wreath'. Set in the reign of Danilo I, the founder of the house of Petrovic-Njegoš, the poem focuses on the legendary massacre of Muslim converts on some Christmas day. The ideological nature of the piece has been questioned by some, claiming it glorifies the slaughter of Muslims, while others take it as a true national epic of the Montenegrin people and a literary masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FLOOD1862TITLE;The Great Flood of 1862;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FLOOD1862DESC;\n\nMassive floods have spread across much of the West, from the central valley of California to the scrublands of Nevada, to the foothills of the Oregon Cascades. Weeks of torrential downpour have drowned many lowlying areas in ten feet or more of water, turning valleys into lakes, roads into canals, and drowning untold numbers of cattle and humans alike. Reports tell of citizens in Sacramento navigating the city streets on improvised canoes and rafts - of roads, rail, bridges and telegraph lines washed away - and of entire farms, orchards, and mines being destroyed by the rising waters. Above all else thousands have lost their lives, and many more have lost their homes and livelihoods. It will take years for regional infrastructure to recover from the deluge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FLOOD1862OPT;God have mercy on the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIJEPATITLE;Lijepa Naša Domovino;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIJEPADESC;\n\nBased on a poem by the lyricist Antun Mihanovic, a local composer by the name of Josip Runjanin has composed a patriotic song titled Lijepa naša domovino - "Our beautiful homeland". Quickly adopted by nationalists and patriots across Croatia, it has become an unofficial anthem for Croatia, speaking of the beauty and glory of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIJEPAOPT;"Mila kano si nam slavna...";;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBEXTITLE;The Last Portuguese Ibex;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBEXDESC;\n\nOver the past century, the Ibex has become a much rarer sight in Portugal. Only a small mountain herd was known to exist, and these too were lost from poaching and disease. A work crew managed to capture and photograph a lone goat after first unsuccessfully trying to shoot it, but another has not been found since. Besides the occasional rumored sighting, always without clear evidence, it may be safe to assume that the Ibex has finally disappeared from the hills of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBEXOPT;Adeus, Ibex.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEMANAARTETITLE;Semana de Arte Moderna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEMANAARTEDESC;\n\nA great weeklong festival of modernist art has been held at the Municipal Theater of São Paulo, with events featuring poetry, paintings, concerts, and lectures. However, conflict and controversy plagued the event, with new movements forming out of the division - such as the "Anthropophagics", who seek to create a new Brazilian art out of the 'cannibalizing' of European and American art - and the highly nativist Nationalists, who seek to create a new and purely Brazilian modernism. In addition to the ripples in the domestic art sphere, the event has also served to promote São Paulo to a modern cultural capital of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEMANAARTEOPT;Now, what happened to the art of the good ol days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUANGERUPTION;\n\nThe mountainous islet of Ruang in the Sangihes, an island chain off Sulawesi, erupted into a pyre of smoke and flame. While the small isle is uninhabited, the nearby island of Tagulandang was flooded in a large tsunami, destroying its several small towns and villages and drowning several hundred beneath the waves. A visiting zoologist described the devastation as horrid, with dozens of houses either pushed off their foundation and wrecked, or swept entirely out to sea. Even a sturdy local church was destroyed, as the villagers now pray and scavenge whatever they can from the broken remains of their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BANDAIERUPTION;\n\nMount Bandai, located in the highlands of Iwashiro province, erupted into a great inferno following weeks of earthquakes. A massive, fiery lahar destroyed great amounts of forest and farmland around the mountain as well as several villages. Ash buried crops many miles from the eruption. If there is any silver lining to the disaster, it has been the rapid response from the fledgling Japanese Red Cross, as well as great documentation and research by local geologists due to the volcano's relative vicinity to Tokyo. As rescue operations continue, rivers and streams, diverted by the landslides, have created a set of five lakes in the vicinity, nicknamed the "Five Colored Lakes" due to their vivid hues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANFERMINQUAKE;\n\nA great earthquake struck the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, killing over a hundred and causing widespread damages to homes and businesses. The quake caused mudslides, destroyed bridges, and levelled many barrios in MayagÃ¼ez and Aguadilla, an ensuing tsunami killed many of the survivors and washed much of what had survived out to sea. It has been reported that camps have formed high up in the inland hills, with local residents afraid to venture back for fear of aftershocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KEELUNGQUAKE;\n\nThe northern coast of the isle of Formosa was devastated first by a massive earthquake, and then by the largest tsunami to strike the island in living memory. The cities of Taipei and Keelung were struck by giant landslides which buried homes, while spreading cracks in the earth became the graves of many local residents. The tremors even triggered the eruption of hot springs and geysers, with at least one villager drowning in the boiling springs. A great recession of water led local fishermen to walk out to the beach to collect fish, who were then drowned beneath a great wave twenty feet high, which poured through the already damaged coastal communities. Keelung, a well respected harbor, was luckily saved from the worst of the tsunami, while other villages along the coast were almost completely destroyed. The exact death toll is unknown, but is estimated by local officials to be at least 500.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAWAIIQUAKE;\n\nThe Big Island of Hawai'i was struck by a truly massive earthquake. Large foreshocks had been reported for days, with some even large enough to cause damage to homes - but several days after the first, a huge tremor shook the whole of the island. Homes, farms, and churches were all smashed. Wooden homes were knocked off foundations, thatched houses were shredded, and even large stone buildings crumbled into pieces. Several ancient villages were ruined, docks and warehouses across the coast were destroyed, and mudslides descended from Mauna Loa and buried many homes and men alike. Around eighty were killed in the event, with many more left homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PITTSBURGHFIRE;\n\nA conflagration has swept across the Pennsylvanian city of Pittsburgh. Large amount of haphazard immigration and development had left much of the city center a maze of poorly-constructed wooden shacks and tenements, and had exceeded the limitations of the city's water supply, despite its adjacency to the Ohio River. When an early morning blaze on a dry, windy morning swept through a poor neighborhood of the town, the city's all-volunteer fire departments were unable to control it - banks, churches, the mansions of the rich, the shacks of the poor - all were charred beneath the flames. Despite the calamity, only two are known to have died in the blaze, and a surge of rebuilding efforts have reached the city even as the last of the ash is swept away. The city and state government have requested federal funds to finance the creation of new infrastructure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OHIOCANALDESC;\n\nAfter over a decade of surveying and construction, the Ohio & Erie Canal system has reached full completion, linking Lake Erie with the Ohio River. Large amounts of freight can now be moved across the state, boosting local industry and agriculture. It has also spurred a series of connecting branches to other communities across Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Development in eastern Ohio has steadily progressed, and cities such as Cleveland and Akron have become industrial centers in their own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCHOOLBLIZZARDTITLE;The Schoolhouse Blizzard;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCHOOLBLIZZARDDESC;\n\nA sudden and terrible blizzard has swept across much of the Midwest on what was assumed to be a fairly tepid winter day. As temperatures warmed to just above freezing, many students returned to study at their schools, who were then trapped in a fury of snow not seen since the Long Winter of 1880. Visibility was so poor that many students and teachers who attempted to leave the schoolhouses became trapped in the snow and quickly perished, while many of those who survived suffered frostbite and required amputations. Rumors even abound of one Nebraska schoolteacher tying her students together with a rope and leading them a mile through the snow to the safety of her home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SCHOOLBLIZZARDOPT;As a kid, I always prayed for a snow day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLOQUETTITLE;The Cloquet Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLOQUETDESC;\n\nWide swaths of the conifer forest and logging towns north of Duluth, including the towns of Cloquet and Moose Lake, were burned to the ground over the last few days. A spark on a logging railway created a massive blaze which incinerated hundreds of thousands of acres and hundreds of lives. Tens of thousands lost their homes. Reports tell of trains, backed beyond capacity with evacuees, desperately racing through the very flames themselves to safety, singeing the railcars and burning passengers. A large squadron of local automobiles braved the flame-lapped roads to evacuate a local orphanage and the two-hundred patients of a nearby sanatorium. Relief crews reported seeing piles of hundreds of bodies strewn among the burned-over woods. The region's paper and timber industries have reported to be completely devastated due to the great deforestation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLOQUETOPT;Dear god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HINCKLEYTITLE;Great Hinckley Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HINCKLEYDESC;\n\n200,000 acres of pine forest, the town of Hinckley, and nearly 500 lives were lost in a tragic inferno. Large piles of logging debris caught fire, engulfing the surrounding community within less than an hour. Two trains quickly pulled out of the town to evacuate as many as they could, and those who were unable to board jumped into wells and streams to avoid the flames. As well as Hinckley, several other smaller logging communities were damaged. In rural areas, bodies of natives and backcountry hermits have continuously been discovered for weeks.  Among the dead listed is Boston Corbett, famed for shooting Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HINCKLEYOPT;These logging towns are a tinderbox...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MATHESONTITLE;The Matheson Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MATHESONDESC;\n\nSlash-and-burn clearing of local woodlands turned into tragedy across much of rural northeastern Ontario. Several intentional fires converged into a massive firestorm, burning half a million acres and killing hundreds across wide swaths of rural country. Some escaped on local railway lines, while others jumped into lakes, swamps, and rivers as they watched their homes burn into nothing but ruins. Massive temporary morgues have been constructed to house and identify the hundreds of charred remains pulled from the wreckage. With the tragedy have accelerated demands for greater safety regulations to prevent such disasters from occurring again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MATHESONOPT;So many lives lost tragically...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRISTATETITLE;The 1925 Tornado Outbreak;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRISTATEADESC;\n\n1925 has been an unusually devastating year for tornadoes, with one in particular, the so-called "Tri-State Tornado" carving a line of destruction two-hundred miles long across Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Nearly a thousand have been killed, and millions of dollars of damages have been reported as entire communities have been smashed to pieces by the storm. Other smaller twisters have led to dozens of deaths across the Midwest and the upland south. A multi-state cleanup effort has been launched, with the governments of the states most affected by the outbreak deploying their national guard to survey and assist with rebuilding efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TRISTATEAOPT;Our nation is strong, we will rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nearly a thousand have been killed, and millions of dollars of damages have been reported as entire communities have been smashed to pieces by the storm. Other smaller twisters have led to dozens of deaths across the Midwest and the upland south. The Confederate government, in a rare moment of détente with the northern states, has offered cross-border assistance in the rebuilding efforts. As Yankee and Dixie national guards and construction crews survey and assist with rebuilding efforts, some of the older survivors can recall a unity long since lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LONGWINTERTITLE;\n\nThe Hard Winter of 1880-81;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONGWINTERDESC;\n\nAn unusually intense winter has blanketed much of the Midwest in many feet of snow. In some areas, the snow has amassed to such a point that it has entirely cut off railway lines, restricting the flow of fuel and other necessities to farming and logging towns across the region. After months of reccuring blizzards, the snow began to finally thaw - but great floods have begun along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, causing significant infrastructure damage. In Omaha, the flooding was so intense that the very course of the Missouri River bent significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONGWINTEROPT;Summer can't come soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PINCHEIRATITLE;The Battle of Epulafquen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PINCHEIRADESC;\n\nThe band of infamous Royalist outlaws, the Hermanos Pincheira, have finally been defeated in a rural stretch of mountainside on the border with Neuquén province, near the Lagoons of Equalafquen. Their leader, José Antonio Pincheira, had amassed a force of two hundred armed royalists and over a hundred Pehuenche allies. While camping near the lakes, they were beset by a large force of Chilean cavalry in the command of General Manuel Bulnes. Pincheira's guards, stationed alongside the narrow mountain valleys were killed on sight to avoid raising the alarm. Two escaped and fled back to camp, so the full force of Bulnes' troops descended into the Pincheirista camp by dead of night and slaughtered any who they could find - royalist and native alike. A small band of outlaws escaped onto a nearby hillside, but without ammunition, they resorted to hurling rocks at the ascending troops before eventually surrendering. The last royalist resistance in Chile has been broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PINCHEIRAOPT;These dread royalist bandits will bother us no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PETITJOURNALTITLE;Le Petit Journal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PETITJOURNALDESC;\n\nA new Parisian daily newspaper, Le Petit Journal, has reached extreme amount of popularity. Within two years of its founding, its print run had exceeded the combined totals of all other daily newspapers in the city put together, and has begun to circulate all throughout the country. Every issue's nameplate reads "NON-POLITIQUE" to avoid a 10 centime fee on all sales, allowing the paper to be sold at a fraction of the cost of other daily papers. Despite the supposed non-political nature, however, Le Petit has been known to take a very conservative stance on many issues, combining right-wing sensationalism with a variety of stories, serials, comics, horoscopes, and opinion pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;
PETITJOURNALOPT;Seulement cinq centimes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VOMKRIEGE;\n\nA collection of General Clausewitz's theoretical military writings has been published posthumously by his widow, titled Vom Kriege - "On War." Quickly regarded as one of the masterpieces of military strategy, the work has brought a great deal of acclaim to the legacy of both the late General and the Prussian military in which he served. Clausewitz's theories meld statecraft and military tactics in a manner compared to Machiavelli's The Prince and the ancient Sun Tzu's Art of War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LABRADORINTERIOR;\n\nHenry Youle Hind, a geologist and explorer who has led multiple expeditions into the Red and Assiniboine River valleys in 1857, and in 1858, the Assiniboine, Souris, Qu'Appelle, and South Saskatchewan River valley, has conducted several new expeditions into the interior of the Labrador peninsula. The results of his survey of the land have been published in a two-volume report named "Explorations in the Interior of the Labrador Peninsula". Hind writes: "In the great interior valleys, some ten or fifteen miles from the coast, timber fit for building purposes and fuel exists in abundance, and the climate and soil admit of the successful cultivation of all common culinary vegetables. West of the Mingan Islands large areas exist suitable for settlement. Limestones and sandstones occupy the coast, and extend about ten miles back over a space of eighty miles on the Straits of Belle Isle, and great facilities exist in many other places for the establishment of permanent curing establishments.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
