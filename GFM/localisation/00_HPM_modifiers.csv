high_inflation_1;High Inflation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
high_inflation_1_desc;In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money - a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. A long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth. Inflation may also lead to an invisible tax in which the value of currency is lowered in contrast with its actual reserve, ultimately leading individuals to hold devalued legal tender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
