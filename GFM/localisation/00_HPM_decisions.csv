unlock_crisis_in_1870_desc;Old HPM standard was to unlock crisis as soon as someone researched Revolution & Counterrevolution.

dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;§RMay gain 0.5 infamy§! Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state - the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch's decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility - the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step - effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers - the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do - for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences - besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

first_annexiation_limburg_desc;With the end of the Austrian-led customs union known as German Confederation and the rise of a modern, intertwined German state, the duchy of Limburg became an outdated promise - one that was part of the defunct German Confederation. Limburg is internationally recognized as an integral part of the Netherlands but as the Germans set their eyes and ambitions on the complete unification of all German Confederation states, the duchy became a dangerous compromise. Several senior figures in $CAPITAL$ are preparing an order for the $MONARCHTITLE$ to sign, declaring the extinction of the old duchy of Limburg and its full integration in the Netherlands. The Germans, however, might try to protest this move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By supporting the manifesto, we can calm tension over the slavery issue domestically, but it might reduce our standing with the European Great Powers significantly. The Manifesto also proposes a shift in foreign policy, justifying the use of force to seize Cuba in the name of national security in case its owners are not willing to sell it to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

back_to_africa_act_title;Back to Africa Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
back_to_africa_act_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society was an early advocate of the idea of resettling $COUNTRY_ADJ$-born blacks in Africa. Founded in 1816, it was composed of two core groups: abolitionists and slave owners. Abolitionist members believed in freeing African slaves, along with their descendants, and providing them with the opportunity to return to Africa. Slave owning members believed free blacks endangered the system of slavery and sought to expel them from $COUNTRY$. Their efforts were ultimately fruitless as they didn't attract a significant numbers of colonizers. With the support of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, resettling won't be optional. By signing the "Back to Africa Act" we can fulfil their purpose, this time through the forceful repatriation of the Afro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ community in our core territories. It won't be fast and it will attract a lot of negative attention from around the international community, but we can continue on the work of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society in repatriating the African diaspora in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

meiji_daijokan_ordinances_title;The Daijokan Ordinances - Land Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
meiji_daijokan_ordinances_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government announced the reformation of the land taxation system in $YEAR$ as part of the Daijokan Ordinances in Japan. The government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system when the budget showed that collected taxes fell far below projected values. Private land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. The previous practice of land ownership was the Public Land Public Citizen Laws, which stated that all land was under the sole ownership of the emperor, such that individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English statute Quia Emptores enacted several centuries earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia's General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, its methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad.

colonization_of_fernando_po_desc;Fernando Pó is a strategically important island off the coast of West Africa. Its ideal position has made the island highly sought after by various European navies including the Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and also the British. Unfortunately, its ideal strategic position is still very much in the highly diseased equatorial zone that has earnt West Africa the nickname of 'The White Man's Grave'. Therefore many settlement attempts ended in failure. We ourselves abandoned the colony in 1827 and instead leased it to the United Kingdom for the purpose of serving as a forward base to patrol the West African slave trade. The British used the port on the North coast as their main base of operations. It was renamed Port Clarence in honor of the Duke of Clarence who became William IV. Despite diseases and other hardships, the Brits have actually seen success in reviving the colony. By simply revoking the lease we can re-acquire the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Captivated by the old tales of the Inca Empire, he's now organizing an expedition in order to search for the Inca capital, the Lost City of the Incas, founded by Mano Inca, their last emperor, and mentioned only in the old chronicles. We can contribute to this expedition and help him in his quest, by direct funding and by making sure our education spending is high. Finding the city will bring much renown to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientific community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Before the Zionist movement, some volunteers took up arms as part of a loosely organized watch known as Hashomer.

secularize_society_desc;In order to partake in the industries dealing with alcohol production and to properly compete with the Western powers in the field of science, a secularization of our society is of the utmost importance, some leading academics in our country advise. The separation of state and religion will certainly anger the conservation sectors in our society, but it will allows us to better face the challenges of this century. Once we take this decision, however, there's no going back, as the changes in our society will be so profound that their effects will linger in a way or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

option_disable_workplace_events_desc;A few province events related to the workplace, such as "The Old Man and the Sea", "All the Tea in PROVINCENAME" and "Blood and Iron Mine" can get quite spammy. I increased the MTTH and tried to balance it out, adding more requirements, but if you still find it spammy, you can use this option to completely disable them. Keep in mind that I didn't test balance with these events disabled or anything like this, and this might help improve performance a little bit. A few events that only trigger because you have no or low workplace safety standards are still in though. Pass workplace reforms if you want to get rid of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Other than the diagonal streets, all streets are on a rectangular grid and are numbered consecutively. The planned name for the new provincial capital is "La Plata" and with our approval, the new city will be ready in no time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

appoint_amir_kabir_desc;Amir Kabir Mirza Taghi Khan Farahani was chief minister to Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and one of the most capable and innovative figures to appear in the whole Qajar period. Son of the cook of a major statesman, he showed at a very young age his intelligence on all matters brought to him and was recompensed for it, rising to the highest positions of power. He remains a controversial historical figure: considered by some to be Iran's first reformer and wildly respected by liberal nationalists, he is seen as a modernizer who did great work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_petropolis_desc;Talks to be held in the Brazilian city of Petrópolis and initiated by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government aim to end tensions over the region known as Acre, claimed by multiple countries. Since we are the de facto owners of the province, we will be offering other countries monetary compensation, friendship treaties as well as the funding and construction of a railway in their territory in exchange for the peaceful settlement of this border issue. The proper demarcation of borders in the Amazon rainforest will also take place and hopefully this will be the final border issue between the involved parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_bogota_title;García Ortiz-Mangabeira Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_bogota_desc;Ever since the Brazilian declaration of independence, some our borders in the far north have not been delineated through international treaties. The ownership of several place in the amazon rainforest is not clear and claims proliferate, which can eventually lead to armed conflict. We lack a treaty with the Colombians delineating our borders and, while they are the de facto owners of the Marabitana province, old Portuguese forts and presence of Brazilian laborers looking for rubber in the region entitles us to ownership of the area. The Marabitana fort itself was founded by the Portuguese, though it fell in disrepair. We can send the resident minister Enéas Martins on a special mission to Bogotá, to meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alfredo Vásquez Cobo, to delineate a treaty with the Colombians that might give us Marabitanas. If they refuse our treaty, we will still have our claims, and we will have to enforce it through war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This era, known as the Zemene Mesafint or the 'Age of Princes', has warlords, regional princes, and noble houses vying with each other for power and control. They divided the Empire into personal fiefs and fought each other continuously. A puppet Emperor of the dynasty was enthroned in Gonder by one warlord, only to be dethroned and replaced by another member of the Imperial dynasty when a different warlord was able to seize Gonder and the reins of power. Regions such as Gojjam and Shewa were ruled by their own branches of the Imperial dynasty and, in Shewa, the local prince went as far as assuming the title of King. Now it's our time to try and seize the moment, to claim the title of King, to march on Gonder and all of Ethiopia and to try and bring an end to the infighting, to make Ethiopia whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The song marked the birth of the all-archipelago nationalist movement in Indonesia that supported the idea of one single 'Indonesia' rather than split into several colonies.

melayu_raya_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! 'Melayu Raya' is the name of the all-archipelago nationalist movement in South East Asia that supported the idea of one single country uniting the Malay people rather than split into several colonies. As such, it ambitioned the union of the East Indies, Dutch, British and Portuguese into a country strong enough to fight off western imperialism. The Pan-Malay union was based on understandings on similarities in race, shared language, religion and culture among ethnic groups. The ancient concept of Alam Melayu or Nusantara advocates an historical awareness that the territories were once united, to a degree, under native empires and, as such, could and should be brought together once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
devil_island_title;L'Ile du Diable;;;;;;;;;;;;;
devil_island_desc;Le Bagne de Cayenne, Devil's Island, was a famous prison of the 19th and 20th century which operated in the tropical colony of French Guiana. Opened in 1852, it was notorious for being used for internal exile of French political prisoners and the most hardened of thieves and murderers, but also for its harsh treatment - including diseases - of prisoners, deported here from all sides of the country. Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was; they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight. If the original sentence exceeded eight years, they were forced to stay as residents for the remainder of their lives and were provided land to settle on - helping populating the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's a philosophy aimed at uniting the very diverse peoples of the archipelago under a series of main banners, namely socialism, nationalism and religion, but also vague notions like justice, humanity, faith in representative democracy with no ethnic domination, welfare and monotheism.

closed_border_policy_title;Close the Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;
closed_border_policy_desc;A closed border is a border that prevents movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no exceptions associated with this movement. These borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened they generally only allow movement of people in exceptional circumstances. In case of emigration as well as immigrations, departing ships are inspected for illegal emigrants. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State's bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immigration_quota_policy_title;Implement Immigration Quotas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immigration_quota_policy_desc;A conditionally open border is a border that allows movement of people across the border that meet a special set of conditions. This special set of conditions which limits the application of border controls that would normally otherwise apply could be defined by an international agreement or international law, or the special conditions could be defined by a regulation or law of the jurisdiction that the people are claiming the right to enter. Conditionally open borders generally requires a claim to be submitted from the people who are proposing to enter the new jurisdiction stating why they meet the special conditions which allow entry into the new jurisdiction. In the case of our country, quotas mean that no foreigners that fail a literacy test in their own language or are nationals of countries that were or are at war with our nation are allowed. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State's bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
open_borders_policy_title;Abolish Immigration Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
open_borders_policy_desc;An open border is a border that enables free movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no restrictions on movement. A border may be an open border due to intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border, or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border. One of the advantages of such a policy is that it requires little to none effort from the State's bureaucracy to keep control over immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He bought vast plots in Chakvi, not far from Batumi, and dreamt of establishing massive plantations with internationally - competitive exports. In 1892, he travelled to China in order to study large-scale tea production. Popov hired a team of experienced workers from a factory in Canton, including an ambitious director named Lao Junzhou.

The Turkish government representatives say that the "amelioration of the lot of the minorities in Turkey" depended "above all on the exclusion of every kind of foreign intervention and of the possibility of provocation coming from outside". This could be achieved most effectively with an exchange, and "the best guarantees for the security and development of the minorities remaining" after the exchange "would be those supplied both by the laws of the country and by the liberal policy of Turkey with regard to all communities whose members have not deviated from their duty as Turkish citizens". An exchange would also be useful as a response to violence in the Balkans: "there were", in any event, "over a million Turks without food or shelter in countries in which neither Europe nor America took nor was willing to take any interest". The population exchange is seen as the best form of minority protection as well as "the most radical and humane remedy" of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
turkish_tea_title;Turkish Tea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
turkish_tea_desc;Turkish tea, called çay, is an important part of Turkish culture. Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality though tea is most often consumed in households, shops and mostly kiraathane, which is social congregation of Turkish men. Turkish tea is typically prepared using two stacked kettles called "çaydanlik" specially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep (infuse) several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. Despite the growing popularity of tea in $COUNTRY$, there are no tea producing provinces in our homeland. Now the microclimate region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea was identified by specialists as an ideal spot to start tea production, which will contribute to the task of fulfilling the growing demand for tea by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. However, this knowledge is kept largely a secret by the British and they are bound to be dissatisfied if we start our own tea production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bring_tea_to_iran_desc;After a failed attempt to cultivate tea in $COUNTRY$ in 1882 with seeds from India, Prince Mohammad Mirza known as "Kashef Al Saltaneh" who was born in Lahijan, imported Indian tea and started its cultivation in Lahijan. Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French labourer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavour only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

congo_mining_company_desc;Cheap copper has no terrors for the great Mid-African mines of the Mining Union of Upper Katanga, world's biggest producer... Elements in Katanga's strength are: tremendously rich ores, cheap native labour, big production of cobalt and radium (over 82%, of world radium supply) on the side and, most recent, the newly opened Benguela Railway, which connects Katanga with the Atlantic, saves hundreds of rail miles, thousands of nautical miles for Katanga copper on its long journey to European markets.\n\nA recent article published in a famous magazine talks about the riches of the Congo. Australian explorers found gold in the Angola river and the Ituri region, prospectors found diamonds in the Kananga region while copper, iron and other ores were found in Katanga. By founding a few mining companies such as the Mining Union of Upper Katanga, encouraging more exploration, settlement and exploitation of the Congo and by conceding incentives to the mining sector, both foreign and native, we will be able to better leverage profits out of the heart of the dark continent. We estimate a cost of §R100,000¤§W for this to be complete, and we will either pay this right now or owe it to the companies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Also, with China being so weak militarily and economically in the late 19th century, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leaders feared the rivalries of the Western powers could bring China to collapse, which would have profound implications on the security of $COUNTRY$. A prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officer recommended that $COUNTRY$ not only protect its line of sovereignty (shukensen) but also strive toward its line of advantage (riekisen), which meant that $COUNTRY$ should extend its influence and control beyond its national borders in order to ensure its security.

The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the centre by Mandalay Hill. The 1020-acre citadel was to be surrounded by four 2,032 m long walls and a moat 64 m wide, 4.6 m deep. At intervals of 169 m along the wall, turrets were built with gold-tipped spires for watchmen. The walls had three gates on each side, and five bridges to cross the moat. In addition, the king also commissioned the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein upasampada hall, the Thudamma "Good Dharma" zayats or public houses for preaching Buddhism and a library for the Pali Canon.

the_1854_plan_desc;Born into a lower-middle-class family in Lille, Louis Faidherbe is a sub-director of engineers in the colonies of Senegal. He plays a central role in the implementation of "The Plan of $YEAR$": a series of ministerial orders given to Governor Protet of Senegal that originated in petitions from the powerful Bourdeaux-based Maurel and Prom company, the largest shipping interest in Saint-Louis. The plan specified in detail the creation of forts along the Sénégal River to end African control of the acacia gum trade from the interior. Faidherbe's push to build fortifications farther out generated conflicts with Protet, and his protests to Paris over Protet's inaction quickly awarded him some sympathy in the government. If we were to appoint him to chief of battalion and then governor of the colony, we could quickly put the plan in action and take control of the coastal Wolof kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cheju_treaty_port_desc;The Cheju (or Jeju) island, south of Korea, lies in the Korea Strait between Japan and Korea. According to the local legend, three demigods emerged from Samsung which is said to have been on the northern slopes of Mt. Halla and became the progenitors of the Jeju people who founded the Kingdom of Tamna. During the Joseon Dynasty of Korea Jeju islanders were treated as foreigners and Jeju was considered as a place for horse breeding and exile for political prisoners. In the 17th Century, Injo of Joseon issued an edict prohibiting islanders from traveling to the Korean mainland. Despite the poverty, the Island would serve as a good base to exert influence over Korea and Japan and it's the place that's more likely to be ceded - the current owners don't care about it too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While ostensibly affirming the Finns' rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to "come within the scope of the general legislation of the empire". The main policies enacted were:\nThe conscription law, incorporating the Finnish army into the imperial army.\nThe Language Manifesto of $YEAR$ which made Russian the language of administration of Finland.\nThe Orthodox Russian Church was the church of state, including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of the Orthodox church to a Lutheran church service.\nThe Manifesto of $YEAR$ which asserted the imperial government's right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, including press censorship and restrictions of Russian currency and stamps as the only ones allowed.\nOur Finnish subjects will surely not like this and they might try to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

tasmania_penal_colony_desc;In 1803 the island south of Australia was colonized by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen's Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labour to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works. Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur. Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women's workhouse prison). There were five female factories in Van Diemen's Land. Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen's Land. Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.\n\nWe can abolish the penal colony and convert the island to a regular colony.

By supporting the draft proposal, we could calm tensions over the slavery issue for at least some time. The compromise is a package of five separate bills which will defuse a four-year political confrontation between slave and free states regarding the status of territories acquired during the Mexican-American War. The mains points are:\n1. Texas surrenders its claim to New Mexico, over which it had threatened war, as well as its claims north of the Missouri Compromise Line. It retains the Texas Panhandle and the federal government will took over the state's public debt.\n2. California is admitted as a free state with its current boundaries.\n3.The Wilmot Proviso will be fully rejected.\n4.The slave trade (but not slavery altogether) will be banned in Washington D.C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

conquer_conakry_desc;§RGain 1.5 infamy§! Since the 18th century, Portuguese, British and French traders had established small stations on the coast which was called Rivieres du Sud by the French. The Portuguese had trading stations at Rio Pongo and Rio Nunez, mostly for the purchase of enslaved Africans captured inland and brought to the coast. By 1820, British suppression of the slave trade and Portuguese imperial decline saw these posts abandoned, with British and French traders moving in. The French admiral Bouët-Willaumez made a number of treaties with coastal communities in the area (usually under the threat of force), and ensured Marseilles based trade houses exclusive access to the palm oil trade by the 1840s. Used for making soap, the palm oil trade was with Diola merchants who established markets in the interior, and transported it to the coastal stations. We can formalize the colonial structure of these trade posts and routes to effectively take control of Conakry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

shinbutsu_bunri_title;Adopt the Shinbutsu Bunri;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shinbutsu_bunri_desc;The Japanese term shinbutsu bunri indicates the separation of Shinto from Buddhism and therefore the separation of kami (native Shinto deities) from Buddhas (Buddhist deities), and of Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines (jinja). Until the end of the Edo period Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called shinbutsu-shugo, to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. The new government saw shinbutsu bunri as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism. A first order issued by the Jingijimuka on $YEAR$ ordered the defrocking of shaso and betto (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the Daijokan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as gongen to Japanese kami and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. Next came a ban on applying the Buddhist term Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic kami Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu and Usa Hachiman-gu shrines. In the final stage, all the defrocked betto and shaso were told to become "shrine priests" (kannushi) and return to their shrines and monks of the Nichiren sect were told not to refer to some deities as kami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality; however, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for an "emperor-centred" philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others. After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Emperor Meiji.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The treaty recognizes the territories of Johor (mainland), the Temenggung and his descendent's right to rule it, mutual protection and mutual recognitions of Pahang and Johor. With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire became two independent states, Johor and Pahang. Later, Pahang was fought over in a civil war between the two sons of the reigning Bendahara of Pahang.

In 1901 William Knox D'Arcy negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din: he would assume exclusive rights to prospect for 60 years in a vast tract of territory and in exchange the Shah received 20,000 pounds, an equal amount in shares, and a promise of future profits. In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000 pounds into their Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home." The geologist George Bernard Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after on May 26, 1908.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These continuing tensions between Mexico and us complicated our efforts to find a southern route for a transcontinental railroad as the only viable routes passed through Mexican territory. Attempting to defuse the situation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ sent James Gadsden, the new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Minister to Mexico, to negotiate with Santa Anna.

Besides, the islands did not have great strategic importance, as the United Kingdom would still maintain a strategic presence in the Mediterranean from the island of Malta.

The government invited farmers, soldiers and other immigrants from across the nation to promote the development of the wild land. The Kaitakushi also invited Horace Capron, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, to adopt overseas technology. The introduction of American technology helped advance both development and modernization, leading to the development of capital-intensive farming, the opening of coal mines and the construction of lumber mills, breweries and canneries that made use of local resources. With the construction and improvement of roads, ports and railways and the opening of the Seikan sea route between Honshu island (Aomori) and Hokkaido (Hakodate), urban areas will be formed throughout Hokkaido.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

abolish_los_fueros_desc;The relentless centralizing drive of the Spanish Crown led, after the end of the First Carlist War, to the reduction of the Basque institutional and legal system (called Fueros), but it was only after the last Carlist War that it was virtually wiped out. After the war, a new Spanish constitution was drawn up in order to establish a unitarian and central administration in Spain cut out according to a Spanish-Castilian pattern. Navarre was affected, but for the moment it was spared from further curtailments due to their 1841 "Compromise Act" (Ley Paccionada) that turned officially the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Navarre into another province of Spain. The Basques were forced to enrol in the Spanish military on an individual basis, and not in separate groups or corps, despite the fact that many Basques could hardly articulate a pair of phrases in Spanish, exposing them at best to stressful experiences. These changes allowed Spain to turn in a modern unified country, shaking off the last bits of the Ancien Régime, the first step to end the regionalism driving the forces behind the Carlists and Christinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

enslave_the_serfs_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. A lord of the manor could not sell his serfs. On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord, benefiting him with their long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them. But through their condition of near slavery, we can revoke more rights of the serfs and force them in total slavery, untying them from the land and tying them to the lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_pakistan_title;Form Pakistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered  the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was "a complete social order which affects all the activities in life" and "where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded". To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

integrate_uriankhai_title;The Annexation of Tannu Tuva;;;;;;;;;;;;;
integrate_uriankhai_desc;Lately, the Tannu Tuva economy has seriously deteriorated, resulting in the increasing poverty of its people. The causes were varied: declining number of fur-bearing animals probably due to over-hunting by both Uriankhais and Russians, declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia, and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which took a fearful toll on livestock herds. The end of Qing rule in Tannu Tuva brought chaos, bands of Uriankhai began plundering and burning Chinese shops. Uriankhai nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Uriankhai governor (amban-noyon), Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Uriankhai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colonize_uriankhai_title;Claim Uriankhai;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colonize_uriankhai_desc;After the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border by the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), the Qing inexplicably placed border guards south of the Tannu-ola Mountains separating Tannu Uriankhai from Outer Mongolia, not along the Sayan Mountains separating the region from Russia. During the 19th century, Russians began to settle in Tuva. The Qing Dynasty allowed Russians to settle providing that they lived in boats or tents. This historical basis and the Russian population living there provides us with an excuse to add the territory of Tannu Tuva to the Russian borders, and the founding of a new Russian city will only strengthen our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are calls for jihad by Muslim leaders like Maulana Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi and the millenarian Ahmedullah Shah, which were taken up by Muslims, particularly artisans, which caused the British to think that the Muslims were the main force behind this unrest. The Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, resisted these calls for jihad because, it has been suggested, he feared outbreaks of communal violence. By abiding to these calls, expelling the British from Delhi and declaring a Jihad, by shaking off the British influence and dominance, the Shah can be acclaimed Emperor of India, his rightful title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By establishing our dominance over these provinces, we can expel the Russian rulers and annex them back to the Ottoman Empire, centralizing rule and restoring order to these territories that belong in our empire.

The Viceroyalty later expanded to encompass the territories acquired by Russia in a series of wars with the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and the local Caucasian peoples.

The unification of Germany and its subsequent development into a Great Power considerably increased the military-strategic importance of the Estonian and Latvian territories which bordered the Baltic Sea, between the extensively autonomous Finland and the rebellious Poland-Lithuania. The security of the capital St Petersburg became a serious issue for the Russian Empire.

embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Boer farmers, paying compensation, abolishing Company rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Boers accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Following the opening of the Suez Canal, the trade routes shifted and we are now in a position to strike a deal with the western protectors of the Aceh: allow us a free hand within their sphere of influence in Maritime Southeast Asia while we also take the responsibility to fight piracy in the region.

expel_manchu_from_primorye_desc;The Pacific coast near Haishenwai was settled mainly by the Chinese and Manchus during the Qing Dynasty period. The Manchus banned Han Chinese from most of Manchuria including the Haishenwai area - it was only visited by illegal gatherers of sea cucumbers. Our claims on the area grew strong and we took the area, founded new settlements and renamed it. But the Manchus are still a majority in most of Outer Manchuria and we can't force them to assimilate. Our advisers recommend that we should try to throw them out so we can strengthen our claim in the area. Should we succeed in expelling them, we can greatly increase the region attractiveness to immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In 1840, France's then prime minister Adolphe Thiers had claimed that the river Rhine constituted the natural eastern border of the French nation, sparking what would later become known as the Rhine Crisis, as this was perceived in Germany as a threat to Prussian possessions on the western bank of the river. In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the 'Fatherland to remain calm', for, as the poem says, 'fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine', implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all aggression. The poem was put to music in 1854, and became extremely popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

peking_convention_TPG_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China. In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

austrian_form_south_german_confederation2_desc;While Germany was not united until the proclamation of the German Empire, following the Franco-Prussian war, rising nationalism in the 19th century had meant that unification had been on the cards long before that, with the Frankfurt assembly of 1848 being an important forerunner.

propose_danube_federation_desc;A new notion has arisen in our country -- one of extending the rights currently enjoyed by the Hungarians to the other Danubian cultures. We cannot, after all, expect that our nation will be able to peacefully continue on with two cultures dominating so many others.

portuguese_civil_code_title;Portuguese Civil Code;;;;;;;;;;;;;
portuguese_civil_code_desc;In 1867, the first Portuguese Civil Code was enacted. Professor Seabra, influenced by the Code Napoleon, wrote the whole Code alone. Other Codifications were also studied and taken into consideration, especially the Allgemeines Landrecht (Prussia), the ABGB (Austria) and the Sardinian Civil Code. But he was able to create a very peculiar style: the systematization is different from the French Code. The Portuguese Civil Code was unique for European civil codes, in its characterization of laws in terms of the person and property. It was divided into four sections: the person, the acquisition of goods, goods, and the defense of those goods or rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_simulambuko_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§! With the colonial powers of Europe having met at the Congo Conference to decide the orderly division of the African continent, pressure is mounting for Portugal to occupy the lands we have lain claim to.

treaty_of_paris_1898_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Spain has no choice but to admit it cannot hold onto its Caribbean and Pacific holdings. If we sit down and enter into peace negotiations with the Spanish government, it is possible they might be willing to end this war and turn over their holdings to us… for a price. Some will see this as the beginnings of American colonialism, but to our government this is simply a recognition of the world power that the United States has become.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_paris_1898_victory_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! We have been victorious in our war against Spain, and Cuba is now free. The Spanish government should realize it does not have the power to hold onto its North American and Pacific colonies. We should approach them and demand they turn over these colonies to us-- for, while it might indicate to some the beginnings of American colonialism, we feel these colonies are best entrusted to the care of a democratic Western power who has the power to hold them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
moret_law_title;The Moret Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;
moret_law_desc;The Moret Law granted freedom to slaves in Puerto Rico born after 1868, slaves who served in the Spanish Army, slaves over 60 years old, and slaves who were owned by the Spanish government.

claim_schleswig_title;Claim Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_schleswig_desc;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into Denmark proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favourably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mediate_belgian_independence_desc;While Belgium's de facto independence from The Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure by The Netherlands and technically a state of war still exists between the two nations. The idea has arisen that the British Empire should step in and mediate a settlement, demanding the Dutch give up their claims in return for guarantees of Belgian independence and control over Luxembourg. With the powers of Europe at the table, it seems unlikely the Dutch would refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hatt_i_humayun_title;Hatt-i Hümayun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hatt_i_humayun_desc;The Hatt-i Hümayun, or 'Imperial Reform Edict', will take the concept of Ottomanism-- the belief that equality among the Empire's religious groups will solve its social issues-- to the logical conclusion. Full rights will be granted to the Empire's minorities, and laws passed to grant each millet the right to use  the religious law of its population. This will go a long way towards dealing with some of the nationalist strife the country has suffered, and bring the Ottoman Empire into a new and multicultural age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Following the withdrawal of Napoleon's armies from Egypt Muhammad, through a long series of political maneuvering, came to be elected Wali (governor) of Ottoman Egypt, a position he would eventually use to secure Egypt as his own personal domain as Mamluk power waned. During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, European-style, state. Resistance to these reforms will slow down technological progress for a time, but the benefit to Egypt itself will be immeasurable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

tonghak_reforms_desc; The peasant class of Korea has suffered as of late under the corrupt officials of the current system. Currently the floods and famines that have taken its toll on the lands has hit them quite hard, with increased taxes current aristocrats and officials have put in place has brought the peasant classes to the point of revolution. In response to this, the government has instituted a number of social, economic and military reforms in order to placate the peasantry. The gwageo system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan's. Other social reforms were addressed as well: discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry. These reforms would legally change the traditional feudal system that had been followed for hundreds of years..;;;;;;;;;;;;;

annex_new_caledonia_desc;There is some interest within the French government of creating a penal colony -- somewhere that enemies of the monarchy could be sent, allowing them to be far away from the continent where they can do no harm. Admiral Febvrier Despointes reports that the island of New Caledonia, off the coast of Australia, might do just the trick.

plombieres_desc;The French Emperor Napoleon III is keen to settle the "Italian question" and to correct the humiliations of the 1815 Vienna Congress. He had long ago formed the view that this required a war against Austria, in his view, war with Austria could bring France military success, delivering glory to France and humiliation to Austria. \n\nThe prime-minister of Piedmont, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, aware of the French objectives believes there is an opportunity to serve these, while at the same time fulfilling his own by removing the burdensome yoke of Austrian repression from as many Italian citizens as possible. \n\nWe should propose a meeting with the French Emperor as soon as the opportunity arises;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He also sold the domain an ironclad warship and introduced a coal transportation railway in Nagasaki. His transactions were secretive, as they violated trade policies between Britain and Japan as well as Japanese law itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

iwakura_mission_title;Iwakura Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iwakura_mission_desc;The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy was a Japanese diplomatic journey around the world, initiated in $YEAR$ by the oligarchs of the Meiji period. Although it was not the only such "mission", it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck and was probably based on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To renegotiate the unequal treaties with the Great Powers that Japan had been forced into during the previous decades and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to effect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
meiji_constitution_title;Meiji Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
meiji_constitution_desc;After an exhaustive study of western democratic methods, Japanese scholars have settled on a method of government where the Emperor will preside over an Imperial Diet, elected by the people and yet preserving both Imperial power as well as our traditions. This, they believe, is the best way for Japan to move forward into the modern era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shogunate_constitution_title;Tokugawa Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shogunate_constitution_desc;In order for the Tokugawa's rule to survive past this civil unrest, it is necessary to overhaul the Japanese government. Per the Tokugawa Constitution, the Shogun will preside over the Japanese people and dictate large-scale domestic, military and foreign policy. Meanwhile, as a concession to Imperial sympathizers, the Emperor will gain an official leadership role as the speaker of the new Japanese parliament, the Council of Elders, elected by the people's vote. Former daimyos and Imperial court administrators will retain their status by becomig members of the new nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

abandon_dentoudou_desc;Needless reverence for our old traditions has hampered our ability for our nation to progress. It is time to move into the future and cast aside the parts of our culture that continue to make us lag behind the West.

begin_line_of_advantage_title;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
begin_line_of_advantage_desc;The concept of riekisen, or the 'line of advantage', means that we must extend Japanese influence beyond our national borders in order to ensure our security. This means turning all of the Japanese military, and indeed our people, to the notion of foreign conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
refuse_line_of_advantage_title;The Path of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
refuse_line_of_advantage_desc;Instead of focusing on military might and conquest, Japanese security must be provided by devotion to technological progress and reform. We must match the Western powers, and quickly, or they will surely take advantage and find Japan sorely unprepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_korea_title;Annex Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_korea_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Preserving the independence of Korea is too costly. If the 'line of advantage' is to be maintained, we must push our borders well beyond their current sphere. Korea must be turned into a protectorate of the Empire, for its own good as well as ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_korea_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! With Korea under foreign rule, our nation feels threatened. The 'line of advantage' means that protecting our borders means extending our influence beyond them, and thus we must move to claim the Korean peninsula and wrest it from those who hold it in their grasp -- in the name of Korean freedom, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

order_to_expel_barbarians_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the role of the Emperor has been confined to that of figurehead. We lead Japan, yet we do not. Recently, the leadership of the Shogun has come into question. His increasing inability to deal with foreigners in a way that shows any manner of leadership compels the Emperor to act -- with or without the Shogun's permission. We shall send out a call to the people in our own name, demanding they rise up and throw out the foreigners that the Shogun will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peace_with_the_emperor_title;Peace With the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peace_with_the_emperor_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the Emperor has remained a figurehead. Even so, he is a leader of the Japanese people and, at times, has expressed dissatisfaction with our own position as ruler of Japan. This has caused conflict, and should we reach a point where our positions are not so different -- and, indeed, the Emperor is satisfied with our ability to rule, perhaps we can bring this conflict to an end once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ansei_harris_treaty_desc;After Commodore Perry's voyage to Japan, trade relations between Japan and the United States were established at gunpoint.

french_japan_unequal_treaty_desc;We now have a stronghold in continental Asia, which means we can join the power struggle between the Western powers and local Asian countries.

overthrow_the_bakufu_desc;The time has come to restore Emperor Meiji to power. For too long has the imperial court been forced to remain but a figurehead, with central authority remaining with the tyrannical Tokugawa clan. Japan must have one ruler, an Emperor that can lead the nation into the future. Let us send our forces to Kyoto, to seize the imperial palace and set the coup in motion.\n\n§RNOTE: To win this war, you must occupy Edo or White Peace with the Shogun.

abolish_the_han_system_title;Abolish the Han System;;;;;;;;;;;;;
abolish_the_han_system_desc;The han system, under which the daimyo rule as feudal lords with very little central authority remaining to the government, is an antiquated relic that must be eliminated. The domains shall be replaced with prefectures, and the daimyos given roles as governors and bureaucrats. There will be resistance, but all will come to understand that this is for the greater good of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_japan_title;Bunmei Kaika;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_japan_desc;With the embracing of Western ideas and authority slowly falling away from the shogunate, the government will naturally pass first to the imperial court-- and eventually, with the extension of voting privileges to the landowners, to the Japanese people themselves.

By operating deep inside Free American territory, and by destroying much of the north's civilian infrastructure, Sherman is often said to have broken the North's will to fight.

france_protector_of_eastern_christians_desc;Up until now, the Russians have maintained sovereign authority over Christians in the Holy Land -- authority that rightfully belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. It is time for that to change. Furthermore, the Holy Lands can be a way of reuniting France after the political divisions of 1848-49. The revolutionary left can be reconciled if it was engaged in a patriotic fight for liberty against the 'gendarme of Europe,' and the Catholic right had long been pressing for a crusade against Orthodoxy that to them threatened Christendom and French civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

self_strengthening_movement_desc;The Self-Strengtening Movement was a period of institutional reforms initiated in China during the late Qing dynasty following a series of military defeats and concessions to foreign powers. \n\n The majority of the ruling elite still subscribed to a conservative Confucian worldview, but following China's serious defeats in the First and Second Opium Wars, several officials now argued that in order to strengthen itself against the West, it was necessary to adopt Western military technology and armaments. This could be achieved by establishing shipyards and arsenals, and by hiring foreign advisers to train Chinese artisans to manufacture such wares in China. As such, the "self-strengtheners" were by and large uninterested in any social reform beyond the scope of economic and military modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

option_disable_mobilization_bug_desc;There's a vanilla bug that happens when a country that is mobilizing is annexed, which results in the country having "ghost units" - units in exile that belong to a country that doesn't exist. This creates problems with pops and screws with unit visibility, so HPM has a fix: when the AI detects the problem, they will give a random province to the country that has the ghost units until it de-mobilize. This happens around 10 times during a game and the country that demobilizes exists for around 10 days, then it's reabsorbed like nothing happened. This shouldn't cause any problems during a normal game, but if for some reason you'd rather not have the bugfix, this option will disable it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Some of the prominent Czech intellectuals have started to promote the idea of Austro-Slavism in opposition to Russian Pan-Slavism. Considering our current population maps and dwindling empire, it is clear what we should do: embrace the Slavic character of our Empire, emphasise our Catholic tradition and prevent interslavic squabbles through neutral Habsburg German rule.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,five_year_plan_title;Five-year plan;
five_year_plan_desc;The Five-year plan was a list of economic goals, created by Communist Party General Secretary Joseph Stalin, based on his policy of Socialism in One Country. The plan was implemented in 1928 and took effect until 1932. The Soviet Union entered a series of five-year plans which began in 1928 under the rule of Joseph Stalin. Stalin launched what would later be referred to as a "revolution from above" to improve the Soviet Union's domestic policy. The policies were centered around rapid industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. Stalin desired to remove and replace any policies created under the New Economic Policy. The plan, overall, was to transition the Soviet Union from a weak, poorly controlled, agriculture state, into an industrial powerhouse. While the vision was grand, its planning was ineffective and unrealistic given the short amount of time given to meet the desired goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1512058;The question of internal organisation was important in the new kolkhozes. The most basic measure was to divide the workforce into a number of groups, generally known as brigades, for working purposes. It was already normal practice for the large kolkhoz of 200-400 households to be divided into temporary or permanent work units of 15-30 households.' The authorities gradually came down in favour of the fixed, combined brigade, that is the brigade with its personnel, land, equipment and draught horses fixed to it for the whole period of agricultural operations, and taking responsibility for all relevant tasks during that period. The brigade was headed by a brigade leader. This was usually a local man (a few were women).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
collectivise_farms_title;Implement Collectivisation in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Agricultural Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;
collectivise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of "socialist agriculture of the highest order". Kolkhozes, or collective farms, were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organised by the state on land confiscated from former large estates (so-called "state reserve land" that was left over after distribution of land to individuals) and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We can use the law to sieze some of the merchant ships for our military operations at the expense of greater import costs as there are now less merchant ships to deliver goods to our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

dai_nam_desc;Our kingdom unoficially goes by many names due to the need for us reconcile our nationalism with our duty to show humility toward our suzerain masters, the Chinese. The name "Viet Nam" was a compromise agreed upon by King Nguyen Phuc An and the Jiaqing Emperor in 1802, since the name we truly desired to take on, Nam Viet, was seen as defiant toward China. This is because Nam Viet is also the Vietnamese translation of Nanyue, an ancient Chinese vassal state comprising most of Vietnam as well as Canton, Kwangsi, and Hainan. But times have changed. It is better for us to show that we can stand on our own two feet and proclaim an even nobler name for our kingdom: Dai Nam, or "Great South.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Additionally, Japan continues to appear alien to Westerners, continuing to reject the virtues of their society and the advantages they have over some of the less desirable elements of our traditional culture. It is time for this to change. Japan will commit fully to continuous revolutionization of its society in the name of cementing the Japanese people's place in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_puna_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! Ever since the integration of Antofagasta into $COUNTRY$ and our occupation of San Pedro de Atacama, the Puna de Atacama, an arid plateau, has not had any clear border demarcation. The region contains settlers from both $COUNTRY$ and Argentina, and it contains large deposits of iron, copper, saltpeter and more. It is time that we lay claim to this rightful extension of our territory so none can deny us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

propose_buchanan_desc;Ever since the Chilean occupation of San Pedro de Atacama, they have laid claim over all of the Puna de Atacama, a large, arid plateau. This claim overlaps with ours on the region, and this could potentially end in war. If we want to prevent a conflict and establish definitive borders, we must subject the dispute to international mediation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

national_territories_chaco_desc;Law No. 1532 of National Territories enacted on October 16, 1884, which created the jurisdictions of all the national territories of the country, established the division of the national territory of the Gran Chaco, into two national territories or governorates: National Territory of Formosa and National Territory of the Chaco.\n§YNOTE: This will turn all your holdings in the Chaco into colonies, and will therefore erase any effects.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

may_pacts_title;Pactos de Mayo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
may_pacts_desc;The Pacts of May (Pactos de Mayo in Spanish) are a series of proposed protocols to sign between $COUNTRY$ and Argentina. The protocols state that Argentina must renounce the ability to intervene in the Chilean affairs in the Pacific Ocean, that both countries will sell off any warship being constructed in Europe and that both governments will work together to peacefully fix their border disputes in the southern Andes. By proposing this pact to the Argentinians, we will finally be able to solve our territorial disputes, even if it might mean renouncing some territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modernize_navy_title;Modernization of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Navy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modernize_navy_desc;Following recent wars involving our naval forces, it has been proving that our ships are falling behind as steamers, ironclads, monitors and torpedo boats become all the more prominent. To keep up with current naval technology, it has been proposed we purchase several modern vessels from the United Kingdom, and that we establish a proper naval school in our nation to properly train navy officers. However, this all might prove rather costly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sarmiento_school_reforms_title;Domingo Sarmiento's School Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sarmiento_school_reforms_desc;Following the first ever census in $COUNTRY$, it has come to our attention that an incredibly small amount of our population can properly read, with the majority being illiterate. President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento has proposed we begin constructing schools and overall increasing government subsidies to education, in an attempt to better educate the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaco_boreal_conquest_title;Conquest of the Chaco Boreal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaco_boreal_conquest_desc;The Chaco Boreal region has largely remained in native hands until now. It's time to pacify this region and expand our borders, we need to claim this land so no one can deny it from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
puerto_suarez_title;The Foundation of Puerto Suárez;;;;;;;;;;;;;
puerto_suarez_desc;Our frontier with the Gran Chaco and its fierce native population has never truly been pacified, and the Guarani tribes inhabiting our claims have managed to resist our advances. However, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ explorer Miguel Suárez Arana has gone on an expedition to the region with the objective to establish a settlement on the right bank of the Paraguay river. With these advances, the frontier of the Chaco will finally be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

decoud_quijarro_treaty_desc;Our border dispute with Paraguay in the chaco has gone on for too long. With the final occupation of the last native territories in the region, we must properly set our borders. By sending $COUNTRY_ADJ$ minister Antonio Quijarro to Asunción, we can finally draw a proper border line between both nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mines_lategame_per_title;Mines in Eastern Persia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mines_lategame_per_desc;It has been known for now years that deposits of iron and coal exist on the east of our country, but they are difficult to access. Years ago, we didn't have the technology nor money to invert on the deposits, but with our recent westernization and our industrial status, the deposits are now both economically and industrially positive, as our industry craves for raw materials and the present technology makes it cheaper for us to exploit them. It would give huge wealth to our country, and a good international and trade position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
neues_museum_berlin_title;Das Neue Museum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
neues_museum_berlin_desc;Today Friedrich August Stüler, a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, a famous city planner, proposed to build a new museum in the center of Berlin. The Neues Museum would be the second museum to be built on the Museum Island and is intended as an extension to house collections which can't be accommodated in the Altes Museum. Among these there are collections of plaster casts, ancient Egyptian artifacts, the prehistoric and early historic collections, the ethnographic collection, and the collection of prints and drawings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

execute_romanov_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! The Romanovs have brought pain to our population and glorious proletariat for centuries--but now, they have been overthrown by our revolution to bring our communist utopia into existence. The family has been exiled to Yekaterinburg, near the Ural Mountains, and a batallion of our great Red Army occupies the royal palace. In the commandant's office, they are already assigning victims to each killer before distributing the handguns. The execution is planned this night, while the Romanovs will be having dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEADROMANOV;"The prisoners were told to wait in the cellar room while the truck that would transport them was being brought to the House. A few minutes later, an execution squad of secret police was brought in and Yurovsky read aloud the order given to him by the Ural Executive Committee: Nikolai Alexandrovich, in view of the fact that your relatives are continuing their attack on Soviet Russia, the Ural Executive Committee has decided to execute you."\n\nThe Russian Imperial Romanov family (Nicholas II of Russia, his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, and their five children: Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Alexei) have been shot and bayoneted to death today by Bolshevik revolutionaries under Yakov Yurovsky on the orders of the Ural Regional Soviet in Yekaterinburg. This night have been also murdered members of the imperial entourage who had accompanied them: court physician Eugene Botkin, lady-in-waiting Anna Demidova, footman Alexei Trupp, and head cook Ivan Kharitonov. The bodies have been taken then to the Koptyaki forest, where they have been stripped, buried, and mutilated with grenades to prevent identification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
demand_israeli_independence_title;Demand Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
demand_israeli_independence_desc;The tensions between Jews and Arabs in the Land of Israel have festered for too long, and our colonial overlords have failed again and again to stop the violence from claiming lives in the Jewish community. This cannot continue. We will never achieve our dream of establishing the Jewish state with the Land of Israel being ruled as a colonial mandate. We are fully capable of ruling ourselves. If the Mandatory government will not protect us, we will demand our independence. If they refuse, we will take up arms against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_arabs_title;Accept the Arabs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_arabs_desc;Never have Zionists asserted that non-Jews cannot be allowed to live equally in the Jewish state. For us to continue living in the land of Israel peacefully means coming to terms with a clear truth: that the Arabs who live here today cannot all be faulted for our mistreatment and expulsion in the past. It's time to be bold and reimagine our country not just as the Nation of the Jews, but a multiethnic confederation for whom the land each has value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
taiwan_sugar_plantations_title;Sugar Industry in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
taiwan_sugar_plantations_desc;Sugarcane is a foreign crop to Taiwan, previously used as an important export during Dutch colonial rule. With domestic and international demand for sugar being always high, however, it is tempting to reintroduce sugar to the island and reap its profits. We will need to also set up a rail system able to transport harvested sugarcane to the island's ports.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
saipan_sugar_plantations_title;Sugar Industry in Saipan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
saipan_sugar_plantations_desc;Saipan is far from a profitable territory, despite its strategic importance in the Pacific. Nevertheless, its lush grasslands' agricultural potential cannot be understated. And what better cash crop to introduce to this impoverished island than sugar?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
declare_hebrew_national_language_title;Declare Hebrew the National Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;
declare_hebrew_national_language_desc;Hebrew has survived past its death as a spoken language by being the main language of Jewish prayer and the language of a large body of Jewish scholarship. However, Hebrew has been rapidly re-emerging from the ashes as a language spoken day-to-day by the citizens of the fledgling Jewish state. This miracle is courtesy of intellectuals continuing the Hebrew literary tradition, most notably linguist Eliezer Ben Yehuda, who compiled a modern Hebrew dictionary replete with his own coined words. How could we not declare our ancestral tongue as the revived Jewish nation's official language?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Real Audiencia of Charcas (now known as Bolivia) was a region that was ruled under the Viceroyalty of Peru for most of the imperal era until 1776, after which it was transferred to Buenos Aires which administered it up to independence. Even though Bolivia is closer to Peru than it is to us, we can now take the opportunity to secure our position as the successor of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata and reclaim the Charcas as ours by any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
