dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;§RMay gain 0.5 infamy§! Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state - the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councilors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch's decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility - the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step - effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers - the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do - for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences - besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The project was initiated after a period of rapid urban growth and development, as the old city center of Paris had proven itself incapable of meeting the infrastructure demands of a growing city.

Limburg is internationally recognized as an integral part of the Netherlands but as the Germans set their eyes and ambitions on the complete unification of all German Confederation states, the duchy became a dangerous compromise. Several senior figures in $CAPITAL$ are preparing an order for the $MONARCHTITLE$ to sign, declaring the extinction of the old duchy of Limburg and its full integration in the Netherlands.

back_to_africa_act_title;Back to Africa Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
back_to_africa_act_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society was an early advocate of the idea of resettling $COUNTRY_ADJ$-born blacks in Africa. Founded in 1816, it was composed of two core groups: abolitionists and slave owners. Abolitionist members believed in freeing African slaves, along with their descendants, and providing them with the opportunity to return to Africa. Slave owning members believed free blacks endangered the system of slavery and sought to expel them from $COUNTRY$. Their efforts were ultimately fruitless as they didn't attract a significant numbers of colonizers. With the support of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, resettling won't be optional. By signing the "Back to Africa Act" we can fulfill their purpose, this time through the forceful repatriation of the Afro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ community in our core territories. It won't be fast and it will attract a lot of negative attention from around the international community, but we can continue on the work of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization Society in repatriating the African diaspora in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

meiji_daijokan_ordinances_title;The Daijokan Ordinances - Land Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
meiji_daijokan_ordinances_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government announced the reformation of the land taxation system in $YEAR$ as part of the Daijokan Ordinances in Japan. The government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system when the budget showed that collected taxes fell far below projected values. Private land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. The previous practice of land ownership was the Public Land Public Citizen Laws, which stated that all land was under the sole ownership of the emperor, such that individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English statute Quia Emptores enacted several centuries earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia's General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, its methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad.

authorize_bulgarian_exarchate_desc;In order to combat the growing threat of Bulgarian nationalism, we can give the Bulgarian dioceses the right to organize an Exarchate within Ottoman territory. Nominally, Bulgarian Orthodox Christians are loyal to the Orthodox Patriarch in Constantinople, but the idea of an Exarchate of their own would help soothe their nationalist angst. This Exarchate would be made without the blessing of the Patriarch of Constantinople, so it would also introduce ethno-nationalist tensions in Christians in our Balkan lands which would help in sowing disorder and distrust among Christians in our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

colonization_of_fernando_po_title;Revoke the lease of Fernando Pó;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colonization_of_fernando_po_desc;Fernando Pó is a strategically important island off the coast of West Africa. Its ideal position has made the island highly sought after by various European navies including the Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and also the British. Unfortunately, its ideal strategic position is still very much in the highly diseased equatorial zone that has earnt West Africa the nickname of 'The White Man's Grave'. Therefore many settlement attempts ended in failure. We ourselves abandoned the colony in 1827 and instead leased it to the United Kingdom for the purpose of serving as a forward base to patrol the West African slave trade. The British used the port on the North coast as their main base of operations. It was renamed Port Clarence in honor of the Duke of Clarence who became William IV. Despite diseases and other hardships, the Brits have actually seen success in reviving the colony. By simply revoking the lease we can re-acquire the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus the gay-colored dress of the southern Persian, the saffron-stained vest of Oman, the white robe of Nejd, and the striped gown of Baghdad, are often to be seen mingling with the light garments of Bahreyn, its blue and red turban, its white silk-fringed cloth worn Banian fashion round the waist, and its frock-like overall: while a small but unmistakable colony of Indians, merchants by profession, and mainly from Gujarat, Cutch, and their vicinity, keep up here all their peculiarities of costume and manner, and live among the motley crowd, 'among them, but not of them'. The cities of Bahrain and Doha lie on a crucial trade routes to India and thus enjoy a manner of riches, provisions and prosperity from trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

support_french_foreign_legion_desc;'La Légion Étrangere', known in English as 'The Foreign Legion', is a military unit of the French army, with a unique distinction in that it accepts its recruits regardless of their national and personal backgrounds.

The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century.

luderitz_expedition_desc;First discovered in 1487 by the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias, the small coastal area known as Angra Pequena was made into a trading station by German trader Adolf Lüderitz in 1883. He concluded treaties with the neighboring chiefs, buying large tracts of land for a total sum of 560 pounds sterling's and 260 rifles. The new land was then named "Lüderitzland". Lüderitz has plans to send expeditions further north, in the place the natives call Otjozondjii, known in German as Swakopmund but under the belief that a Great Power was about to claim the area as a protectorate, Lüderitz stalled his plans and asked for the protection of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government in $YEAR$.

The Marabitana fort itself was founded by the Portuguese, though it fell in disrepair. We can send the resident minister Enéas Martins on a special mission to Bogotá, to meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alfredo Vásquez Cobo, to delineate a treaty with the Colombians that might give us Marabitanas.

The ancient concept of Alam Melayu or Nusantara advocates an historical awareness that the territories were once united, to a degree, under native empires and, as such, could and should be brought together once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
devil_island_title;L'Ile du Diable;;;;;;;;;;;;;
devil_island_desc;Le Bagne de Cayenne, Devil's Island, was a famous prison of the 19th and 20th century which operated in the tropical colony of French Guiana. Opened in 1852, it was notorious for being used for internal exile of French political prisoners and the most hardened of thieves and murderers, but also for its harsh treatment - including diseases - of prisoners, deported here from all sides of the country. Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was; they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight. If the original sentence exceeded eight years, they were forced to stay as residents for the remainder of their lives and were provided land to settle on - helping populating the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;
pancasila_title;Enact the Pancasila!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pancasila_desc;Pancasila is the official philosophical foundation of the Indonesian state. The word consists of two Old Javanese parts: "pañca" meaning five, and "sila" meaning principles. It comprises five principles held to be inseparable and interrelated: belief in the one and only God, just and civilized humanity, the unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by the inner wisdom in the unanimity arising out of deliberations amongst representatives, social justice for all of the people of Indonesia. It's a philosophy aimed at uniting the very diverse peoples of the archipelago under a series of main banners, namely socialism, nationalism and religion, but also vague notions like justice, humanity, faith in representative democracy with no ethnic domination, welfare and monotheism. It's gonna be hard but we can make it work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

closed_border_policy_title;Close the Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;
closed_border_policy_desc;A closed border is a border that prevents movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no exceptions associated with this movement. These borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened they generally only allow movement of people in exceptional circumstances. In case of emigration as well as immigrations, departing ships are inspected for illegal emigrants. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State's bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immigration_quota_policy_title;Implement Immigration Quotas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immigration_quota_policy_desc;A conditionally open border is a border that allows movement of people across the border that meet a special set of conditions. This special set of conditions which limits the application of border controls that would normally otherwise apply could be defined by an international agreement or international law, or the special conditions could be defined by a regulation or law of the jurisdiction that the people are claiming the right to enter. Conditionally open borders generally requires a claim to be submitted from the people who are proposing to enter the new jurisdiction stating why they meet the special conditions which allow entry into the new jurisdiction. In the case of our country, quotas mean that no foreigners that fail a literacy test in their own language or are nationals of countries that were or are at war with our nation are allowed. These controls and checks come at the cost of an increased demand from the State's bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
open_borders_policy_title;Abolish Immigration Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
open_borders_policy_desc;An open border is a border that enables free movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no restrictions on movement. A border may be an open border due to intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border, or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border. One of the advantages of such a policy is that it requires little to none effort from the State's bureaucracy to keep control over immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He bought vast plots in Chakvi, not far from Batumi, and dreamt of establishing massive plantations with internationally - competitive exports. In 1892, he traveled to China in order to study large-scale tea production. Popov hired a team of experienced workers from a factory in Canton, including an ambitious director named Lao Junzhou.

This could be achieved most effectively with an exchange, and "the best guarantees for the security and development of the minorities remaining" after the exchange "would be those supplied both by the laws of the country and by the liberal policy of Turkey with regard to all communities whose members have not deviated from their duty as Turkish citizens". An exchange would also be useful as a response to violence in the Balkans: "there were", in any event, "over a million Turks without food or shelter in countries in which neither Europe nor America took nor was willing to take any interest". The population exchange is seen as the best form of minority protection as well as "the most radical and humane remedy" of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
turkish_tea_title;Turkish Tea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
turkish_tea_desc;Turkish tea, called çay, is an important part of Turkish culture and offering tea to guests is standard practice. It is most often consumed in households, shops and kiraathane (tea houses primarily for men). Its typical method of preparation involves using two stacked kettles called "çaydanlik" specifically designed for the brewing of tea. Water is first brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle. Then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top, where several spoonfuls of loose tea leaves are steeped, making the resulting tea very strong. Despite the growing popularity of tea among Turks, there are no tea producing provinces in Anatolia or the Balkans. Now, however, a climatologically suitable region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea has been identified by specialists as an ideal spot to begin tea production. Establishing our own tea plantations would go a long way towards fulfilling the growing demand for tea of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. However, the British are bound to be dissatisfied, as their sales would decline if we were to start growing our own tea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French labourer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavor only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Australian explorers found gold in the Angola river and the Ituri region, prospectors found diamonds in the Kananga region while copper, iron and other ores were found in Katanga. By founding a few mining companies such as the Mining Union of Upper Katanga, encouraging more exploration, settlement and exploitation of the Congo and by conceding incentives to the mining sector, both foreign and native, we will be able to better leverage profits out of the heart of the dark continent.

The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery.

switch_to_japanese_tech_school_desc;$COUNTRY$'s militaristic attitude intensified as government leaders recognized the need to ensure the defense of the country against Russia and other Western powers. Observing the advanced technological achievements and superior military and naval power of the West, $COUNTRY$ had fears of being invaded by a Western country such as Russia. Also, with China being so weak militarily and economically in the late 19th century, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leaders feared the rivalries of the Western powers could bring China to collapse, which would have profound implications on the security of $COUNTRY$. A prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officer recommended that $COUNTRY$ not only protect its line of sovereignty (shukensen) but also strive toward its line of advantage (riekisen), which meant that $COUNTRY$ should extend its influence and control beyond its national borders in order to ensure its security. He advocates expansionism more for security reasons rather than for conquest as an end in itself or for other reasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The new capital city site was 66 km2 in area, surrounded by four rivers. The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the center by Mandalay Hill. The 1020-acre citadel was to be surrounded by four 2,032 m long walls and a moat 64 m wide, 4.6 m deep. At intervals of 169 m along the wall, turrets were built with gold-tipped spires for watchmen. The walls had three gates on each side, and five bridges to cross the moat. In addition, the king also commissioned the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein upasampada hall, the Thudamma "Good Dharma" zayats or public houses for preaching Buddhism and a library for the Pali Canon. The former royal palace of Amarapura was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay.

The plan specified in detail the creation of forts along the Sénégal River to end African control of the acacia gum trade from the interior. Faidherbe's push to build fortifications farther out generated conflicts with Protet, and his protests to Paris over Protet's inaction quickly awarded him some sympathy in the government.

Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.\n\nWe can abolish the penal colony and convert the island to a regular colony. Changing the name to Tasmania from Van Diemen's Land should help our government to clear a little bit of the stigma that the island has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1850_compromise_title;The $YEAR$ Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1850_compromise_desc;Senators Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas have presented a draft proposal for a compromise on the slavery issue centered around the premise of popular sovereignty as the determinant for slavery or abolitionism in the territories. By supporting the draft proposal, we could calm tensions over the slavery issue for at least some time. The compromise is a package of five separate bills which will defuse a four-year political confrontation between slave and free states regarding the status of territories acquired during the Mexican-American War. The mains points are:\n1. Texas surrenders its claim to New Mexico, over which it had threatened war, as well as its claims north of the Missouri Compromise Line. It retains the Texas Panhandle and the federal government will took over the state's public debt.\n2. California is admitted as a free state with its current boundaries.\n3.The Wilmot Proviso will be fully rejected.\n4.The slave trade (but not slavery altogether) will be banned in Washington D.C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

conquer_conakry_desc;§RGain 1.5 infamy§! Since the 18th century, Portuguese, British and French traders had established small stations on the coast which was called Rivieres du Sud by the French. The Portuguese had trading stations at Rio Pongo and Rio Nunez, mostly for the purchase of enslaved Africans captured inland and brought to the coast. By 1820, British suppression of the slave trade and Portuguese imperial decline saw these posts abandoned, with British and French traders moving in. The French admiral Bouët-Willaumez made a number of treaties with coastal communities in the area (usually under the threat of force), and ensured Marseilles based trade houses exclusive access to the palm oil trade by the 1840s. Used for making soap, the palm oil trade was with Diola merchants who established markets in the interior, and transported it to the coastal stations. We can formalize the colonial structure of these trade posts and routes to effectively take control of Conakry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

senegal_gambia_border_treaty_desc;A dispute arose with another country over our colonial borders in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. Citizens poured and live in Ziguinchor province. According to the principles of Effective Occupation established in Conference of Berlin, the territory belong to us. But it has been under rule of another nation for a long time and thus the dispute arose. Our diplomats are trying to organize an exchange - Gabu for Ziguinchor, or at least an indemnity in exchange for the province, now we just need to propose this deal to our good neighbors. If we don't have territory to exchange, we will have to pay §R200,000¤§W for our purchases, up front or in installments, if the deal proceeds.

shinbutsu_bunri_title;Adopt the Shinbutsu Bunri;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shinbutsu_bunri_desc;The Japanese term shinbutsu bunri indicates the separation of Shinto from Buddhism and therefore the separation of kami (native Shinto deities) from Buddhas (Buddhist deities), and of Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines (jinja). Until the end of the Edo period Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called shinbutsu-shugo, to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. The new government saw shinbutsu bunri as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism. A first order issued by the Jingijimuka on $YEAR$ ordered the defrocking of shaso and betto (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the Daijokan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as gongen to Japanese kami and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. Next came a ban on applying the Buddhist term Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic kami Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu and Usa Hachiman-gu shrines. In the final stage, all the defrocked betto and shaso were told to become "shrine priests" (kannushi) and return to their shrines and monks of the Nichiren sect were told not to refer to some deities as kami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
imperial_rescript_title;The Imperial Rescript on Education;;;;;;;;;;;;;
imperial_rescript_desc;Following the Meiji Restoration, the leadership of the Meiji government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centered on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality; however, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for an "emperor-centered" philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others. After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Emperor Mutsuhito.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The treaty recognizes the territories of Johor (mainland), the Temenggung and his descendant's right to rule it, mutual protection and mutual recognitions of Pahang and Johor. With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire became two independent states, Johor and Pahang. Later, Pahang was fought over in a civil war between the two sons of the reigning Bendahara of Pahang.

In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000 pounds into their Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home."

The introduction of American technology helped advance both development and modernization, leading to the development of capital-intensive farming, the opening of coal mines and the construction of lumber mills, breweries and canneries that made use of local resources.

abolish_los_fueros_desc;The relentless centralizing drive of the Spanish Crown led, after the end of the First Carlist War, to the reduction of the Basque institutional and legal system (called Fueros), but it was only after the last Carlist War that it was virtually wiped out. After the war, a new Spanish constitution was drawn up in order to establish a unitarian and central administration in Spain cut out according to a Spanish-Castilian pattern. Navarre was affected, but for the moment it was spared from further curtailments due to their 1841 "Compromise Act" (Ley Paccionada) that turned officially the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Navarre into another province of Spain. The Basques were forced to enrol in the Spanish military on an individual basis, and not in separate groups or corps, despite the fact that many Basques could hardly articulate a pair of phrases in Spanish, exposing them at best to stressful experiences. These changes allowed Spain to turn in a modern unified country, shaking off the last bits of the Ancien Régime, the first step to end the regionalism driving the forces behind the Carlists and Christinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Alexander hoped that agricultural production could be modernized and made more efficient by eliminating the last remnants of serfdom. This would assist the transformation of Russia from a backward agricultural economy into a modern industrial and capitalist economy. More urgently, Alexander agreed to other liberalizations of Russian society. Among these were the creation of representative bodies called zemstva, in effect a form of local government in villages and provinces, given authority to dispense education, charitable relief and other services.

Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. A lord of the manor could not sell his serfs. On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord, benefiting him with their long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them. But through their condition of near slavery, we can revoke more rights of the serfs and force them in total slavery, untying them from the land and tying them to the lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered  the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was "a complete social order which affects all the activities in life" and "where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded". To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

integrate_uriankhai_title;The Annexation of Tannu Tuva;;;;;;;;;;;;;
integrate_uriankhai_desc;Lately, the Tannu Tuva economy has seriously deteriorated, resulting in the increasing poverty of its people. The causes were varied: declining number of fur-bearing animals probably due to over-hunting by both Uriankhais and Russians, declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia, and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which took a fearful toll on livestock herds. The end of Qing rule in Tannu Tuva brought chaos, bands of Uriankhai began plundering and burning Chinese shops. Uriankhai nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Uriankhai governor (amban-noyon), Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Uriankhai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colonize_uriankhai_title;Claim Uriankhai;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colonize_uriankhai_desc;After the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border by the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), the Qing inexplicably placed border guards south of the Tannu-ola Mountains separating Tannu Uriankhai from Outer Mongolia, not along the Sayan Mountains separating the region from Russia. During the 19th century, Russians began to settle in Tuva. The Qing Dynasty allowed Russians to settle providing that they lived in boats or tents. This historical basis and the Russian population living there provides us with an excuse to add the territory of Tannu Tuva to the Russian borders, and the founding of a new Russian city will only strengthen our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are calls for jihad by Muslim leaders like Maulana Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi and the millenarian Ahmedullah Shah, which were taken up by Muslims, particularly artisans, which caused the British to think that the Muslims were the main force behind this unrest. The Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, resisted these calls for jihad because, it has been suggested, he feared outbreaks of communal violence. By abiding to these calls, expelling the British from Delhi and declaring a Jihad, by shaking off the British influence and dominance, the Shah can be acclaimed Emperor of India, his rightful title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By establishing our dominance over these provinces, we can expel the Russian rulers and annex them back to the Ottoman Empire, centralizing rule and restoring order to these territories that belong in our empire.

establish_caucasus_viceroyalty_desc;The office of the Caucasus Namestnik was established after the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, though the scope of its jurisdiction eventually came to include Eastern Armenia and the lands abutting the western shores of the Caspian Sea. General Karl von Knorring was first to assume this position, being officially titled as the Commander-in-Chief in Georgia and Governor General of Tiflis. The Viceroyalty later expanded to encompass the territories acquired by Russia in a series of wars with the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and the local Caucasian peoples. Headquartered at Tiflis (Tbilisi, Georgia), the viceroys acted as de facto ambassadors to neighboring countries, commanders in chief of the armed forces, and the supreme civil authority, mostly responsible only to the tsar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russify_baltic_states_title;Russify the Baltic States;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russify_baltic_states_desc;The Russian press took up the topic of German influence in the Baltic provinces. As early as the 1860s, the Slavophiles demanded the end of the autonomy in the Baltic provinces and a standardized administration. The unification of Germany and its subsequent development into a Great Power considerably increased the military-strategic importance of the Estonian and Latvian territories which bordered the Baltic Sea, between the extensively autonomous Finland and the rebellious Poland-Lithuania. The security of the capital, Saint Petersburg, became a serious issue for the Russian Empire. Tsarist Russia’s government circles were afraid of the Baltic German's possible orientation towards Germany, especially worrying was the thought that by Germanizing the Estonians and Latvians, the Germans could become the majority nation in the Baltics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Aarão Reis, an urbanist from the State of Pará, was then set to design the second planned city of Brazil, and then Bello Horisonte was finally inaugurated, with many unfinished constructions as the Brazilian Government set a deadline for its completion.

The current governor of Piauhy, José Antônio Saraiva, has put forward plans to build a new city at the shores of the Paranahyba river facilitating communication and commerce.

In the nationalist ideology developed by the founder of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, Antun Saadeh, Syria is seen as the geocultural environment in which the Syrian nation state evolved, an area Sa'adeh called the Syrian Fertile Crescent. Sa'adah rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation, and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He pointed to what he considered to be the region's distinct natural boundaries, and described it as extending from the Taurus range in the northwest and the Zagros Mountains in the northeast, to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea -including the Sinai Peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, and from the eastern Mediterranean Sea including the island of Cyprus in the west, to the arch of the Arabian Desert and the Persian Gulf in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

embrace_the_boer_title;Make Amends with the Boer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Boer farmers, paying compensation, abolishing Company rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Boers accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the 'Fatherland to remain calm', for, as the poem says, 'fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine', implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all aggression.

peking_convention_TPG_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China. In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Aigun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China. There are many within the government, however, who believe it would be in our best interest to access a southern port upon the Sea of Japan -- namely the Chinese city of Haishenwai. Considering the Chinese only barely control their north-eastern provinces, it seems within our right to negotiate for their control... and with their state of turmoil now is the best time to approach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In exchange for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection, the rulers of the constituent territories of the Protectorate agreed not to enter into treaties with or cede territory to any other foreign power. For administrative purposes, the protectorate was informally divided into the Eastern Protectorate (with its own Political Officer, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ advisor, stationed at Mukalla in Qu'aiti) and the Western Protectorate (with its own Political Officer, stationed at Lahej), for some separation of administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

portuguese_civil_code_title;Portuguese Civil Code;;;;;;;;;;;;;
portuguese_civil_code_desc;In 1867, the first Portuguese Civil Code was enacted. Professor Seabra, influenced by the Code Napoleon, wrote the whole Code alone. Other Codifications were also studied and taken into consideration, especially the Allgemeines Landrecht (Prussia), the ABGB (Austria) and the Sardinian Civil Code. But he was able to create a very peculiar style: the systematization is different from the French Code. The Portuguese Civil Code was unique for European civil codes, in its characterization of laws in terms of the person and property. It was divided into four sections: the person, the acquisition of goods, goods, and the defense of those goods or rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into Denmark proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Following the withdrawal of Napoleon's armies from Egypt Muhammad, through a long series of political maneuvering, came to be elected Wali (governor) of Ottoman Egypt, a position he would eventually use to secure Egypt as his own personal domain as Mamluk power waned. During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, European-style, state. Resistance to these reforms will slow down technological progress for a time, but the benefit to Egypt itself will be immeasurable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Currently the floods and famines that have taken its toll on the lands has hit them quite hard, with increased taxes current aristocrats and officials have put in place has brought the peasant classes to the point of revolution. In response to this, the government has instituted a number of social, economic and military reforms in order to placate the peasantry. The gwageo system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan's. Other social reforms were addressed as well: discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry. These reforms would legally change the traditional feudal system that had been followed for hundreds of years..;;;;;;;;;;;;;

create_rhodesia_desc;The British South Africa Company's administration of what became Rhodesia was chartered in 1889 by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, and began with the Pioneer Column's march north-east to Mashonaland. Empowered by its charter to acquire, govern and develop the area north of the Transvaal in southern Africa, the Company, headed by Cecil Rhodes, raised its own armed forces and carved out a huge bloc of territory through treaties, concessions and occasional military action, most prominently overcoming the Matabele army in the Matabele Wars. \n\n By the turn of the century, Rhodes's Company held a vast, land-locked country, bisected by the Zambezi river. It officially named this land Rhodesia in honor of Cecil Rhodes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

iwakura_mission_title;The Iwakura Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iwakura_mission_desc;The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy was a Japanese diplomatic journey around the world, initiated in $YEAR$ by the oligarchs of the Meiji period. Although it was not the only such "mission", it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck and was probably based on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To renegotiate the unequal treaties with the Great Powers that Japan had been forced into during the previous decades and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to effect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

shogunate_constitution_desc;In order for the Tokugawa's rule to survive past this civil unrest, it is necessary to overhaul the Japanese government. Per the Tokugawa Constitution, the Shogun will preside over the Japanese people and dictate large-scale domestic, military and foreign policy. Meanwhile, as a concession to Imperial sympathizers, the Emperor will gain an official leadership role as the speaker of the new Japanese parliament, the Council of Elders, elected by the people's vote. Former daimyos and Imperial court administrators will retain their status by becoming members of the new nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

begin_line_of_advantage_desc;§RThis is mutually exclusive with the path of progress.§! The concept of riekisen, or the 'line of advantage', means that we must extend Japanese influence beyond our national borders in order to ensure our security.

claim_korea_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! With Korea under foreign rule, our nation feels threatened. The 'line of advantage' means that protecting our borders means extending our influence beyond them, and thus we must move to claim the Korean peninsula and wrest it from those who hold it in their grasp -- in the name of Korean freedom, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

order_to_expel_barbarians_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the role of the Emperor has been confined to that of figurehead. We lead Japan, yet we do not. Recently, the leadership of the Shogun has come into question.

peace_with_the_emperor_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the Emperor has remained a figurehead. Even so, he is a leader of the Japanese people and, at times, has expressed dissatisfaction with our own position as ruler of Japan.

commodore_perry_expedition_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§! The Far East remains an enigma, and one which is beyond the reach of most western powers due to the enforced seclusion of China and Japan. While China is largely spoken for, Japan remains a potential target for American influence to expand. If we are to be taken seriously as a world power, we must consider sending a force to negotiate for trade rights with the Japanese-- under the threat of military force, if necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kanagawa_treaty_title;The Treaty of Kanagawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kanagawa_treaty_desc;With enough pressure placed on the Japanese, they will be forced to the negotiating table. A treaty can be hammered out at Kanagawa which will see Japan opened to outside trade and influence, and our superiority proven beyond the shadow of a doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ansei_harris_treaty_desc;After Commodore Perry's voyage to Japan, trade relations between Japan and the United States were established at gunpoint. However, the exact terms of those trade relations were not firmly dictated. Perry himself has delegated that task to diplomat and merchant Townsend Harris. He is ready to be dispatched to Japan upon our command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The time has come to restore Emperor Mutsuhito to power. For too long has the imperial court been forced to remain but a figurehead, with central authority remaining with the tyrannical Tokugawa clan. Japan must have one ruler, an Emperor that can lead the nation into the future. Let us send our forces to Kyoto, to seize the imperial palace and set the coup in motion.\n\n§RNOTE: To win this war, you must occupy Edo or White Peace with the Shogun. You must not allow Kyoto and your capital to become occupied.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

abolish_the_han_system_desc;The han system, under which the daimyo rule as feudal lords with very little central authority remaining to the government, is an antiquated relic that must be eliminated. The domains shall be replaced with prefectures, and the daimyos given roles as governors and bureaucrats. There will be resistance, but all will come to understand that this is for the greater good of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the embracing of Western ideas and authority slowly falling away from the Shogunate, the government will naturally pass first to the imperial court-- and eventually, with the extension of voting privileges to the landowners, to the Japanese people themselves.

fsa_shermans_march_to_the_sea_desc;During the campaign he conducted in November and December of 1864, Major General William Tecumseh Sherman applied the doctrines of Total War in what can best be described as a campaign of terror directed at the civilian population of the North. By operating deep inside Free American territory, and by destroying much of the north's civilian infrastructure, Sherman is often said to have broken the North's will to fight.

france_protector_of_eastern_christians_desc;Up until now, the Russians have maintained sovereign authority over Christians in the Holy Land -- authority that rightfully belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. It is time for that to change. Furthermore, the Holy Lands can be a way of reuniting France after the political divisions of 1848-49. The revolutionary left can be reconciled if it was engaged in a patriotic fight for liberty against the 'gendarme of Europe,' and the Catholic right had long been pressing for a crusade against Orthodoxy that to them threatened Christendom and French westernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

self_strengthening_movement_desc;The Self-Strengthening Movement was a period of institutional reforms initiated in China during the late Qing dynasty following a series of military defeats and concessions to foreign powers. \n\n The majority of the ruling elite still subscribed to a conservative Confucian worldview, but following China's serious defeats in the First and Second Opium Wars, several officials now argued that in order to strengthen itself against the West, it was necessary to adopt Western military technology and armaments. This could be achieved by establishing shipyards and arsenals, and by hiring foreign advisers to train Chinese artisans to manufacture such wares in China. As such, the "self-strengtheners" were by and large uninterested in any social reform beyond the scope of economic and military modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

option_disable_mobilization_bug_title;Disable Mobilization Bug Fix;;;;;;;;;;;;;
option_disable_mobilization_bug_desc;There's a vanilla bug that happens when a country that is mobilizing is annexed, which results in the country having "ghost units" - units in exile that belong to a country that doesn't exist. This creates problems with pops and screws with unit visibility, so HPM has a fix: when the AI detects the problem, they will give a random province to the country that has the ghost units until it de-mobilize. This happens around 10 times during a game and the country that demobilizes exists for around 10 days, then it's reabsorbed like nothing happened. This shouldn't cause any problems during a normal game, but if for some reason you'd rather not have the bugfix, this option will disable it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

enact_dual_monarchy_BOH_desc;With the loss of not only Hungary but also our place on the world stage, we must seek a radical solution to stabilize the Habsburg realm in order to avoid being absorbed by the ever-growing Germany. Some of the prominent Czech intellectuals have started to promote the idea of Austro-Slavism in opposition to Russian Pan-Slavism. Considering our current population maps and dwindling empire, it is clear what we should do: embrace the Slavic character of our Empire, emphasize our Catholic tradition and prevent interslavic squabbles through neutral Habsburg German rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
five_year_plan_desc;The Five-year plan was a list of economic goals, created by Communist Party General Secretary Joseph Stalin, based on his policy of Socialism in One Country. The plan was implemented in 1928 and took effect until 1932. The Soviet Union entered a series of five-year plans which began in 1928 under the rule of Joseph Stalin. Stalin launched what would later be referred to as a "revolution from above" to improve the Soviet Union's domestic policy. The policies were centered around rapid industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. Stalin desired to remove and replace any policies created under the New Economic Policy. The plan, overall, was to transition the Soviet Union from a weak, poorly controlled, agriculture state, into an industrial powerhouse. While the vision was grand, its planning was ineffective and unrealistic given the short amount of time given to meet the desired goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1512058;The question of internal organization was important in the new kolkhozes. The most basic measure was to divide the workforce into a number of groups, generally known as brigades, for working purposes. It was already normal practice for the large kolkhoz of 200-400 households to be divided into temporary or permanent work units of 15-30 households.' The authorities gradually came down in favor of the fixed, combined brigade, that is the brigade with its personnel, land, equipment and draught horses fixed to it for the whole period of agricultural operations, and taking responsibility for all relevant tasks during that period. The brigade was headed by a brigade leader. This was usually a local man (a few were women).;;;;;;;;;;;;;

collectivise_farms_desc;State farms, began to be created in the early 1920s as an ideological example of "socialist agriculture of the highest order". Kolkhozes, or collective farms, were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organized by the state on land confiscated from former large estates (so-called "state reserve land" that was left over after distribution of land to individuals) and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. In farms of both types, however, a system of internal passports prevented movement of employees and members from rural areas to urban areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

dai_nam_desc;Our kingdom unofficially goes by many names due to the need for us reconcile our nationalism with our duty to show humility toward our suzerain masters, the Chinese. The name "Viet Nam" was a compromise agreed upon by King Nguyen Phuc An and the Jiaqing Emperor in 1802, since the name we truly desired to take on, Nam Viet, was seen as defiant toward China. This is because Nam Viet is also the Vietnamese translation of Nanyue, an ancient Chinese vassal state comprising most of Vietnam as well as Canton, Kwangsi, and Hainan. But times have changed. It is better for us to show that we can stand on our own two feet and proclaim an even nobler name for our kingdom: Dai Nam, or "Great South.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

establish_ypf_oil_desc;Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, or YPF for short, was the company created by Argentine president Hipólito Yrigoyen after the discovery of the first oil deposits in Comodoro Rivadavia, and was the first entirely state-run oil company in the world. The region's settlements grew rapidly, and the company at one point had fifty thousand workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaco_cotton_title;Plant Cotton in the Gran Chaco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaco_cotton_desc;Ever since we took control of the Gran Chaco, the region's economy has been nearly entirely dependent on exploitation of its vast woodland, be it for lumber or for the production of tannin. However, prospectors have recently identified that the region around the Paraná river holds great potential for cotton plantations. If we were to follow these suggestions, we could greatly benefit the region's economy, as this would invite more immigrant farmers and help diversify the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
law_8871_title;The Sáenz Peña Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;
law_8871_desc;The Sáenz Peña Law would be Law 8871 of $COUNTRY$, sanctioned by the National Congress in $YEAR$, which would establish the universal, secret and compulsory male suffrage though the creation of an electoral list. The law, however, would not account for non-naturalized immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

build_san_roque_dam_desc;Several proposals have been brought up to construct a dam in the fertile Quisquisacate Valley using the Cosquín and San Antonio rivers.

choose_capital_lpl_desc;With the creation of $COUNTRY$, a question of utmost importance has come up: the location of the capital city. Many important national figures have proposed their city as the center of administration, and it is now time that we choose the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ seat of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;
colon_theatre_title;Build the Colón Theater;;;;;;;;;;;;;
colon_theatre_desc;The original Teatro Colón, built in 1857, has been in decline for quite a few decades now. If we were to rebuild the building, it could become the best of Latin America, and perhaps one of the best in the world, bringing great prestige to our nation. However such an operation would be expensive too, and it might cause unrest among Buenos Aires' middle and lower classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
la_mazorca_title;La Mazorca;;;;;;;;;;;;;

buenos_aires_conquest_desc;The southern coast of Buenos Aires has been a mostly uncolonized territory, except from a few outposts and forts like Fortaleza Protectora Argentina, founded in 1828 as a military fort. The outpost's strategic location is needed to secure more territories in the Pampas, and it's seeing a large immigration.

claim_historic_occitania_desc;Since the Reaper's War and the French conquests of our cousins, the Occitans, our people in Occitania have been separated and almost completely assimilated to the French culture.

move_capital_to_valencia_desc;Valencia is the richest city in Aragon in terms of culture, and has already been our capital before. With Valencia under our firm control, and their people feeling good in our federation, we could perhaps move our capital to Valencia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_west_mediterranean_desc;Our ancestors claimed this islands to control the Mediterranean trade, and gived long lasting heritage to its population, one of them the city of L'Alguer, a city populated by and for Catalans, tried to be assimilated for years.

war_for_catalonia_desc;Since 1715, our brothers have been oppressed for our neighbors. We are in the sphere of influence of France, so we might could start a war over the Catalonian States, giving the French influence over the north of Spain, in exchange for us having the Catalan territories.

claim_historic_lanfang_title;Claim our lost lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_historic_lanfang_desc;We've been limited to San Khew Jong since the Dutch influenced the Bornean peoples and funded rebellions in our territory.

argie_university_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ university reform was a general modernization of the universities, especially tending towards democratization, brought about by student activism during the presidency of Hipolito Yrigoyen.

parana_development_title;Focus $COUNTRY$'s development along the Parana river;;;;;;;;;;;;;
parana_development_desc;Now that we have overrun the federalists from the government and established a rightfully unitarian Argentina, a proposal has come forth: the idea that we should concentrate our funds to properly develop the Mesopotamia region, as a gift for Corrientes' constant unitary rebellions against Rosas, by improving local quality of life, bettering the farming practices and building waterways along the many rivers, alongside constructing new infrastructure and a better port in Paraná, we could make the Mesopotamia $COUNTRY$'s heartland. However, this would be rather expensive and might cause unrest among the people of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alliance_with_rgs_title;Propose an alliance with Rio Grande do Sul;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alliance_with_rgs_desc;We are in similar circumstances to the farrapos in southern Brazil, who are fighting their war for independence. Allying them in secret would greatly benefit our chances of successfully rebelling against the regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

derqui_varela_treaty_desc;The area of Misiones has been disputed between $COUNTRY$ and Paraguay for several years now, creating problems with commerce, international relations between us and Paraguay, and more.

dispute_palmas_title;The Palmas Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dispute_palmas_desc;The region of Palmas, also known as the Misiones Orientales Mesopotámicas, is one of the last disputed territories regarding the Eastern Misiones. We lack a treaty delineating the region's borders. By delegating the current president of the United States to arbitrate where the border stands, we can fix this dispute permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

invade_manchuria_desc;§RGain 10 infamy§! China is a long-coveted prize for any colonial power with the military needed to seize its territory. Manchuria, located in China's northeast, is a large and resource-bountiful region, and our recent acquisitions in the Far East make invading it much easier.

found_the_shinpo_gakkai_desc;During our sudden wave of modernization, groups of Japanese scholars have traveled abroad to gain knowledge about Western society and technology. These men, most notably the Choshu Five, would make excellent founding members of a scholarly society dedicated to advancing our country's development. The Shinpo Gakkai, or "scholarly society of progress," will directly serve the Shogun's vision for Japan's future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bushiguntai_title;Integrate the Samurai into the Military;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bushiguntai_desc;With our national army being heavily composed of former samurai, we have decided that the training standards samurai historically held themselves to should be co-opted by our armed forces. This means that our soldiers will be trained with the rigor of lifetime warriors, and they will cultivate an appreciation for our nation's traditional culture by studying classical literature. The military will be the new home of the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
abandon_dentoudou_title;Abandon the Dentoudou;;;;;;;;;;;;;
abandon_dentoudou_desc;The Japanese Shogunate has resolved to preserve the traditional Japanese way of life and partially sacrifice its ability to expand its military influence, in favor of putting domestic affairs above all else. Additionally, Japan continues to appear alien to Westerners, continuing to reject the virtues of their society and the advantages they have over some of the less desirable elements of our traditional culture. It is time for this to change. Japan will commit fully to continuous revolutionization of its society in the name of cementing the Japanese people's place in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_puna_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! Ever since the integration of Antofagasta into $COUNTRY$ and our occupation of San Pedro de Atacama, the Puna de Atacama, an arid plateau, has not had any clear border demarcation. The region contains settlers from both $COUNTRY$ and Argentina, and it contains large deposits of iron, copper, saltpeter and more. It is time that we lay claim to this rightful extension of our territory so none can deny us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
propose_buchanan_title;The Puna de Atacama dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;
propose_buchanan_desc;Ever since the Chilean occupation of San Pedro de Atacama, they have laid claim over all of the Puna de Atacama, a large, arid plateau. This claim overlaps with ours on the region, and this could potentially end in war. If we want to prevent a conflict and establish definitive borders, we must subject the dispute to international mediation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

national_territories_chaco_desc;Law No. 1532 of National Territories enacted on October 16, 1884, which created the jurisdictions of all the national territories of the country, established the division of the national territory of the Gran Chaco, into two national territories or governorates: National Territory of Formosa and National Territory of the Chaco.\n§YNOTE: This will turn all your holdings in the Chaco into colonies, and will therefore erase any effects.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

may_pacts_title;Pactos de Mayo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
may_pacts_desc;The Pacts of May (Pactos de Mayo in Spanish) are a series of proposed protocols to sign between $COUNTRY$ and Argentina. The protocols state that Argentina must renounce the ability to intervene in the Chilean affairs in the Pacific Ocean, that both countries will sell off any warship being constructed in Europe and that both governments will work together to peacefully fix their border disputes in the southern Andes. By proposing this pact to the Argentinians, we will finally be able to solve our territorial disputes, even if it might mean renouncing some territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modernize_navy_title;Modernization of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Navy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modernize_navy_desc;Following recent wars involving our naval forces, it has been proving that our ships are falling behind as steamers, ironclads, monitors and torpedo boats become all the more prominent. To keep up with current naval technology, it has been proposed we purchase several modern vessels from the United Kingdom, and that we establish a proper naval school in our nation to properly train navy officers. However, this all might prove rather costly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sarmiento_school_reforms_title;Domingo Sarmiento's School Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sarmiento_school_reforms_desc;Following the first ever census in $COUNTRY$, it has come to our attention that an incredibly small amount of our population can properly read, with the majority being illiterate. President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento has proposed we begin constructing schools and overall increasing government subsidies to education, in an attempt to better educate the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaco_boreal_conquest_title;Conquest of the Chaco Boreal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaco_boreal_conquest_desc;The Chaco Boreal region has largely remained in native hands until now. It's time to pacify this region and expand our borders, we need to claim this land so no one can deny it from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
puerto_suarez_title;The Foundation of Puerto Suárez;;;;;;;;;;;;;
puerto_suarez_desc;Our frontier with the Gran Chaco and its fierce native population has never truly been pacified, and the Guarani tribes inhabiting our claims have managed to resist our advances. However, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ explorer Miguel Suárez Arana has gone on an expedition to the region with the objective to establish a settlement on the right bank of the Paraguay river. With these advances, the frontier of the Chaco will finally be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

decoud_quijarro_treaty_desc;Our border dispute with Paraguay in the chaco has gone on for too long.

mines_lategame_per_title;Mines in Eastern Persia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mines_lategame_per_desc;It has been known for now years that deposits of iron and coal exist on the east of our country, but they are difficult to access. Years ago, we didn't have the technology nor money to invert on the deposits, but with our recent westernization and our industrial status, the deposits are now both economically and industrially positive, as our industry craves for raw materials and the present technology makes it cheaper for us to exploit them. It would give huge wealth to our country, and a good international and trade position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
neues_museum_berlin_title;Das Neue Museum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
neues_museum_berlin_desc;Today Friedrich August Stüler, a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, a famous city planner, proposed to build a new museum in the center of Berlin. The Neues Museum would be the second museum to be built on the Museum Island and is intended as an extension to house collections which can't be accommodated in the Altes Museum.

The Romanovs have brought pain to our population and glorious proletariat for centuries--but now, they have been overthrown by our revolution to bring our communist utopia into existence. The family has been exiled to Yekaterinburg, near the Ural Mountains, and a batallion of our great Red Army occupies the royal palace. In the commandant's office, they are already assigning victims to each killer before distributing the handguns. The execution is planned this night, while the Romanovs will be having dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEADROMANOV;"The prisoners were told to wait in the cellar room while the truck that would transport them was being brought to the House.

This night have been also murdered members of the imperial entourage who had accompanied them: court physician Eugene Botkin, lady-in-waiting Anna Demidova, footman Alexei Trupp, and head cook Ivan Kharitonov. The bodies have been taken then to the Koptyaki forest, where they have been stripped, buried, and mutilated with grenades to prevent identification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
demand_israeli_independence_title;Demand Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
demand_israeli_independence_desc;The tensions between Jews and Arabs in the Land of Israel have festered for too long, and our colonial overlords have failed again and again to stop the violence from claiming lives in the Jewish community. This cannot continue. We will never achieve our dream of establishing the Jewish state with the Land of Israel being ruled as a colonial mandate. We are fully capable of ruling ourselves. If the Mandatory government will not protect us, we will demand our independence. If they refuse, we will take up arms against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_arabs_title;Accept the Arabs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_arabs_desc;Never have Zionists asserted that non-Jews cannot be allowed to live equally in the Jewish state. For us to continue living in the land of Israel peacefully means coming to terms with a clear truth: that the Arabs who live here today cannot all be faulted for our mistreatment and expulsion in the past. It's time to be bold and reimagine our country not just as the Nation of the Jews, but a multiethnic confederation for whom the land each has value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
taiwan_sugar_plantations_title;Sugar Industry in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
taiwan_sugar_plantations_desc;Sugarcane is a foreign crop to Taiwan, previously used as an important export during Dutch colonial rule. With domestic and international demand for sugar being always high, however, it is tempting to reintroduce sugar to the island and reap its profits. We will need to also set up a rail system able to transport harvested sugarcane to the island's ports.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
saipan_sugar_plantations_title;Sugar Industry in Saipan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
saipan_sugar_plantations_desc;Saipan is far from a profitable territory, despite its strategic importance in the Pacific. Nevertheless, its lush grasslands' agricultural potential cannot be understated. And what better cash crop to introduce to this impoverished island than sugar?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
declare_hebrew_national_language_title;Declare Hebrew the National Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;
declare_hebrew_national_language_desc;Hebrew has survived past its death as a spoken language by being the main language of Jewish prayer and the language of a large body of Jewish scholarship. However, Hebrew has been rapidly re-emerging from the ashes as a language spoken day-to-day by the citizens of the fledgling Jewish state. This miracle is courtesy of intellectuals continuing the Hebrew literary tradition, most notably linguist Eliezer Ben Yehuda, who compiled a modern Hebrew dictionary replete with his own coined words. How could we not declare our ancestral tongue as the revived Jewish nation's official language?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_audiencia_of_charcas_title;Reclaim the Audiencia of Charcas;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Real Audiencia of Charcas (now known as Bolivia) was a region that was ruled under the Viceroyalty of Peru for most of the imperal era until 1776, after which it was transferred to Buenos Aires which administered it up to independence. Even though Bolivia is closer to Peru than it is to us, we can now take the opportunity to secure our position as the successor of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata and reclaim the Charcas as ours by any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
occupation_of_the_magellan_strait_title;Claim the Strait of Magellan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
occupation_of_the_magellan_strait_desc;Thanks to our strategic advances in Patagonia, we are now in the position to stake a claim to the Strait of Magellan. This area, while remote, would without a doubt give us more leeway in the affairs of South America. Even with the possibility of crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific via Central America, it is faster to go via the Strait of Magellan for ships traveling from or to countries in area of the Southern Cone. Thus, the strait plays a significant role in worldwide trade and would be an economic and strategic boon. It is therefore vital that we claim it as our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_turkic_union_title;Proclaim the Turkic Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_turkic_union_desc;The battle against the enemies of the Turkic peoples has been long and bloody. For centuries, our brothers have been subjugated and oppressed.

proclaim_akhand_bharat_desc;§RGain 25 infamy§! The lands to the immediate south, east, and west--ruled either under the British Raj or by entities under Indian influence since antiquity--are an inseparable part of Indian westernization. We must claim all of it--from the eastern frontier of the legendary Maurya Empire to the easternmost centers of influence under the Chola dynasty. For us to unite these lands under our rule would be to fully redeem ourselves from the humiliation of foreign rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_afro_americans_title;Integrate African Americans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accept_afro_americans_desc;We were wrong not to immediately seek integration of our Black population after the Civil War. From now on, it will be a state mission to bring Afro-Americans to the same socioeconomic standing as Whites, and we will pursue a zero-tolerance policy toward discrimination. We hold the truth to be self-evident that all men are created equal, no matter their race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_jewish_autonomy_title;Restore Jewish Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_jewish_autonomy_desc;In the days before our empire fell, the Jews within our borders governed themselves as their own estate, with a national body known as the Council of Four Lands and an autonomous regional governing structure known as the Kahal system. Under this arrangement, Jews could exert full authority over their religious and secular lives, with rabbinical courts serving as the supreme judicial body. We respect the Jews' right to maintain their religious and national identity. Thus we should restore the Council of Four Lands and the Kehalim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
papal_decree_title;Call an Ecumenical Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
papal_decree_desc;With the Papal throne once again sitting amongst the greatest powers of the world, the importance and prestige of the Papal court has once again expanded substantially, and the decisions made there once again carry global weight. As such, the power of the Papacy can, at this time, potentially be abused in the name of secular gain. However, this will be very costly and controversial, severely damaging the prestige of the Vatican, which necessarily relies on a perception of neutrality and ecclesiastical goodwill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
papal_claim_naples_title;The Neapolitan Vespers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
papal_claim_naples_desc;In ages past, in the days of old Papal supremacy, the region of Sicily was considered by the Papacy to be rightfully a domain of the Church. Due to Byzantine meddling and military weakness in the War of the Sicilian Vespers, however, the Catholic Church was unable to enforce its ecclesiastical domain over the kingdom of Sicily. Now that Papal power is rising once again, the Papacy can renew these old claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
papal_claim_tuscany_title;The Papal Claim to Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
papal_claim_tuscany_desc;During the Middle Ages, the republic of Florence proved a continual adversary to the Papal state, opposing attempts by the Pope to cement control over the center and north of Italy. Now that the Papacy is reclaiming a locally dominant position in the Italian peninsula, it can lay claim to these lands once more, and place the whole of central Italy into its domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
assert_power_greece_title;Assert power over the Bavarian King;;;;;;;;;;;;;
assert_power_greece_desc;The Greek crown currently sits unsteady on the head of the bavarian king, imposed upon them by the Great Powers of Europe. He attempts to rule as an absolute monarch, and the Hellenes beneath him strife under his reign. With the power vested in the Vicar of Christ, there is a unique opportunity to exploit here. By isolating, dominating, and finally excommunicating and deposing the Bavarian king, the Vatican can emplace itself and its clerical authority as the predominant force in this rump state, turning Greece into a de facto protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_outremer_title;Reclaim Outremer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_outremer_desc;The Crusades have long since ended, and in abysmal failure no less, but the Catholic world has never truly forgotten them. Many monarchs even now proclaim themselves the rightful kings of Jerusalem, yet was not the first ruler of Jerusalem merely the Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre, and therefore a servant of the Church? Placing Jerusalem in the direct hands of the Church will finally vindicate this ancient stain on the legacy of Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
imperio_latino_title;Imperii Latini Constantinopolitani;;;;;;;;;;;;;
imperio_latino_desc;The abominable Latin Empire, a Venetian puppet and construct of the 4th Crusade, was condemned by the Papacy from its onset. However, times have changed in these many past centuries. The lands of Greece and Anatolia languish under the yoke of the crescent moon, and none are left who will uphold the honor of the church. The Latin Empire existed once, and the Hagia Sophia was in the hands of the Catholic Church, and so should the Papacy take the holy city for itself, it only stands to reason it may claim the rest of this rump state's forgotten legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_distributism_title;End the Policy of Distributism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_distributism_desc;The policy of Distributism, imposed top-down by the Catholic church, no longer represents the economic course the nation should be going down, and represents an undue influence of the church in everyday life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

greater_philippines_desc;According to the principle of "Uti possidetis juris", there are neighboring lands that should be ours, and rightfully so. Ever since the independence of our nation, we have seen ourselves incomplete as a nation as the regions of Sabah and Micronesia, that were both once ruled from Manila, fell to the hands of external powers.

PHL_inherit_sulu_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! We now find ourselves in a rather unique position, in which our deep historical ties with the Sultanate of Sulu have entrenched their dependency on our nation. Therefore, the possibility of inheriting their claims over Northeast Borneo is now available for us. Doing so would undoubtedly secure our position as a maritime power in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

philippine_micronesia_desc;If our nation is to become a notable maritime power, we must expand our influence across our neighboring waters and into Micronesia. We hold titles to the Marshall and Gilbert Islands to the east, in addition to the Wake and Bonin Islands to the north. We must seize them before other foreign powers set their designs on these territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
philippine_formosa_title;Claim Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
philippine_formosa_desc;§RGain 8 infamy§! Briefly, during the 17th century, the island of Formosa was claimed by our former overlords, the Spaniards. After being conquered, it was placed under the control of Manila to be governed from. However, our rule proved to be short-lived. The Dutch ousted the Spanish colonial government from its shores, allowing for the loss of their influence over the island. Almost 200 years later, we find ourselves in the privileged position to exercise our former claim over Formosa and terminate foreign rule over the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
