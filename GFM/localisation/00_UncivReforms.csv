accelerated_vulcanization;Accelerated Vulcanization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
accelerated_vulcanization_desc;It was discovered in the early Twentieth Century that the addition of the organic compound aniline produced an accelerating effect. The active zinc salts in the aniline react strongly with the zinc oxide present in sulfur-vulcanized rubber to decrease the cure time necessary. Other compounds were later used that provided even faster cure times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
silk_waste_spinning;Silk Waste Spinning;;;;;;;;;;;;;
silk_waste_spinning_desc;This was a cumulative set of processes developed throughout the 19th century to process previously unusable silk. Sources of waste silk included the gummy silk fibres left over the predominant Silk Throwing Process and from the cocoons of the mulberry worms themselves. Previously this 'waste silk' had accounted for nearly 50% of raw silk production, and now it could be utilized too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
inclosure;Inclosure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
inclosure_desc;Inclosure is the process which was used in order to end some traditional rights, such as mowing meadows for hay, or grazing livestock on land which is owned by another person. Under inclosure, such land is fenced and deeded or entitled to one or more owners. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and in relatively small parts of the lowlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

traction_engines;Traction Engines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
traction_engines_desc;The traction engine is a self-propelled steam engine. Developed in the mid-nineteenth century, they were slow, heavy, and not very manouverable. However, they provided a clear revolution in road haulage of agricultural and forest products, replacing draught animals as the primary movers. Traction engines also could be used to provide a localized power source, and smaller versions were later produced that could plough fields without sinking into the soil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_farming;Industrial Farming;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_farming_desc;The notion of a farm being the province of a single family or landowner is slowly becoming a thing of the past. The production of food is an industry, and the cost of farm machinery simply beyond the means of many. Large businesses are stepping in, creating industrial farms that are more akin to factories than anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

alite;Alite;;;;;;;;;;;;;
alite_desc;Alite is a name for tricalcium silicate. It is the major, and characteristic, mineral phases in Portland cement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mechanized_sawmills;Mechanized Sawmills;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mechanized_sawmills_desc;The introduction of steam power to the operations of sawmills allowed for a greater level of mechanization. Mills could be located far from water with the addition of rail connections. Mechanized Sawmills saw greater efficiency as the scrap waste from lumber production could be used to fuel the boilers. Increased factory costs came with the gains in efficiency however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
diode;Diodes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
diode_desc;In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal electronic component with asymmetric transfer characteristic, with low (ideally zero) resistance to current flow in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. Diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
triode_desc;A triode is an electronic amplification device having three active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a vacuum tube (or valve in British English) with three elements: the filament or cathode, the grid, and the plate or anode. The triode vacuum tube was the first electronic amplification device, which propelled the electronics age forward, by enabling amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tetrode_desc;A tetrode is an electronic device having four active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a two-grid vacuum tube. It has the three electrodes of a triode and an additional screen grid which significantly changes its behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
crystal_radio_desc;A crystal radio receiver, also called a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, is a very simple radio receiver, popular in the early days of radio. It needs no battery or power source and runs on the power received from radio waves by a long wire antenna. It gets its name from its most important component, known as a crystal detector, originally made with a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
valve_radio_sets_desc;With the discovery that triode valves could amplify signals it was soon noticed that they would also oscillate, a fact that was exploited in generating signals. Once the triode was established as an amplifier it made a tremendous difference to radio receiver performance as it allowed the incoming signals to be amplified. This gave significant improvements in the levels of gain that could be achieved, greatly increasing selectivity, enabling this type of receiver to outperform all other types of the era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
carbon_transmitter_desc;Before the proliferation of vacuum tube amplifiers in the 1920s, carbon transmitters were the only practical means of obtaining high-level audio signals, and were widely used in telephone systems. Their low cost," inherently high output and ""peaked"" frequency response characteristic were well suited for this application", and their use in new telephone installations continued up to the 1980s, long after they had been replaced by other types of microphones in other applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
candlestick_telephone_desc;The candlestick telephone is a style of telephone that was common from the late 1890s to the 1930s. Also known as a desk stand, upright, or a stick phone, it came with or without a rotary dial, and with a ringer box.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bullough_n_kenworthys_lancashire_loom;Bullough and Kenworthy's Lancashire Loom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bullough_n_kenworthys_lancashire_loom_desc;The Lancashire Loom was invented in 1842 by James Bullough and William Kenworthy. It was a culmination of several advances made to the Roberts Power Loom from 1830, it was a semi-automatic loom with a single-stop action for changing shuttles. It incorporated an improved automatic filling process and better temples to smooth the edges of the fabric. A Lancashire Loom could increased the productivity of a weaver by a factor of twelve times compared to an existing Cartwright Loom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
machine_made_steel_cans;Machine-Made Steel Cans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
machine_made_steel_cans_desc;A cumulative process of inventions and improvements have enabled canning factories to mechanize the production of cans and replace the tinned wrought-iron used with cheap steel. These new cans were smaller and could be produced in greater quantities to meet a growing demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
double_seams;Double Seams;;;;;;;;;;;;;
double_seams_desc;Double Seams were invented in 1888 by Max Ams. A double seam uses advanced metal rolling techniques to create a double-edged seal between the rolled tin plate lids and the body of the can. Double Seaming provided an air-tight lid to keep micro-organisms out. It also removed the need to use solder as a sealant, thus making steel cans cheaper and faster to produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lombard_and_holts_continuous_track;Lombard and Holt's Continuous Track;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lombard_and_holts_continuous_track_desc;Alvin Lombard patented an effective continuous track system in 1901. This method of vehicle propulsion consisted of an interlocking band of hardened metal plates rotating around two or more wheels. Benjamin Holt acquired the patent in 1905 and began mass production. Holt later trademarked his system as "Caterpillar Tracks" after soldiers likened it to the movements of a caterpillar. Holt's track system was one of the key elements in the development of construction equipment and tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mercerization;Mercerization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mercerization_desc;Mercerization is a chemical process developed by Englishman John Mercer in 1844. He developed a chemical treatment for cotton using sodium hydroxide. Mercerization strengthened the fibres and made them easier to dye. H.A. Lowe modernized and popularized Mercer's treatment in the 1890s, producing cotton fabric with a lustrous appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vacuum_distillation;Vacuum Distillation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vacuum_distillation_desc;Vacuum distillation is a process for separating hydrocarbons using pressure. The liquid hydrocarbons are channeled into the lower portion of the distillation column at a temperature no greater than 370 degrees Celsius at an absolute pressure. The pressure in the column increases gradually from the top of the column to the bottom. The hydrocarbons evaporate and are piped out at various levels whenever the atmospheric pressure above the hydrocarbon to be distilled is lower than its vapor pressure. Vacuum distillation increases the relative volatility of the components, making the separation process quicker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fractional_distillation;Fractional Distillation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fractional_distillation_desc;Fractional Distillation is a process of separating crude oil into various fractions of hydrocarbons. The Crude Oil is heated to a temperature between 350 and 370 degrees Celsius which causes vaporization. The gas is then fed into a fractional distillation column, which is made up of several trays and outflowing channels. As the vapour rises, it cools according to its boiling point. The fractions with high boiling points condense into the lower trays; those with lower boiling points condense in the upper trays.;;;;;;;;;;;;
fluid_catalytic_cracking;Fluid Catalytic Cracking;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fluid_catalytic_cracking_desc;Fluid Catalytic Cracking is the most significant of the refining processes. It converts the high-boiling components of heavy crude oils into low-boiling, high-octane components such as gasoline and aviation fuels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bergius_process;Bergius Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bergius_process_desc;The Bergius Process is a chemical process developed by German chemist Friedrich Bergius in 1913. The Bergius Process diectly converts coal to useful synthetic fuels. Once finely ground, the coal is dried by the addition of hot gas. Heavy oil is recycled from the process and added to the mixture. A catalyst may also be introduced to trigger or speed up the conversion reaction. Bergius received the Nobel Prize in 1931 for his work in high pressure chemistry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fischer_tropsch_process;Fischer-Tropsch Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fischer_tropsch_process_desc;The Fischer Tropsh Process was developed at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung in 1925 by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. The Fischer-Tropsch Process indirectly produces synthetic oils and fuels via a series of reactions. Coal or Natural Gas is converted to a gaseous state, and then reacts with a mixture of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen to produce various hydrocarbon products. Nazi Germany used this process extensively in the Second World War to convert their abundant coal stocks into replacement fuels after they were cut off from most natural sources of oil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
synthetic_cement;Synthetic Cement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
synthetic_cement_desc;'Natural' cement,namely cement that does not use chemical processes to make the result more durable,began to fall out of use with the production of modern concrete. A variety of synthetic brands has developed and has resulted in a burgeoning construction industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

interruptor_gears;Interrupter Gears;;;;;;;;;;;;;
interruptor_gears_desc;These were inventions which enabled machine guns to be mounted in front of the cockpit of the airplane to give it real combat power for the first time. One type of gear synchronized the firing of the guns with the spinning arc of the propellers to prevent them being shot off. The second or true interrupter gear developed with bombers prevented the guns from firing if any part of the plane would take a hit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
medium_tanks;Medium Tanks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
medium_tanks_desc;The Medium tank was developed in the interwar period to correct the design deficiencies and lack of speed of the early heavy tanks and the mobile yet underarmored and outgunned light tanks. Medium tanks featured a main gun of between 37 and 76 millimeters to give it a more than adequate punch. At the same time, they were built with 360 degree revolving turrets and usually armed with at least one machine gun to provide defense from infantry attacks. They were built to specific designs with thicker armor than light tanks and with a lower profile, increasing their ability to survive on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#POP Growth Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sanitation_desc;It was not until the development of sanitation that the presence of waste and sewage in cities was even considered to be a health issue.

defamation_of_women_desc;A cultural shift has begun which assigns to women a lesser status than that of men, even beyond their traditional inability to partake in politics. Common thought is that women are lesser creatures, best suited as chattel and as producers of children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#Economic Thought Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
adam_smith;Adam Smith;;;;;;;;;;;;;
adam_smith_desc;Adam Smith was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher of political economy. He was author of The Theory of Moral Sentiments and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Smith promoted the central tenement of Capitalism as the individual pursuing his own self-interest, and in so doing, promoting the greater good. He talked about the "invisible hand" that would guide the actions of individuals and argued against government interference in all but a aspects of the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jean_baptiste_say;Jean-Baptiste Say;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jean_baptiste_say_desc;Jean-Baptiste Say was a French scholar active in the field of political economy. A contemporary of Adam Smith, he also advocated economic competition and freedom of trade. He wrote the Traité d'économie politique ou simple exposition de la manière dont se forment, se distribuent et se composent les richesses, originally published in 1803. Say's Law of Markets was derived thus from his treatise, "Inherent in supply is the wherewithal for its own consumption.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

thomas_robert_malthus_desc;Thomas Robert Malthus was a British scholar, influential in political economy and demography. Malthus popularized the economic theory of rent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
floating_international_exchange_rates;Floating International Exchange Rates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
floating_international_exchange_rates_desc;In a Floating Exchange Rate region, the value of the currency is set by supply and demand in the international markets. This is measured freely against the currencies of other countries. The Central Bank may intervene in cases of rapid and extreme movement by the currency price in either direction. It buys or sells from its own currency reserves to stabilize the value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
monetization_of_debt;Monetization of Debt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
monetization_of_debt_desc;By monetizing the debt, the Central Bank could artificially decrease the fiscal deficit and increase the money supply of the country. It would print new money and use it to purchase public debt instruments (bonds and bills) issued by the Treasury. This has the effect of moving the debt off of the public balance sheet, with the Central Bank remitting the balance of the interest earnings back to the Treasury on a regular basis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#Philosophy Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
montesquieu;Montesquieu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
montesquieu_desc;Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu was a French lawyer and political philosopher. He was best known for his support of constitutional government with a clear separation of powers. In his most famous work, 'The Spirit of the Laws (1748),' Montesquieu developed a series of classification sytems to describe governments and societies. He divided French society into three classes: the monarchy, the aristocracy and the commons, and he said that they should be equally dependent on and separate from eachother. Government administration was divided into three branches, the executive, legislative, and the judicial. His separation of powers later became embedded in the U.S. and other modern constitutions. He popularized the term 'Despotism' by describing it as one of the three basic forms of government, along with Monarchy and Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rousseau;Jean-Jacques Rousseau;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rousseau_desc;Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a French writer and philosopher. Rousseau's many publications provided a central inspiration for the French Revolution. In 'Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men (1754),' Rousseau refuted Hobbes' conception of the Social Contract as being imposed on the masses by the powerful in society, thereby instituting inequality into the civil society. In 'The Social Contract (1762) Rousseau argued against the divine right of monarchs and asserted that sovereignty resides with the people. However, he argued that government must be separate from the legislative power of the sovereignty for the application of laws and that it was the duty of the people to abolish an overreaching government. Under his version of the Social Contract, the people had a right of freedom to withdraw from it except in time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
denis_diderot;Denis Diderot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
denis_diderot_desc;Denis Diderot as a French philosopher and writer best known as a coauthor and editor of the 'Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers' with Jean le Rond d'Alembert between 1751 and 1772. The Encyclopedia was the most comprehensive collection of Enlightenment thought and knowledge in every field from philosophy and the arts to science and technology. Its contributors included Diderot himself and most of his leading cotemporaries including Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau. Diderot's support for religious and political freedoms and the importance of modern science and industry was opposed by the aristoratic society in France. His encyclopedia was officially suppressed in 1759 and he had to complete much of the work on his own thereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immanuel_kant;Immanuel Kant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
immanuel_kant_desc;Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher, highly influential in many fields such as metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics,and political philosophy. He promoted as a central theme of the Enlightenment the application of reason to sujective experiences in order to derive knowledge. Kant published 'The Critique of Pure Reason (1781)' in which he argued for a 'Copernican revolution' in philosophy. Kant's doctrine became known as Transcendental Idealism. Kant believed that humans do not experience the world in a direct way, but in a phenomenal way using our senses. These experiences are thus purely subjective and incapable of comprehension as they are (in and of themselves) until processed through Reason. He stated that concepts of mathematics, space and time were transcendental. That is, they were necessary preconditions for the possibilities of experience. His theories influenced a wide spectrum of thinkers and scientists within many disciplines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
david_hume;David Hume;;;;;;;;;;;;;
david_hume_desc;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian and essayist, highly influential in the fields of empiricism and skepticism. Hume argued in 'A Treatise of Human Nature (1739)' that the psychological basis for human behaviour was desire rather than reason. He rejected the views of Locke that humans were born with innate ideas, believing instead that knowledge is derived solely from direct experience. Hume wrote that moral actions came from passions and were intrisically motivated, rather than derived from Reason. He believed in the compatibility of scientific determinism with the concept of free will. The exercise of liberty in fact requires the uniform physical laws governing the natural world, or else our exercise of free will would be nothing more than an act of chance. Hume influenced a diverse group of contemporary and subsequent writers including William James, Adam Smith and Kant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mary_wollstonecraft;Mary Wollstonecraft;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mary_wollstonecraft_desc;Mary Wollstonecraft was an English philosopher and writer who was an early proponent of women's rights. She criticzed Rousseau's subordination of women to a solely domestic role. In 'Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792)' she argued that women only appeared to be inferior to men due to a lack of education. Wollstonecraft believed in treating men and women equally before God as rational, thinking beings, although she conceded a vague predominance of men in a physical sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cesare_beccaria;Cesare Beccaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cesare_beccaria_desc;Cesare Marquis Beccaria-Bonesana was an Italian jurist and philosopher. He was best known for his 1764 treatise 'On Crime and Punishments.' Beccaria argued against torture and for the abolition of the death penalty. He believed that the state did not possess the right to take lives and because capital punishment was neither a useful nor a necessary deterrent to crime. A number of his principles such as the proportionality and promptness of punishment continue to form the basis of criminal justice in modern societies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thomas_jefferson;Thomas Jefferson;;;;;;;;;;;;;
thomas_jefferson_desc;Thomas Jefferson was one of the 'Founding Fathers' of the United States of America. Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, in which he asserted that all men had "certain inalienable rights." He believed in the paramount importance of individual liberties, and argued that liberty should only be limited insofar as it infringed upon the equal rights and liberties of others. Jefferson served as the Third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809 and worked to limit the power of the federal government, favoring decentralization and protecting the rights of individuals. Jefferson promoted science and education and believed in a wall of separation between church and state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#Psychology Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
psychological_intelligence;Psychological Intelligence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
psychological_intelligence_desc;This is the concurrent development to Experimental Psychology that focuses on the use of measurement and mathematics to classify individuals by their development. Beginning with Sir Francis Galton and continuing through Alfred Binet, Charles Spearman, and others, the study of intelligence would produce many different ways of measuring the mental abilities of people. Intelligence theorists would propose methods by which individuals and society could improve itself; they also inspired darker movements such as the Nazis to try to eliminate those considered unfit. Today's IQ test is the direct legacy of intelligence measurement in psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;
sigmund_freud;Sigmund Freud;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sigmund_freud_desc;Sigmund Freud was an Austrian psychologist who founded the discipline of Psychoanalysis. Freud focused on the unconscious mind, dividing it into the id, ego, and superego. Freud believed that unconscious motivations guided the behavior of his patients and these need to be identified by looking for thoughts and actions that did not fit normal explanation. Manifestation of sexual and aggressive drives were most likely explanations for the differences observed in personality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
carl_jung;Carl Jung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
carl_jung_desc;Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and contemporary of Freud. Jung proposed a second, deeper level of collective unconscious, where a number of universal personality types known as archetypes were formed from patterns of emotions and experiences. Jung pioneered dream analysis, arguing that archetypes, complexes and motives manifested themselves through dreams.

#Social Science Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
auguste_comte;Auguste Comte;;;;;;;;;;;;;
auguste_comte_desc;Isidore Auguste Marie François Xavier Comte was a French philosopher who founded the political and philosophical movement known as Positivism. He is best known for his six-volume work 'TheCourse on Positive Philosophy (1830-1842)' in which he described a law of three stages in the development of the human mind and developed a unifying philosophy of science. Comte's law was a progressive process. The human mind begins by seeking answers to its questions in theology. Mental development passes through a transition stage to a 'positive' or final state, where supernatural or abstract causes are rejected in favor of seeking answers through scientific laws. His accompanying philosophy of science was influential for decades after his death. Within the positivist framework, the interrelation of the various branches of sciences is maintained despite their increasing divergence and level of specialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
th_huxley;Thomas Henry Huxley;;;;;;;;;;;;;
th_huxley_desc;Thomas Henry Huxley was an English biologist, natural scientist and social thinker. Huxley became a passionate adherent and defender of Charles Darwin and the concept of Evolution after reading Darwin's 'Origin of Species.' He famously defeated Archbishop Samuel Wilberforce in an 1860 debate on the Theory of Evolution. Huxley promoted the development of scientific education over religious traditions, coining the term 'agnostic' for his beliefs. He founded the X-Club in 1869 with a group of likeminded scientists and researchers. The X-Club would go on to found the scientific journal Nature in 1869, which still publishes today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bituminous_coal_for_coking;Bituminous Coal for Coking;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bituminous_coal_for_coking_desc;Bituminous coal is a soft form of coal, usually appearing black or dark brown with bright and dark streaks running through deposits. A sedimentary rock formed by compression of peat materials, Bituminous Coal became favored for use as coking coal in iron and steel production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deep_shaft_mining;Deep Shaft Mining;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deep_shaft_mining_desc;Improvements in lighting, transport, and air circulation technology in the latter half of the 19th century allowed shaft mines to reach deeper into the earth than ever before. This permitted a great extraction of mineral resources from the veins in which they were found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
motor_housing_insulation;Motor Housing Insulation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
motor_housing_insulation_desc;Early electric motors were prone to sparking. This made the use of electric tools and machinery unsafe for underground mining due to the greatly increased possibility of starting underground fires and explosions. American mining engineer Henry Beecher Dierdorff invented insulation that could be tightly wrapped around the housing of the electric motor to prevent sparks. This allowed for the safe use of electric cutting tools in the mines for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modern_mine_hoists;Modern Mine Hoists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
modern_mine_hoists_desc;These are hoists with cables and framing made from steel. Powered by electric winding engines, they could raise and lower greater loads from mining shafts. Mines could operate faster and deeper than before, while the electric engine enabled rapid stoppage and reversing of the hoist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conveyor_belt;Conveyor Belt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conveyor_belt_desc;The conveyor belt consisted of two pulleys with a continuous loop of material, powered by a motor transmission. The engineering firm Sandvik of Sweden was producing steel conveyor belts by 1891. Thomas Robins developed a conveyor belt that replaced expensive steel with rubber. In 1905, Thomas Sutcliffe patented the first conveyor belt for use underground. The conveyor belt made it easy to transport ores out of the mines, and was soon adopted by Henry Ford in his new assembly line factories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pneumatic_drill;Pneumatic Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pneumatic_drill_desc;The pneumatic drill is a mechanical drill driven by compressed air. Reciprocating pistons drive the compressed air upwards and down, propelling the drill bit into a surface and then drawing it out again. Pneumatic tools became preferred in the construction and operation of mining shafts and tunnels. Earlier tools had required steam power, and steam power required fire which was too dangerous due to the risk of igniting flammable gases underground. Larger pneumatic drilling machines utilized an external air compressor which could also help to ventilate the underground mines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_shovel;Steam Shovel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_shovel_desc;The steam shovel was the first powered excavating machine. Willia Otis patented an original design in 1839. Early steam shovels were 'partial-swing,' meaning the boom and winch could not rotate a full 360 degrees. Steam shovels became more widespread in the last half of the nineteenth century with the development of steel cables and a full-swing design. Steam shovels operated on railways until the invention of caterpillar tracks, and were heavily involved in the development of large-scale,open-pit mining. 102 steam shovels were employed to excavate the Panama Canal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mine_cutting_machines;Mine Cutting Machines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mine_cutting_machines_desc;The introduction of electricity to mining at the turn of the century permitted the development of new machines that could cut into or along mineral seams. These machines facilitated the extraction of resources by miners. Cutting machines later became sophisticated enough to displace much of the extraction work itself, formerly done by hand mining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Casualty Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
minie_ball;Minié Ball;;;;;;;;;;;;;
minie_ball_desc;The Minié ball is a conical-shaped bullet made of iron and soft lead. It was developed in 1849 by French army captain Claude-Etienne Minié based on the work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne. The Minié bullet solved the problem of designing ammunition for the new muzzle-loaded rifles. The bullet expanded to fit the tight rifling grooves when fired, allowing for a greater muzzle velocity and range of accuracy. The greater speed and weight of the Minié ball meant wounds were more severe and required more amputations as the bullets would tear straight through and shatter muscles, tendons, and bones;;;;;;;;;;;;;
barbed_wire;Barbed Wire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
barbed_wire_desc;Barbed Wire was a late-nineteenth century American invention, used originally to keep herds of cattle fenced in. Barbed Wire became integrated with the trench systems of World War One as it was relatively easy to string up and often survived artillery bombardments and machine gun fire. The sharp barbs caused injury to attacking infantry. Emplacing rows of barbed wire in front of the trench line gave the machine gunners and field batteries time to decimate an attack while it was stuck cutting the wire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
concrete_pillboxes;Concrete Pillboxes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
concrete_pillboxes_desc;These were strongpoints along trench systems often dug into the ground, and serving as a protected emplacement for defending machine guns, riflemen and/or light artillery. The reinforced structure provided protection from grenades and mortar shells as well as the weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
quick_firing_field_guns;Quick-Firing Field Guns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
quick_firing_field_guns_desc;Quick-Firing Field Guns are breech-loaded artillery pieces that combine several characteristics to produce a high rate of fire. Buffer mechanisms and self-contained ammunition limited and then eliminated recoil of the barrel. Innovations in breech technology allowed for rapid reloading of the gun. One of an interrupted-screw or sliding-block system sealed the breech to conserve firing velocity. One of the most successful quick-firing designs was the French 'Canon de 75 modèle 1897.' This 75mm piece could fire fifteen rounds per minute of high-explosive and shrapnel, devastating attacking infantry. Other nations quickly copied the technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indirect_fire_techniques;Indirect Fire Techniques;;;;;;;;;;;;;
indirect_fire_techniques_desc;Indirect fire involves aiming and firing artillery projectiles on targets not in a direct line of sight. The degree of accuracy achieved is dependent on calculations of the azimuth (an angular measurement of the target point relative to the reference point) and firing elevation of the gun. The first practical manual was written in 1882 by a Russian officer, KG Guk. Guk described how to fix aiming points for firing arcs using geometry. The lack of a device to measure azimuth was solved in 1890 when Germany introduced the lining-plane. The lining-plane was mounted in-line with the bore and enabled the measurement of large angles. The effectiveness of indirect fire increased greatly with actual battlefield experience in the First World War. The introduction of airborne spotters in balloons and aircraft allowed for gun crews to correct their firing calculations during battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

military_psychology_desc;Military psychology is the research, design and application of psychological theories and experimentation data towards understanding, predicting and countering behaviors either in friendly or enemy forces or civilian populations that may be undesirable, threatening or potentially dangerous to the conduct of military operations. Military psychology is applied towards counseling and treatment of stress and fatigue of military personnel or military families as well as treatment of psychological trauma suffered as a result of military operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

torpedo_tactics_desc;Cruisers and torpedo boats are now equipped with torpedoes. Making the best use of this new weapon requires us to re-think the tactics we use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
torpedo_training_school;Torpedo Training School;;;;;;;;;;;;;
torpedo_training_school_desc;As the use of the torpedo grew, it became necessary to have officers and men who knew the weapon in detail. So navies set up Torpedo Training Schools to produce specialists in this weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
torpedo_night_training;Torpedo Night Training;;;;;;;;;;;;;
torpedo_night_training_desc;The advent of quick-firing guns meant it was difficult for a torpedo boat or destroyer to get close enough to a battleship to fire a torpedo. However, at night, a torpedo flotilla could approach battleships unawares. Night training makes torpedo craft more lethal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
heater_torpedo;Heater Torpedo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
heater_torpedo_desc;The first torpedoes were powered by compressed air. However, we have now discovered a way to use the air to ignite kerosene fuel. This makes our torpedoes faster and longer-ranged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

compressed_oxygen_torpedo_desc;A torpedo fueled with compressed oxygen, like the Japanese "Long Lance", has even greater range and speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cruiser_gun_casemates;Cruiser Gun Casemates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cruiser_gun_casemates_desc;Cruisers tended to have less protection for their gun crews than battleships did. It was impractical to put the guns of a small cruiser in turrets until well into the 20th century. However mounting some guns in a casemate between decks provides good protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
harvey_steel_armour;Harvey Steel Armor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
harvey_steel_armour_desc;The 'Harvey process' produced case-hardened armor, which was more difficult to penetrate. 7.75in of Harvey steel provided the same protection as  12in of regular steel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
krupp_steel_armour;Krupp Cemented Steel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
krupp_steel_armour_desc;Krupp Cemented Steel uses a 'gas cementing' process to produce thick steel armor with a very tough face. This 'KC' Steel became the standard for battleships in the 20th century. It was twice as effective against armor-piercing shells as plain steel plate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

salvo_firing;Salvo Firing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
salvo_firing_desc;To judge the range of an enemy ship and calculate a firing solution, our ships now use "salvo firing": they fire a salvo of three to five shells, wait to see the splashes, and adjust accordingly. Once we know we have the enemy ship 'straddled' we open fire with all guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ap_capped_shell;Armor Piercing Shell;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ap_capped_shell_desc;We now use carefully-designed armor-piercing shells, with a cemented steel point and a high-explosive filling. This is more effective against modern armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
aero_ap_shell;Aerodynamic Armor Piercing Capped Shell;;;;;;;;;;;;;
aero_ap_shell_desc;Research shows that putting a cap of soft metal over the point of an armor-piercing shell makes it more effective. However, this makes the shell less aerodynamic. So on top of that cap we now put another light steel cap to preserve the aerodynamics of the shell. This all means our battleships have unprecedented armor-piercing power at very long ranges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_auxiliaries;Steam Auxiliaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_auxiliaries_desc;The first steam ships in the navies of the 19th Century were not warships but tugs, dredgers and dispatch ships. By freeing sailing ships from constraints of tide and wind, these auxiliary ships make our fleets faster and more flexible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
triple_expansion_engine;Triple-Expansion Steam Engine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
triple_expansion_engine_desc;A Triple-Expansion Steam Engine divides the work of expanding the charge of steam by feeding it through three cylinders of increasing diameter. This served to lessen the magnitude of the heating and cooling process on the engine, a major source of inefficiency. Triple-Expansion engines were more efficient and generated increased speed for the new steel warships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
quadruple_expansion;Quadruple-Expansion Steam Engines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
quadruple_expansion_desc;Adding yet another expansion chamber to a triple-expansion steam engine gave another marginal increase in power and efficiency to steam engines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

levee_en_masse;Levée en Masse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
levee_en_masse_desc;This was a term coined during the French Revolution to describe the mass conscription of able-bodied men in the defense of France. Mass mobilization was not a new idea in historical terms, but the Levée was a modern application of the Enlightenment idea of the national citizen replacing that of the royal subject. The Levée heralded the dramatic expansion of armies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

total_war_mobilisation;Total War Mobilization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
total_war_mobilisation_desc;The slaughter of the Great War and the endless demand for more men and more munitions had forced governments to mobilize the resources of the state as never before. Government intervention in the economy occured on a scale not yet seen in the Industrial Age. The Powers, expecting the next war to be a repeat of the first, trained ever greater numbers of the population as reservists. The economy would be placed on a "total war" footing in anticipation of demands upon private industry for the war effort, even though less men would be available to work in the factories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Ideology Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
social_democracy;Social Democracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
social_democracy_desc;Democratic Socialism grew out of the revolutionary Socialist movement in the late Nineteenth Century. Some socialists remained revolutionary, and advocated the end of Market Capitalism in favor of complete state control of capital and the means of production. Social Democrats instead advocated the Social Welfare or 'Mixed Economy' state. In this version of Social Democracy, certain key services and industries might be nationalized, and the state would provide many social services and programs. However, market forces would continue to function. Political Parties advocating socialist policies, including the SPD in Germany and Labour in Britain became powerful in the parliaments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
marxism_leninism;Marxism-Leninism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
marxism_leninism_desc;Marxism-Leninism was a further development of the Marxist theory described by Marx and Engels. As the name attests, it was originally propounded by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Lenin espoused the concept of the Vanguard Party. Marxist-Leninists rejected Democratic Socialism's peaceful, parliamentary path to socialism. They argued instead argued for immediate and violent revolution. Lenin wrote 'What is to Be Done?' in 1903, in which he described how a dedicated core of revolutionaries could take over in nations where a large, educated proletariat did not already exist. In 1917, Lenin launched a revolution in Russia with a mix of soldier, worker, and peasant support, where a collection of 'Soviets' unde the leadership of Lenin's revolutionary vanguard usurped and then replaced the functions of the traditional state authorities. Marxism-Leninism never realized the utopian withering away of the state as Marx had envisioned. The revolutionary Dictatorship of the Proletariat became a dominant social class of its own. Membership in the Communist Party meant a standard of living  and power above that of the 'proletariat' whom the revolution had been proclaimed for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
national_socialism;National Socialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
national_socialism_desc;National Socialism was an extreme form of the ideology of Fascism, which grew out of global instability after the Great War. National Socialists started with the basic tenets of Fascism, including the Leadership Principle, the Police State, a mass movement, the suppression of Democratic institutions and the subordination of industry and labor to the state. They added ideas derived from social-Darwinism, Eugenics, and Ultranationalist thinkers. This produced a highly toxic and perverted ideology that promised to make the national community or 'Volk' healthy, strong, and dominant. Along with traditional racism towards non-whites, members of minority religions, Eastern European cultures, and especially the Jews were to be forcibly deported, encouraged to emigrate, sterilized, or simply exterminated.'Racial Science' determined them to be inferior not only socially and culturally, but also biologically. National Socialist or 'Nazi' movements primarily sprung up in 'Western' states in the first half of the Twentieth Century, though Japan developed its own theories of race akin to the Nordic 'Aryan' superman based on the 'Yamato' Culture. Communism was the great ideological enemy of the National Socialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_one_party_state;The One Party State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_one_party_state_desc;Politically, while a varying amount of factionalism and competition for power and ideas could be (and WAS) tolerated behind closed doors, there could be no organized opposition in public, to the Party, or to the 'Revolution,' or the 'Movement,' depending on the Fascist or Communist usage. In practice this meant various measures of popular indoctrination, legal or violent repression of the political opposition, and varying levels of persecution against non-party social and religious groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
totalitarianism_desc;The suppression of the basic institutions and rights of a democratic society became one of the first goals of Fascist and Communist states. Parliaments were abolished or made rubber stamps for state decrees and programs. Elections and Plebiscites (if held at all) were no longer secret-ballot: any citizens who opposed were virtually forced to vote the party line, or face punishment in prison or even in Gulags/Concentration Camps. The Press was censored, or more often became another state organ for the dissemination of propaganda extolling the regime's virtues and demonizing its enemies. Freedom of expression in academia, in the world of culture and in the public sphere was curtailed. Professors, scientists and professionals were willingly or unwillingly conscripted to serve the state's priorities. Many intellectuals became emigres and moved to other democratic nations, because to stay and refuse to serve meant incarceration or death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_leadership_principle;The Leadership Principle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_leadership_principle_desc;Fascism rejected assumptions that all were born with the ability to be leaders through popular revolution or election to democratic office. The 'Leadership Principle' affirmed that the state would be led by a group of individuals who were 'gifted to rule.' This introduced an appointed hierarchy in civil society which resembled that of the military. An Italian essay on the 'Doctrine of Fascism' stated: 'the conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State 'a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values' interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.' This hierarchical organization demanded total obedience to those above the individual. Fascism typically gave rise to one supreme leader who would assume a special title, such as that of Fuhrer or Duce. This rule by decree often led to instability and inefficiency, as those most loyal might be chosen over those most able. Those who broke with the hierarchical structure and created their own organizations and leadership power in the state might even receive attention and praise in the Fascist appreciation for the constant national struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;
ultranationalism_n_the_volk;Ultranationalism and The Volk;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ultranationalism_n_the_volk_desc;Ultranationalism encouraged a form of collectivism that unlike Marxism, emphasized national unity through ethnicity or 'race.' Fascists believed in a state free of class struggle, National organizations were formed for the various economic classes, who all worked for the benefit of the nation. This was known as Corporatism. National Socialist variants rejected definitions based on mere national 'feeling' or 'myth.' Their definitions of belonging were based on the lines of racial protectionism or racial supremacy; This concept of the 'Volk' stated that traditional definitions of who belonged to the national state were inadequate. A German whose ancestors had lived in Germany and spoke German for centuries could be excluded from the national community if they were Jewish, joined the political opposition, or had ancestors from 'inferior' nationalities. Italian and other variants emphasized the concept of humankind as in constant struggle, and some conquered peoples could be assimilated into the nation. National Socialism emphasized a racial imperialism, whereby new territory was to be conquered, cleansed of inferior peoples, and colonized by the 'Volk.';;;;;;;;;;;;
the_classless_society;The Classless Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_classless_society_desc;The coming to power of Communist movements usually meant that the 'intelligentsia' - academics, the political opposition, businessmen, aristocrats and large landowners, even army officers - were purged, driven into exile, or killed as being opposed to the revolution. The Communist state promoted the idea of the classless society, where everyone was a comrade in the service of the State. Organized religion and ethnic nationalism were often brutally suppressed, because they could provide foci for anti-regime activities and armed resistance. The armed forces were not only often deprived of leadership in purges, but traditional military symbols that inspired the army were removed in favor of empty Marxist slogans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cover_the_senne_desc;The Senne River flows through the centre of Brussels. By 1860 the accumulation of waste in the river came to pose a significant health risk to the population. Residents preferred to move out of the city and live in the suburbs, thus depriving the city of tax revenues. In 1865 the architect Léon-Pierre Suys presented a plan to divert the Senne through specially constructed tunnels under the centre of the city. The exposed riverbed would be covered over and a series of 4 grand boulevards were to be laid out. Construction started in 1867 and was completed in 1871. While the new buildings failed to attract suburban residents back to the city, public health was measurably improved and transport congestion eased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME123412346;Literacy Fix for Austrian Italians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123412346;This event increases the literacy rating for North Italian POPs in Austria to be close to the prevailing historical literacy rate in Northern Italy, such as the independent North Italian minors already start with. As North Italian is not an accepted culture for Austria, POPs of that culture have to otherwise get the generic 10% literacy rate for unaccepted POPs instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME123412347;Literacy Fix for Hungarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123412347;This event increases the literacy rating for Hungarian POPs within the modern-day borders of Hungary from 10% to 25%. 25% is the estimated average literacy in the Austrian Empire for 1836. As Hungarian is not an accepted culture for Austria, POPs of that culture have to otherwise get the generic 10% literacy rate for unaccepted POPs instead. When coupled with the Italian fix, raising Hungarian literacy to a more historical level allows Austria to have the literacy rating promised in the country file, to no longer operate under a handicap they should not have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME123412348;Literacy Fix for French Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123412348;This event increases the literacy rating for European minorities to be closer to the prevailing historical literacy rate in mainland France for the time, around 50%  As these are not otherwise accepted cultures for France, they have previously received the generic 10% literacy rate for unaccepted POPs, a value meant more for France's overseas minorities like the Arabs and Africans. This event will give the minorities a literacy rate of 40%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME123412349;Literacy Fix for the Irish;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123412349;This event increases the literacy rating for Irish POPs in the United Kingdom to 30%. As Irish is not accepted by the United Kingdom, the POPs had been receiving the default 10% literacy rate reserved for unaccepted POPs. Real literacy in Ireland was likely at least 30% on average by 1836, and the 10% value severely dragged the in-game literacy rating of the United Kingdom down from the historical 53% or so to 43%. This reduce some of the unwarranted handicap upon the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME21530;Yellow River Flood of 1851;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21530;The Mandate of Heaven was a belief held by the Chinese of the right for the Manchu house to rule China. As long as the ruler was upright and virtuous, Heaven was appeased. If the ruler became wicked and corrupt, then Heaven would withdraw its Mandate and make it known to the people through disasters. In 1851, the Yellow River breached the north embankment near Kaifeng Prefecture in Honan and caused great devastation over the countryside of North China. It required some fifteen or more years to repair damages from this outbreak, and to confine the stream with new embankments. These disasters were indication to the Chinese people that the Manchurians were losing the Mandate of Heaven, the right to rule and govern China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA21530;We are losing the Mandate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21530_NEWS_TITLE;Yellow River Flood of 1851;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21530_NEWS_LONG;The Yellow River, China's second longest, overran its north embankment in the Kaifeng Prefecture of the Honan province. The system of dykes and levees previouisly maintained to control river flooding has failed. Extensive loss of life and damage to crops and buildings has been reported. The flooding spread throughout the North China Plain. Everywhere, voices murmured that the Qing Emperor was losing his Mandate from Heaven, the divine right to rule. Discontent began to spread everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21530_NEWS_MEDIUM;The Yellow River in North China overran its north embankment in Kaifeng Prefecture, breaking the system of dykes and levees. Extensive loss of life and damage to crops and buildings has been reported. The Emperor's Mandate from Heaven has been shaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME21540;Yellow River Flood of 1887;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21540;The Yellow River changed course in 1855, emptying into the Yellow Sea north of the Shantung Peninsula rather than to the south of it. In 1887 a rising river coupled with a prolonged period of heavy rain caused the river to first burst through dikes near Chengchow, in Honan province. The river subsequently flooded the plains of North China much as it had done in 1855, causing massive deaths, and bringing disease and famine in its wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA21540;A Disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME21540_NEWS_TITLE;Yellow River Flood of 1887;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21540_NEWS_LONG;With the Yellow River rising, a prolonged period of heavy rain triggered the Yellow River to breach its dykes and embankments again in 1887. The flooding is reported to have begun near Chengchow, in the Honan province. Destruction and loss of life once more envelop the North China Plain. The flooding river has changed its course since 1851, now emptying into the Yellow Sea north of the Shantung province and bringing its catastrophic effects closer to the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21540_NEWS_MEDIUM;Heavy rains triggered the rising Yellow River to breach its dykes again in 1887. The floods began near Chengchow in Honan province, spreading through the North China plain much as in 1851. Massive damage and loss of life has been reported once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME21550;Yellow River Flood of 1931;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC21550;China suffered a prolonged drought from 1928 until 1930. Through the end of 1930 and into 1931, abnormally heavy winter snowstorms and spring/summer rains once more caused the Yellow River to rise significantly, flooding over its banks. The Yangtzee and Huai rivers would also later flood their banks as well, affecting over 28 million people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
