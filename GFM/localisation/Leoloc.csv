prop_up_french_bourbons_desc;§RGain 10 infamy§!Considering our recent gains in France, our advisors have suggested we press the Bourbon claims on France once again, allowing us to have a faithful ally  in the northern border. That would pose a challenge, obviously, as the French people have made clear they don't accept the king's divine rule and will eventually cause us more problems, but stabilizing France sounds better than having to fight them over the Bourbon claim forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80432214;We beat those Spaniards back and finally stamped out the Bourbon menace. For their crimes they will be put to death, the Spanish shall recede behind the pyrenees and shrink in the medeteranian sea to where they belong. Glory to France! Glory to the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80432215;With our defeat in the French royalist insurection we have been forced to hand over our holdings in France and forfeit any claims to their throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80432216;The Bourbons now celebrate victory among the great halls of Versailles, the coronation of the great divine sovereign of France commences with lavish decoration and oppulent food. While the nationalists may have been stemmed for now the Spanish lineage watches over the dynasty closely, ensuring that relations and revolutions stay contained and eliminated, all while allowing control over all teritorries the nationalists held abroad. Today is certainly a day of change for both France and Europe as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80432217;Within the great halls of Versailles lays the coronation of the divine sovereign of France, silent and orderly as the standard festivities are less in demand. While the rightful king is placed in power of France and her great destiny his auhtority is certainly questionable as the illegitimate government's holdings fall under the tight grasp of the Spanish lineage. Today is the mark of an iron age for France...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC80432219;With our victory over the usurpers secured we can finally place the French lineage of our dynasty in power to the north. The usurpers did manage to take quite a large colonial empire abroad and could be just compensation for our help in securing Bourbon control over France... Or perhaps its time for the power dynamic to be flipped on it's head with Spanish domination of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
