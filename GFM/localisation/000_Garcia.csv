general_colonization_law_desc;The General Colonization Law was a political reform imposed in 1824. Its purpose was to attract immigrants to the least populated areas of our nation.

EVTDESC4207008;GFM has added a mechanic for straits that prevents passing them if both sides are controlled by a country you are at war with. For example, to the left there's the Strait of Gibraltar. Movement from sea tile A to sea tile C and vice versa is impossible if both control tiles, Tetouan and Gibraltar, labeled with a modifier, are controlled by an enemy country. However, a side effect of this system is that ships will, unless the strait is blocked by enemy control tiles, not actually pass through the province in the middle of the strait, in this case B. So, if you want to place a navy to engage enemy fleets, do so in front of or behind the strait, in this case on tile A or C. \n \n The renaming mechanic has been reworked to be an event due to speed reasons, and now you have the option to choose how often you want renaming to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

zollverein_title;The Zollverein;;;;;;;;;;;;;
zollverein_desc;The Zollverein is a proposed organization of German States managing tariffs and economic policies in unison inspired by the creation of a variety of custom unions among some German states in 1818. The foundation of the Zollverein would be the first instance in history in which independent states form a full economic union without the simultaneous creation of a political federation or union. This could help our nation to assert our influence above the accepting German states and make the economy of the German people more dynamic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207013;The Prussian government has approached us requesting our integration into the Zollverein, a customs union among the German states of Europe. The Zollverein is purely a customs union and does not involve in any way the sovereignty of the nation. However, it could also mean that we are kneeling to Prussian influence. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207014;Mexico has attacked our territories in Soconusco and begun de facto annexing the region. They demand that Guatemalan forces do not intervene or they will begin an all-out war. It's time for us to decide whether to go to war with Mexico or to simply allow them to occupy the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207015;The Definitive Restoration Plan, a proposal by conservatives to restore the Mexican Empire, has been issued. It would create a constitutional monarchy following 4 important principles:\n1. The Mexican Nation is and will be independent, sovereign, and will for the third time take the heroic title of 'Imperio de Anáhuac'.\n2. The Empire's religion is and will be Apostolic and Roman Catholicism, without tolerance for other religions.\n3. Mexico's form of government will be a hereditary constitutional monarchy, conducive to the preservation of our culture and the fulfillment of the needs of our country.\n4. Agustín Jerónimo de Iturbide is proclaimed Emperor of Mexico. If he does not accept, the crown will be passed to Antonio de Hero y Tamaríz. In case he also refuses, the new emperor will be elected by our courts.\nWhat should we do? This may be our last opportunity to appease the increasingly bellicose conservative opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207016;'Slavery and caste distinctions are outlawed for ever, and may everyone be equal.' -José María Morelos y Pavón. Mexican officer during the Mexican War for Independence and national hero.\n\nThe Underground Railway to Mexico is a network that helps thousands of slaves to escape into Mexico. Because of our constitution, every slave that sets foot in Mexican soil is considered free, and for many former Afro-American slaves of the American South, escaping to Mexico has been their salvation. Although there have been considerably more slaves crossing the Mason-Dixon line, some others even escaped into Canada. With the USA having passed the Fugitive Slave Act, it's clear that fleeing slaves are safe nowhere in the entirety of the US. An approximate 10,000 slaves have crossed the border into Mexico throughout this period, although data is unclear as many of the convoys tend to not be spotted and some are recaptured by slave patrols before making it into Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207017;The Tordesillas Treaty had several modifications throughout history, we could decide on these two options, one claiming the entirety of the Amazons and one for claiming only the Western part of the Amazons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207019;Economic and territorial issues related to the land between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers along with the Dawson Massacre give us the perfect pretext for sending an expedition into northern Mexico to conquer the land we claim. However, this may not go too well and would risk war with the Mexicans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207020;Texas has launched an raid into the land it claims between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers in the North of our country dubbed the 'Mier Expedition'. They apparently justify the attack as revenge for the 'Dawson Massacre', although its primary purpose is clearly gaining control of the land they claim. The expedition is rather small and its members undisciplined, so it should be a matter of ease to send them scurrying back across the border. The question is whether we should follow them, escalating the raid into a full-scale war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207021;Hundreds of Irish and German soldiers have begun deserting from the American forces to join our army. This is due to the constant mistreatment directed at Catholic soldiers by Protestants considering them closer to Rome than to Washington and thus more aligned with Catholic Mexico, a country of their own religion. The deserters have formed an organized force, dubbed "Saint Patrick's Battalion", under General John O' Riley to join our army. The flag they raise is not Mexican but Irish, a golden harp on a green background with the words "Erin Go Bragh" ("Ireland for ever") on the other side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bad_mexican_army_desc;The Mexican Army is hardly an organization. It's a weak and divided force, and not everyone is committed to the army. The army has no motivation, no training, no practice. On top of this, the army itself is divided between the permanent forces and the active militiamen. There's hardly any organization in the Mexican military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207022;A linguist by the name of Joaquín García Icazbalceta has compiled a dictionary named 'El Vocabulario de Mexicanísmos' (The 'Mexicanisms' Vocabulary) published by his son Luís García Pimentel.

For his work, García Icazbalceta used a several old and contemporary Spanish dictionaries to confirm potential mexicanisms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207023;The San Andres Explosion is an accident that has recently occurred in San Andrés Chalchicomula, Puebla. In the accident, 1017 soldiers lost their life along with 25 officers, 40 civilian passerby and an unknown number of women and children accompanying the soldiers. The accident occurred when local authorities decided to move gunpowder and other gun supplies to the Guadalupe temple on the edge of the city so that the San Andrés cellar could supply the First Oaxaca Brigade. Some swear to have seen a spark coming out of the deposit of gunpowder which caused the explosion. The explosion occurred at 8:12PM. While the gunpowder store held its own due to its massive 3-meter-wide walls, nearby houses were instantly destroyed and many houses in a larger radius were sometimes often damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207024;Although railroad concessions have been made since 1837, only now has the megaproject of building a railroad network to connect our capital to the port of Veracruz come to fruition. Going through various cities like Tulancingo, Querétaro, Córdoba, Jalapa and others, the railroad advances our nation's industry and makes the transportation of goods shipped in from overseas cheaper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207025;In its recent decision to reform the constitution through a recent decree called the 'Leyes de Reforma', the federal government has decided on the official tolerance of protestantism while also prohibiting religious acts outside its temples. This reform has provoked a catholic uprising in Morelia, Zinacantepec, Hidalgo, León, Jonacatepec, Temascaltepec and Tejupilco. Thankfully, these revolts have failed to gather enough forces and can be suppressed quickly, but the populace is in turmoil, especially in conservative, catholic, rural communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207036;Los Reformistas managed to take full control of Mexico City, in which they captured the President Anastasio Bustamante and did not hesitate about executing him. With this outcome, many Conservative troops have been entirely demoralized and support in the south has increased. With the capital and the nation's heartland under Guerrero's control, there's only one way the nation can proceed without falling appart, a new Presidential term for Vicente Guerrero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_frontier_title;The Mexican North;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mexican_frontier_desc;Northern history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities and the nation itself, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states. It is a tale of war, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to Mexico.\n\nSeveral of our northern forts and posts have grown through the years, while several others were abandoned and new cities took their place. The Mexican North has been tamed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207038;Several decades have passed since the start and end of the Texan Revolution. The struggle and the confusion of the Texan peoples between self-governing, the slavery controversy, and Santa Anna's ruthless rule over the territory are now all gone. Now Texas is an integral part of our country and we expect it to stay that way, for ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207039;The Caste War, the bloody conflict that has been taking place for years in the Yucatan peninsula can be considered finished, extended rights to the Mayan peoples, numerous grants of land, money and key roles in the local government have finally pacified the grudges in the Yucatan peninsula, for ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the Mexicans weak and unable to defend, we can impose our claim and bring the Americans in the area back into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207041;Some among our cabinet have been discussing the possibility of sending an offer to the British regarding our border with their province of Manitoba. The plan is to offer them the lands we hold East of the Mississippi in what once was the American Minnesota in exchange for a small strip of land above the 49th parallel, which is part of the Mississippi River watershed and has a more defensible terrain. This could, of course, help us improve relations with the British, who would be getting more land out of the deal, if we can come to an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207042;The Mexican Embassy has approached us to discuss the possibility of a land exchange in our Canadian border. Apparently, they are willing to give us their lands east of the Mississippi River Watershed in exchange for a small strip of land we hold above the 49th parallel. The lands they offer sure are worth more than the ones we would let go, we should probably consider what our response will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207043;As a result of the recent election, Anastasio Bustamante has been elected to the presidency. His eight-year term will last from 1837 to 1845. As president, he has the power to name a temporary interim president to take his role momentarily. Historically, this power has been used multiple times when presidents had to lead an army against rebels and needed to leave government in the hands of a capable stand-in. General Santa Anna has now returned to his post as general, ready to serve, but he surely will attempt to seize power again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207044;In the Sonoran town of Arizpe, José de Urrea, a renowned general who fought in the Zacatecas Rebellion, has proclaimed the re-establishment of the federal regime, and has overthrown the government of the Department of Sonora y Sinaloa. We have been alerted that he has started moving his troops down South to Mazatlán. De Urrea and other liberals flocking to join his rebellion reject the conservative central government established in 1835, the same sentiment that caused the revolts in Zacatecas and Texas. We must take action to squash federalism for good lest it returns to be a thorn in our side once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207045;News has reached us that general Paredes y Arrillaga has crushed the insurrection in a decisive battle in Mazatlán. The Federalist rebels are now defeated, and José de Urrea has been captured and imprisoned. However, his strategic skill could prove useful to the military, and it would be better for us to give him a second chance as an officer, especially since more Federalist revolts are brewing elsehwere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207046;After our success in overthrowing the unitarian government, federalism is now supreme throughout our nation. It is now time to enact a new constitution based on the Constitution of 1824 and bring peace and union back to our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207047;In a surprising change of events, after a series of revolts in Guadalajara, Veracruz and Mexico City itself, the government of Anastasio Bustamante has once again been deposed by a combined force of General Antonio López de Santa Anna, Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga and General Gabriel Valencia (almost a repetition of Bustamante's deposal in 1832). They have declared the "Bases of Tacubaya", a reform to our current constitution. Additionally, they have condemned Bustamante's rule as authoritarian and have replaced his administration with a new cabinet and congress. Santa Anna has been made the provisional president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207049;After interim president Nicolás Bravo's dissolution of congress, he replaced it with the Junta de Notables. This new cabinet has enacted a new reform to the constitution, called the "Organic Bases". This has essentially strengthened unitarianism even more, and reduced the political rights of our citizens. Santa Anna is now what could be considered as a dictator, and we can only hope that this is the best choice for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207050;Since the reinstatement of the 1824 Constitution during the Mexican-American War which brought back federalism to unify our nation, the government under President Mariano Arista has become increasingly unpopular. The unitarians have been plotting a coup d'etat for a while and have, with the support of General Santa Anna, finally overthrown the federalist government. Antonio López de Santa Anna is in power once again. §RDon't be afraid, he won't last long in power.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207051;After having deposed Anastasio Bustamante and taken charge of the presidency, Antonio López de Santa Anna, a staunch unitarian, tried to convince the newly assembled senate to not revert Mexico to a federalist state. However, he failed in this undertaking, as the new senate is overwhelmingly liberal. Santa Anna then resigned and went to his hacienda to sulk, but ordered the new interim president, Nicolás Bravo, to dissolve congress and prevent a new federalist constitution. Nicolás Bravo, a unitarian, is against the prospect of Mexico returning to the federal system. On the other hand, he also detests Santa Anna. After much contemplation and hesitation, Bravo opted to follow Santa Anna's order and dissolved the congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207052;The Mexicans have proposed to us a treaty in which, if we accept, we would be surrendering all of our claims and demands in any land lost in the Mexican-American War as well as 100,000 dollars for reparations. This could be a great opportunity to boost relations with the Mexicans but it would make our patriots feel betrayed by their own nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207053;The Americans have accepted our treaty, and now finally the Mexican soil is free of foreign claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the American government apparently still considers it an integral part of their nation. We can propose a treaty to them, and offer them money in exchange for the recognition of absolute Mexican rule over the territory. This could at best settle our differences forevermore, or at worst simply infuriate them further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207055;Our holdings in Texas are entering a period of rapid population growth, as modern infrastructure and development has spurred waves of migrants and settlements. Rich in agricultural resources, the so-called "Great Desert" is becoming dotted with homesteads and boom towns. Even the Llano Estacado has been tamed as cattlehands push their herds into the wide open fields once under Comanche control. Meanwhile to the east, large crops of cotton are harvested alongside hay and grain. What were once small frontier posts are growing up to become large cities, and massive infrastructure projects are narrowing the gaps across the massive region. Everything's getting bigger in Texas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
texas_boom_small;Good Ol' Texas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207056;After recent reports from General Manuel Mier y Terán, it has been decided that measures to encourage immigration to Texas and other areas must be ended. While the goal of this law is not to prevent immigration, it will cancel the benefits immigrants used to receive upon arrival in the desolate lands of the North to incentivize settling there. The reason for these measures is the protection of our sovereignty in the North. Regions like Texas have been increasingly dominated by anglophone American immigrants who agitate for unification with the United States. We can only hope that this will lead to America's influence in our northern territories declining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207057;After several past attempts to repatriate Emperor Napoleon I's mortal remains back to France, the new Président du Conseil Adolphe Thiers has pursued the return of the Emperor to France as a grand political coup de théâtre which would definitively achieve the rehabilitation of the Revolutionary and Imperial periods. Past attempts failed due to the active political turmoil of the time which would have inevitably created unrest among the population. Even in 1821 after Napoleon's death, the French King Louis XVIII refused because of these circumstances. But now almost 20 years later, it is a calm enough era in the French nation, and the debate about if Napoleon's body should be returned to France is still at bail. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207058;The French ambassador has reached us to negotiate about the possible returnal of Napoleon I's remains to France from Saint Helena. This could improve our diplomatic relations with the French, as well as maybe mark am end to the revolutionary era in Europe, for now. Napoleon's remains are still in Saint Helena since the day he died. If we accept the French agree to carry out the transport of the body themselves and with that, everything will be over. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207059;The United Kingdom has agreed on the repatriation of Napoleon's remains. It is now our due to send a convoy to Saint Helena to retrieve the body safely, the designated ship for this travesy is the frigate Belle Poule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many Afro-Mexicans, descendants of the slaves that were declared free in 1810 with the Declaration of Independence, still live in disproportionately poor conditions and face racial discrimination. This systemic racism and inequality is a shame to our nation. Evidently having had a black mestizo president, Vicente Guerrero, has not significantly reduced racism and the other challenges that many Afro-Mexicans must face on a daily basis. With more Afro-Latinos in our nation due to our conquests, it is not only fair, but necessary to embrace, integrate and accept them as equals. The time has come to wipe out racism and ensure that our people are forevermore judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207064;If Italy were committed to colonizing the land surrounding the Strait of Sicily, a major setback has come in reaching that goal. Prime Minister Benedetto Cairoli has aspired during his term to conquer the Beylik of Tunis for Italy--though the small North African country is now under French control.\n\nShould Italy wish to justify its claim to Tunis, it need not look further than practical reasons. It's only natural for Italy to control both sides of the Strait of Sicily--thereby halting the other colonial powers wishing to control all of North Africa at once. For us to relinquish the claim to Tunis would be to turn the other cheek after being slapped in the face.

EVTDESC4207066;Colombia's workers rights movement faces a devastating blow today as a massacre of protesting United Fruit Company employees came to light. After a strike in Ciénaga begun, in which workers demanded reforms such as ending hiring through sub-contractors and raising pay, the corporation's private army and the Colombian military fired on potentially thousands of workers. General Cortés Vargas is liable, per his own claim, for 47 workers' murders, though the exact number of casualties is unknown. Soldiers individually report having thrown the dead into the sea or buried them in mass graves. All this because of a collaboration between American business interests and the Colombian government to root out so-called "communist" elements.

This is great news to our cause but it also means we will have to tone down our expectations in order to mantain peace and not enrage the conservatives even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUERREROCAPTURED;Our plan to capture Vicente Guerrero, by luring him into the Columbus ship commandeered by Genovese captain Francesco Picaluga has surprisingly worked! Guerrero is now on his way to Huatulco, where our forces are prepared to incarcerate him and execute him after a "proper" trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
