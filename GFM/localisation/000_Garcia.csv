EVTDESC4207008;GFM has added a mechanic for straits that prevents passing them if both sides are controlled by a country you are at war with. For example, here's the Strait of Gibraltar. Movement from sea tile A to sea tile B and vice versa is impossible if both control tiles, Tetouan and Gibraltar, are controlled by an enemy country. These control tiles have a province modifier labeling them so that their function is clear. However, a side effect of this system is that ships will, unless the strait is blocked by enemy control tiles, not actually pass through the province in the middle of the strait, in this case B. So, if you want to place a navy to engage enemy fleets who want to pass through the strait in battle, do so in front of or behind the strait, in this case on tile A or C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207013;The Prussian government has approached us requesting our integration into the Zollverein, a customs union among the German states of Europe. The Zollverein is purely a customs union and does not involve in any way the sovereignty of the nation. However, it could also mean that we are kneeling to Prussian influence.

EVTDESC4207015;The Definitive Restoration Plan, a proposal by conservatives to restore the Mexican Empire, has been issued. It would create a constitutional monarchy following 4 important principles:\n1. The Mexican Nation is and will be independent, sovereign, and will for the third time take the heroic title of 'Imperio de Anáhuac'.\n2. The Empire's religion is and will be Apostolic and Roman Catholicism, without tolerance for other religions.\n3. Mexico's form of government will be a hereditary constitutional monarchy, conducive to the preservation of our culture and the fulfillment of the needs of our country.\n4. Agustín Jerónimo de Iturbide is proclaimed Emperor of Mexico. If he does not accept, the crown will be passed to Antonio de Hero y Tamaríz. In case he also refuses, the new emperor will be elected by our courts.\nWhat should we do? This may be our last opportunity to appease the increasingly bellicose conservative opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because of our constitution, every slave that sets foot in Mexican soil is considered free, and for many former Afro-American slaves of the American South, escaping to Mexico has been their salvation. Although there have been considerably more slaves crossing the Mason-Dixon line, some others even escaped into Canada. With the USA having passed the Fugitive Slave Act, it's clear that fleeing slaves are safe nowhere in the entirety of the US. An approximate 10,000 slaves have crossed the border into Mexico throughout this period, although data is unclear as many of the convoys tend to not be spotted and some are recaptured by slave patrols before making it into Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The accident occurred when local authorities decided to move gunpowder and other gun supplies to the Guadalupe temple on the edge of the city so that the San Andrés cellar could supply the First Oaxaca Brigade. Some swear to have seen a spark coming out of the deposit of gunpowder which caused the explosion. The explosion occurred at 8:12PM.

EVTDESC4207041;Some among our cabinet have been discussing the possibility of sending an offer to the British regarding our border with their province of Manitoba. The plan is to offer them the lands we hold East of the Mississippi in what once was the American Minnesota in exchange for a small strip of land above the 49th parallel, which is part of the Mississippi River watershed and has a more defensible terrain. This could, of course, help us improve relations with the British, who would be getting more land out of the deal, if we can come to an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207042;The Mexican Embassy has approached us to discuss the possibility of a land exchange in our Canadian border. Apparently, they are willing to give us their lands east of the Mississippi River Watershed in exchange for a small strip of land we hold above the 49th parallel.

EVTDESC4207043;As a result of the recent election, Anastasio Bustamante has been elected to the presidency. His eight-year term will last from 1837 to 1845. As president, he has the power to name a temporary interim president to take his role momentarily. Historically, this power has been used multiple times when presidents had to lead an army against rebels and needed to leave government in the hands of a capable stand-in. General Santa Anna has now returned to his post as general, ready to serve, but he surely will attempt to seize power again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207044;In the Sonoran town of Arizpe, José de Urrea, a renowned general who fought in the Zacatecas Rebellion, has proclaimed the re-establishment of the federal regime, and has overthrown the government of the Department of Sonora y Sinaloa. We have been alerted that he has started moving his troops down South to Mazatlán. De Urrea and other liberals flocking to join his rebellion reject the conservative central government established in 1835, the same sentiment that caused the revolts in Zacatecas and Texas. We must take action to squash federalism for good lest it returns to be a thorn in our side once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207045;News has reached us that general Paredes y Arrillaga has crushed the insurrection in a decisive battle in Mazatlán. The Federalist rebels are now defeated, and José de Urrea has been captured and imprisoned.

EVTDESC4207046;After our success in overthrowing the unitarian government, federalism is now supreme throughout our nation. It is now time to enact a new constitution based on the Constitution of 1824 and bring peace and union back to our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207047;In a surprising change of events, after a series of revolts in Guadalajara, Veracruz and Mexico City itself, the government of Anastasio Bustamante has once again been deposed by a combined force of General Antonio López de Santa Anna, Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga and General Gabriel Valencia (almost a repetition of Bustamante's deposal in 1832). They have declared the "Bases of Tacubaya", a reform to our current constitution. Additionally, they have condemned Bustamante's rule as authoritarian and have replaced his administration with a new cabinet and congress. Santa Anna has been made the provisional president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207049;After interim president Nicolás Bravo's dissolution of congress, he replaced it with the Junta de Notables. This new cabinet has enacted a new reform to the constitution, called the "Organic Bases". This has essentially strengthened unitarianism even more, and reduced the political rights of our citizens. Santa Anna is now what could be considered as a dictator, and we can only hope that this is the best choice for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207050;Since the reinstatement of the 1824 Constitution during the Mexican-American War which brought back federalism to unify our nation, the government under President Mariano Arista has become increasingly unpopular. The unitarians have been plotting a coup d'etat for a while and have, with the support of General Santa Anna, finally overthrown the federalist government. Antonio López de Santa Anna is in power once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207051;After having deposed Anastasio Bustamante and taken charge of the presidency, Antonio López de Santa Anna, a staunch unitarian, tried to convince the newly assembled senate to not revert Mexico to a federalist state. However, he failed in this undertaking, as the new senate is overwhelmingly liberal. Santa Anna then resigned and went to his hacienda to sulk, but ordered the new interim president, Nicolás Bravo, to dissolve congress and prevent a new federalist constitution. Nicolás Bravo, a unitarian, is against the prospect of Mexico returning to the federal system. On the other hand, he also detests Santa Anna. After much contemplation and hesitation, Bravo opted to follow Santa Anna's order and dissolved the congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207055;Our holdings in Texas are entering a period of rapid population growth, as modern infrastructure and development has spurred waves of migrants and settlements. Rich in agricultural resources, the so-called "Great Desert" is becoming dotted with homesteads and boom towns. Even the Llano Estacado has been tamed as cattlehands push their herds into the wide open fields once under Comanche control. Meanwhile to the east, large crops of cotton are harvested alongside hay and grain.

EVTDESC4207056;After recent reports from General Manuel Mier y Terán, it has been decided that measures to encourage immigration to Texas and other areas must be ended. While the goal of this law is not to prevent immigration, it will cancel the benefits immigrants used to receive upon arrival in the desolate lands of the North to incentivize settling there. The reason for these measures is the protection of our sovereignty in the North. Regions like Texas have been increasingly dominated by anglophone American immigrants who agitate for unification with the United States. We can only hope that this will lead to America's influence in our northern territories declining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207057;After several past attempts to repatriate Emperor Napoleon I's mortal remains back to France, the new Président du Conseil Adolphe Thiers has pursued the return of the Emperor to France as a grand political coup de théâtre which would definitively achieve the rehabilitation of the Revolutionary and Imperial periods. Past attempts failed due to the active political turmoil of the time which would have inevitably created unrest among the population. Even in 1821 after Napoleon's death, the French King Louis XVIII refused because of these circunstances. But now almost 20 years later, it is a calm enough era in the French nation, and the debate about if Napoleon's body should be returned to France is still at bail. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207058;The French ambassador has reached us to negotiate about the possible returnal of Napoleon I's remains to France from Saint Helena.

This systemic racism and inequality is a shame to our nation. Evidently having had a black mestizo president, Vicente Guerrero, has not significantly reduced racism and the other challenges that many Afro-Mexicans must face on a daily basis. With more Afro-Latinos in our nation due to our conquests, it is not only fair, but necessary to embrace, integrate and accept them as equals.

It's only natural for Italy to control both sides of the Strait of Sicily--thereby halting the other colonial powers wishing to control all of North Africa at once.

After a strike in Ciénaga begun, in which workers demanded reforms such as ending hiring through sub-contractors and raising pay, the corporation's private army and the Colombian military fired on potentially thousands of workers. General Cortés Vargas is liable, per his own claim, for 47 workers' murders, though the exact number of casualties is unknown. Soldiers individually report having thrown the dead into the sea or buried them in mass graves. All this because of a collaboration between American business interests and the Colombian government to root out so-called "communist" elements.
