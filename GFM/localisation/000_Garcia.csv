EVTDESC4207008;GFM has added a mechanic for straits that prevents passing them if both sides are controlled by a country you are at war with. For example, here's the Strait of Gibraltar. Movement from sea tile A to sea tile B and vice versa is impossible if both control tiles, Tetouan and Gibraltar, are controlled by an enemy country. These control tiles have a province modifier labeling them so that their function is clear. However, a side effect of this system is that ships will, unless the strait is blocked by enemy control tiles, not actually pass through the province in the middle of the strait, in this case B. So, if you want to place a navy to engage enemy fleets who want to pass through the strait in battle, do so in front of or behind the strait, in this case on tile A or C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

zollverein_title;The Zollverein;;;;;;;;;;;;;
zollverein_desc;The Zollverein is a proposed organization of German States managing tariffs and economic policies in unison inspired by the creation of a variety of custom unions among some German states in 1818. The foundation of the Zollverein would be the first instance in history in which independent states form a full economic union without the simultaneous creation of a political federation or union. This could help our nation to assert our influence above the accepting German states and make the economy of the German people more dynamic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207013;The Prussian government has approached us requesting our integration into the Zollverein, a customs union among the German states of Europe. The Zollverein is purely a customs union and does not involve in any way the sovereignty of the nation. However, it could also mean that we are kneeling to Prussian influence. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

integrate_chile_pbc_outside_desc;§RGain 2 infamy§! Chile is culturally similar to the Peru-Bolivians and the key to mastering control of the Andes mountains. Integrating them into the union will boost the strenght of the union and serve as a stronger ally for us in South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207014;Mexico, under General Santa Anna has occupied our territories in Soconusco and made a de facto annexation of the land. They demand Guatemalan forces to not intervene or it will be an act of war. It's time for us to decide if going to war against the Mexican government or simply allow them to occupy the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207015;The Definitive Restoration Plan has been proposed by the Conservative party in order to restore the monarchy in Mexico, and creating a constitutional empire following 4 important principles:\n1. The Mexican Nation is and will be independent, sovereign, and will take for the third time the heroic denomination of 'Imperio de Anáhuac'.\n2. The Empire's religion is and will be the apostolic and roman catholicism, without any public tolerance for other religions.\n3. The nation's form of government will be the one of a Constitutional Monarchy, hereditary, according to the habits or cultures and necessities of the country.\n4. The nation proclaims Agustín Jerónimo de Iturbide as the Emperor of Mexico. In case he does not accept, the crown will be for Antonio de Hero y Tamaríz. In case he also does not accept, the Emperor will be elected by the courts.\nWhat should we do? This may be an opportunity to appease the conservative opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207016;'Slavery and caste distinctions are outlawed for ever, and may everyone be equal.' -José María Morelos y Pavón. Mexican officer during the Mexican War for Independence and national hero.\n\nThe Underground Railway to Mexico is a network that helps thousands of slaves to escape into Mexico. Because of our constitution, every slave that sets foot in Mexican soil is considered free, and for many afro-american slaves in the American South, escaping to Mexico has been their salvation. Although there have been considerably more slaves crossing the Mason-Dixon line, some others even escaping into Canada, with the USA declaring the Fugitive Slave Act, it's clear that nowehere in the United States are slaves safe and sound. An approximate of 10,000 slaves have escaped into Mexico throughout this period, data is unclear as some of the convoys tend to be spotted and some don't even make it into Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207017;The Tordesillas Treaty had several modifications throughout history, we could decide on these two options, one claiming the entirety of the Amazons and one for claiming only the Western part of the Amazons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207019;Economic and territorial issues related to the land between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers along with the Dawson Massacre give us the perfect pretext for sending an expedition into northern Mexico to conquer the land we claim. However, this may not go too well and would risk war with the Mexicans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207020;Texas has launched an raid into the land it claims between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers in the North of our country dubbed the 'Mier Expedition'. They apparently justify the attack as revenge for the 'Dawson Massacre', although its primary purpose is clearly gaining control of the land they claim. The expedition is rather small and its members undisciplined, so it should be a matter of ease to send them scurrying back across the border. The question is whether we should follow them, escalating the raid into a full-scale war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With our holdings in Central America finally back into our control, we could even push a little further and conquer Panama, which was never formally under the Viceroyalty of New Spain, but shares cultural links with our Central American citizens. This will of course come with a heavy toll in our nation's image to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207021;Hundreds of Irish, German and American have been deserting from the American forces to join the Mexican army, this is due to the constant punishments to catholic soldiers in the American army which, by religious meanings, were considered closer to Rome than Washington and thus, closer to the Mexican cause as they shared the same religion. They formed an accountable battalion to serve our army under general John O' Riley and took the name of Saint Patrick for their battalion's name. They have raised their flag, with a green background, the golden harp and the words "Erin Go Bragh" ("Ireland for ever") on the other side, there is Saint Patrick with the words "San Patricio" alongside various other flags which include harps, Saint Patrick and clovers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bad_mexican_army;Negligent and Incompetent Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bad_mexican_army_desc;The Mexican Army is hardly an organization. It's a weak and divided force, and not everyone is committed to the army. The army has no motivation, no training, no practice.

EVTDESC4207025;In its recent decision to reform the constitution through a recent decree called the 'Leyes de Reforma', the federal government has decided on the official tolerance of protestantism while also prohibiting religious acts outside its temples. This reform has provoked a catholic uprising in Morelia, Zinacantepec, Hidalgo, León, Jonacatepec, Temascaltepec and Tejupilco. Thankfully, these revolts have failed to gather enough forces and can be suppressed quickly, but the populace is in turmoil, especially in conservative, catholic, rural communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
