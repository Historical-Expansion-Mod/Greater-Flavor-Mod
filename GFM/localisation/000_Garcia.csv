zollverein_desc;The Zollverein is a proposed organization of German States managing tariffs and economic policies in unison inspired by the creation of a variety of custom unions among some German states in 1818. The foundation of the Zollverein would be the first instance in history in which independent states form a full economic union without the simultaneous creation of a political federation or union. This could help our nation to assert our influence above the accepting German states and make the economy of the German people more dynamic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207015;\n\nThe Definitive Restoration Plan, a proposal by conservatives to restore the Mexican Empire, has been issued. It would create a constitutional monarchy following 4 important principles:\n1. The Mexican Nation is and will be independent, sovereign, and will for the third time take the heroic title of 'Imperio de Anáhuac'.\n2. The Empire's religion is and will be Apostolic and Roman Catholicism, without tolerance for other religions.\n3. Mexico's form of government will be a hereditary constitutional monarchy, conducive to the preservation of our culture and the fulfillment of the needs of our country.\n4. Agustín Jerónimo de Iturbide is proclaimed Emperor of Mexico. If he does not accept, the crown will be passed to Antonio de Hero y Tamaríz. In case he also refuses, the new emperor will be elected by our courts.\nWhat should we do?

Although there have been considerably more slaves crossing the Mason-Dixon line, some others even escaped into Canada. With the US having passed the Fugitive Slave Act, it's clear that fleeing slaves are not safe in the US. An approximate 10,000 slaves have crossed the border into Mexico throughout this period, though data is unclear as many of the convoys tend to be spotted and recaptured by slave patrols before making it into Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207041;\n\nSome among our cabinet have been discussing the possibility of sending an offer to the British regarding our border with their province of Manitoba. The plan is to offer them the lands we hold East of the Mississippi in what once was the American Minnesota in exchange for a small strip of land above the 49th parallel, which is part of the Mississippi River watershed and has a more defensible terrain. This could, of course, help us improve relations with the British, who would be getting more land out of the deal, if we can come to an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207042;\n\nThe Mexican Embassy has approached us to discuss the possibility of a land exchange in our Canadian border. Apparently, they are willing to give us their lands east of the Mississippi River Watershed in exchange for a small strip of land we hold above the 49th parallel.

EVTDESC4207043;\n\nAs a result of the recent election, General Trinidad Anastasio Bustamante y Oseguera has been elected to the presidency. His eight-year term will last from 1837 to 1845. One must keep in mind, however, that presidents of Mexico have the power to name a temporary interim president to take their role momentarily as a capable stand-in. This measure is in place in case they must leave Mexico City to lead an army against a rebellion. It would be quite optimistic to assume that General Bustamante will not have to deal with any such revolts in the years to come. Our former President, General Antonio López de Santa Anna, failed miserably when fighting the Texan rebellion and brought multiple shameful defeats upon our formerly proud army. As a result of his military ineptitude, he has been politically shunned and has gone into exile. Given his knack for returning to power, we will probably see him again given a few years' time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207044;\n\nIn the Sonoran town of Arizpe, José de Urrea, a renowned general who fought in the Zacatecas Rebellion, has proclaimed the re-establishment of the federal regime, and has overthrown the government of the Department of Sonora y Sinaloa. We have been alerted that he has started moving his troops down South to Mazatlán. De Urrea and other liberals flocking to join his rebellion reject the conservative central government established in 1835, the same sentiment that caused the revolts in Zacatecas and Texas. We must take action to squash federalism for good lest it returns to be a thorn in our side once more. §GIf you win as the revolt, you get reforms, and accept afro-latino, if you white peace as the revolt you get similar stuff but worse. Wipe out Mexico's armies and capture Mexico City to win!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207045;\n\nNews has reached us that general Paredes y Arrillaga has crushed the insurrection in a decisive battle in Mazatlán. The Federalist rebels are now defeated, and José de Urrea has been captured and imprisoned. However, his strategic skill could prove useful to the military, and it would be better for us to give him a second chance as an officer, especially since more Federalist revolts are brewing elsehwere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207046;\n\nAfter our success in overthrowing the unitarian government, federalism is now supreme throughout our nation. It is now time to enact a new constitution based on the Constitution of 1824 and bring peace and union back to our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207047;\n\nIn a surprising change of events, after a series of revolts in Guadalajara, Veracruz and Mexico City itself, the government of Anastasio Bustamante has once again been deposed by a combined force of General Antonio López de Santa Anna, Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga and General Gabriel Valencia (almost a repetition of Bustamante's deposal in 1832). They have declared the "Bases of Tacubaya", a reform to our current constitution. Additionally, they have condemned Bustamante's rule as authoritarian and have replaced his administration with a new cabinet and congress. Santa Anna has been made the provisional president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207049;\n\nFollowing the recent dissolution of congress, a new constituent assembly has convened in Mexico City, the Junta de Notables. This new overwhelmingly unitarian cabinet has enacted a new reform to the constitution, called the "Organic Bases". This has essentially strengthened unitarianism even more, and reduced the political rights of our citizens. Santa Anna is now what could be considered as a dictator, and we can only hope that this is the best choice for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207050;\n\nSince the reinstatement of the 1824 Constitution during the Mexican-American War which brought back federalism to unify our nation, the government under President Mariano Arista has become increasingly unpopular. The Catholic clergy, disempowered by reforms enacted decades ago, have have been plotting a coup d'etat for a while with the support of several influential officers, hoping to reinstate General Santa Anna to serve their interests. Now, they have finally made their move. Even Congress itself denied President Arista the extraordinary powers he asked for to prevent himself from being deposed. Antonio López de Santa Anna is in power once again. §RDon't be afraid, he won't last long in power.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYUTLAREVOLUTION;\n\nGeneral Antonio López de Santa Anna has become very deeply unpopular with the Mexican people and even his own general staff. Now, tensions have finally boiled over. The Plan of Ayutla has been pronounced by prominent generals and politicians Juan Álvarez, Tomás Moreno, and Nicolás Bravo, who have formed a rebellion to depose the tyrannical president. Without support and rebels closing in on all sides, his abdication has been achieved almost bloodlessly. Santa Anna is once again where he belongs: In exile. The liberals have formed a new government, but divisions between them and the conservatives still linger. With Santa Anna overthrown, we can finally reverse the decades of oppression and enshrine a new Mexican constitution granting liberties to all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207051;\n\nAfter having deposed Anastasio Bustamante and taken charge of the presidency, Antonio López de Santa Anna, a staunch unitarian, tried to convince the newly assembled senate to not revert Mexico to a federalist state. However, he failed in this undertaking, as the new senate is overwhelmingly liberal. Santa Anna then resigned and went to his hacienda to sulk, but ordered the new interim president, Nicolás Bravo, to dissolve congress and prevent a new federalist constitution. Nicolás Bravo, a unitarian, is against the prospect of Mexico returning to the federal system. On the other hand, he also detests Santa Anna. After much contemplation and hesitation, Bravo opted to follow Santa Anna's order and dissolved the congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANTAANNABIGWIN;\n\nAgainst all expectations, General Santa Anna has led Mexico to triumph. After routing the initial American invasion, he pursued the fleeing attackers and drove them back across the border. Following his initial success, Santa Anna executed a string of victories against the disorganized Americans, thus uniting the Mexican people behind him. Now that the Americans have finally sued for peace, he has returned to Mexico City as a revered hero, and his rivals have gone into hiding. Making use his enduring popularity, General Santa has awarded himself with the title of "Most Serene Highness" and announced that he will serve as president for life. For now, his position is secure, but it is likely that, as his popularity wanes and his cruelty comes to bear on the people, he will once again be deposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANTAANNABIGLOSS;\n\nThe American army under General Winfield Scott has soundly defeated General Santa Anna. After facing many humiliating retreats and even losing his prosthetic leg to the enemy at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, General Santa Anna is now widely despised and ridiculed. He has scuttled away into exile in Kingston, Jamaica, with his tail between his legs. Despite his long record of failures, betrayals and previous exiles, General Santa Anna still has some remaining allies in Mexico City. Though he is hated by the Mexican people, this bungling despot may yet return in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PLANLACIUDADELA;\n\nThe regime of President Mariano Paredes has fallen. Even before the invasion, the government was so unpopular that multiple states denied it taxes and conscripts to fight the widespread unrest. The Organic Bases of 1843, meant to strengthen unitarianism and empower the central authority in Mexico City only further eroded its support. General José Miguel Salas has put forth the Plan of la Ciudadela, which has two aims: Firstly, the return of the 1824 federalist constitution, ending unitarianism. Secondly, the return of General Santa Anna to lead Mexico to victory against the United States. With General Salas' almost effortless triumph over President Paredes, General Santa Anna has landed in Veracruz, returning from exile to lead Mexico once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANTAANNAFLEES;\n\nAfter toppling President Bustamante with the Bases of Tacubaya in 1841, General Santa Anna attempted to rule Mexico with an iron fist. Instituting the Organic Bases, a new constitution that gave the unitary government in Mexico City even more authority, he hoped to put an end to the unrest. It was, however, not to be: The new policies led to the exact opposite outcome. New revolts to restore federalism flared up in Yucatán and Tabasco, while many governors simply began refusing to contribute to the national army or send taxes they collected to the government. This has led to General Santa Anna becoming immensely unpopular and beleaguered on all sides. Seeing the writing on the wall, he has fled Mexico for Cuba. He did so just in time, it seems, as angry crowds have exumed his amputated leg and dragged it across the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rich in agricultural resources, the so-called "Great Desert" is becoming dotted with homesteads and boom towns. Even the Llano Estacado has been tamed as cattlehands push their herds into the wide open fields once under Comanche control. Meanwhile to the east, large crops of cotton are harvested alongside hay and grain. What were once small frontier posts are growing up to become large cities, and massive infrastructure projects are narrowing the gaps across the massive region.

EVTDESC4207056;\n\nAfter recent reports from General Manuel Mier y Terán, it has been decided that measures to encourage immigration to Texas and other areas must be ended. While the goal of this law is not to prevent immigration, it will cancel the benefits immigrants used to receive upon arrival in the desolate lands of the North to incentivize settling there. The reason for these measures is the protection of our sovereignty in the North. Regions like Texas have been increasingly dominated by anglophone American immigrants who agitate for unification with the United States. We can only hope that this will lead to America's influence in our northern territories declining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207057;\n\nAfter several past attempts to repatriate Emperor Napoleon I's mortal remains back to France, the new Président du Conseil Adolphe Thiers has pursued the return of the Emperor to France as a grand political coup de théâtre which would definitively achieve the rehabilitation of the Revolutionary and Imperial periods. Past attempts failed due to the active political turmoil of the time which would have inevitably created unrest among the population. Even in 1821 after Napoleon's death, the French King Louis XVIII refused because of these circumstances. But now almost 20 years later, it is a calm enough era in the French nation, and the debate about if Napoleon's body should be returned to France is still at bail. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207058;\n\nThe French ambassador has reached us to negotiate about the possible returnal of Napoleon I's remains to France from Saint Helena.

EVTDESC4207066;\n\nColombia's workers rights movement faces a devastating blow today as a massacre of protesting United Fruit Company employees came to light. After a strike in Ciénaga begun, in which workers demanded reforms such as ending hiring through sub-contractors and raising pay, the corporation's private army and the Colombian military fired on potentially thousands of workers. General Cortés Vargas is liable, per his own claim, for 47 workers' murders, though the exact number of casualties is unknown. Soldiers individually report having thrown the dead into the sea or buried them in mass graves. All this because of a collaboration between American business interests and the Colombian government to root out so-called "communist" elements. The massacre's scope has yet to, and potentially never will, be revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mex_fix_mines_desc;Back in the day, New Spain could flex on it's relatively strong and stable economy, which was mostly reliant on the mining sector. Novo-Hispano silver, gold and other valious minerals were exported all over the world. But during the long and bloody Mexican War of Independence, several of the most important mines in the entire territory got destroyed and flooded, severely handering our economic odds. To invest in the recovery of these mines would mean to let go of a significant part of our already tight budget, but it would certainly help us in the long run the earlier we do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207070;\n\nThe Americans, in their search for a connection with the Pacific Ocean, have approached us with an offer to purchase the territories north of the Rio Grande for a commensurate sum of money. The American diplomats are very enthusiastic about acquiring the land in a peaceful and diplomatic way. While the land they ask for is enormous, it is also sparsely populated and arid. Agreeing to this purchase could help us with our financial problems and improve our relations with the United States, but our people will despise this action. Additionally, bowing to the United States in such a manner would reduce our already scant prestige on the world stage. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
