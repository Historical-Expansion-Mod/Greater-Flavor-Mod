haitian_integration_title;Integrate Haiti;;;;;;;;;;;;;
haitian_integration_desc; While France has restored order to the rebellious colony of Haiti, resistance and tension has persisted in the colony. If we were invest heavily in Haiti, as well as extend equal rights to the Haitians and make Haiti a part of Metropolitan France, we may finally be able to calm the island's citizenry down and regain the loyalty of the Haitians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790001;Due to the Seven Years War, the Haitian Revolt, and the sale of Louisiana by Napoleon Bonaparte, France no longer possesses its lands in Hispaniola or New France. As the age of Imperialism begins and we look to expand our influence, the question is whether we should make a return to any of our former American colonies. Though reclaiming Haiti would be a bloody campaign, It is relatively defenseless and without allies. However, if we were to reclaim New France itself we will certainly risk war with The United Kingdom, and will be guaranteed war with the United States. While we may be able to regain some land through negotiations, much of these lands must be regained via war, something that will cause much internal unrest and international tension. If we are successful, restoring French America would be a major source of pride for both ourselves and our Empire, however the cost of war may be far more than the colonies are worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_paris_desc;§RGain 5 infamy§! Despite early British confidence, British forces were unable to make any gains against France. The British are willing to bring an end to the war by seceding Quebec and Acadia in its entirety, however in return we would recognize British control in the rest of North America.\n\n§RNOTE: This will only give you Quebec and Acadia but NOT all of Canada, this removes the ability to go for French Lousiana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_paris2_desc;§RGain 10 infamy§! Despite early British confidence, they have suffered a immense defeat at the hands of our armies, the French flag flies once again in Quebec and Acadia and British have agreed to secede the whole of British North America to our control. This is a glorious day for the French people! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790003;Now that we have restored French control over Canada, we must decide on what to do with the English Settlers. Few wish to accept out rule, any some have even begun to leave Canada to resettle elsewhere. We could mandate an expulsion program to evict the settlers, however it will be costly and will earn us the ire of the United Kingdom. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790004;The United Kingdom has denied our generous offer, making the peaceful acquisition of French Canada all but impossible, we could declare war on the British right now, or we could abandon the dream of reuniting the French Canadiens and avoid a costly war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790005;The United Kingdom has agreed to our demands, and they have offered to handover the French-speaking parts of Canada in return for a hefty sum of money. While perhaps more than what French Canada is worth, It is far lower than the cost of a drawn out war with the UK.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790006;Despite our best efforts, French armies once again occupy much of Spain. It seems there is little choice but to surrender to the French and allow them to dictate terms. If they are kind, they will simply force us to admit defeat, or possibly annex some of our colonial possessions. If they are unkind, they may force us to give up territory in our homeland -- though doing so will surely bring about the wrath of the European powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790007;The French Army has consolidated their control over Madrid and proven their superiority in the war, and thus the Spanish government has little choice but to accept any terms we dictate.

EVTNAME7790010;France's Natural Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT7790010;Vive la France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790010;The institution of a revolutionary regime in France in led most of the European monarchies to form coalitions against it. However, The military successes of the armies of the First Republic resulted in a considerable expansion of the national territory all the way to the left bank of the Rhine. While Napoleon Bonaparte would continue French conquests, His eventual defeat would lead France to be stripped of its new territory by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The prospect of reclaiming France's natural borders, however, remained popular to many people both within the government and France itself. Despite it's cost in French blood and iron, We have finally reclaimed France's Natural Borders. While German Nationalism and the rebellious Flemish and Dutch may upset the fragile peace, for now France has proven itself to be the True master of Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790011;In 1838 Jean François Langlois, commander of the whaling ship Cachalot, embarked on a grandiose scheme for a French colony at Akaroa. After a dubious land purchase from Maori he established the Nanto-Bordelaise Company in France to carry out the project, and in 1839, King Louis-Philippe agreed to provide assistance. The French representative for the settlement, Captain Charles François Lavaud, sailed for New Zealand in April 1840. A month later, the ship Comte de Paris set off for Akaroa carrying 53 emigrants. The French scheme sparked debate in England and France, and bowing to pressure to colonize the country, the British government sent out William Hobson in 1839. He signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, and claimed sovereignty over the South Island on 17 June.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790012;The French government has refused to recognize the Treaty of Waitangi. Rumors of planned French colonization attempts are spreading and our government is currently debating the best course of action to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790013;The United Kingdom has ignored our complaints, and maintain that the Treaty of Waitangi is valid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_new_york_desc;The Americans have been beaten. French troops control all key cities on the Eastern Seaboard as well as the American capital, giving the US no choice but to negotiate a treaty with us. We intend to demand the return of Colonial Louisiane, the cession of Maine down to the Kennebec River, and the revocation of any claim to said territories. For fair compensation, we promise the Americans a large sum of money as well as the Anglo-dominated portions of Upper Canada, as well as revoking any claim we have to the Ohio river valley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_louisiana_title;Reconquering the Louisiana Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_louisiana_desc;§RGain 25 infamy§! French Louisiana was an administrative district of New France. Under French control 1682 to 1762 and 1802 (nominally) to 1803, the area was named in honor of King Louis XIV, by French explorer Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. While France lost the territory during the Seven Years' War, France regained sovereignty of the western territory in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800. But strained by obligations in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte decided to sell the territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, ending France's presence in Louisiana.\n\nAttempting to reconquer the vast territory of Louisana will be a monumental task...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

integrate_guyana_desc;French Guiana has long been a colony of our nation, however debates over Guiana's future is splitting opinions within our government.

organize_acadia_title;Organize Acadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
organize_acadia_desc;Acadia was a colony of New France in northeastern North America that included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and Maine to the Kennebec River. Slowly annexed by the United Kingdom over the course of the 18th century, Acadia is once again in French hands. If we intend to keep Acadia this time, we must invest in the colony, funding new settlers, deportation of rebellious English colonials, and building infrastructure throughout the colony. If we are successful, we will have a far greater control over Canada and the North American coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
organize_canada_title;Restore French North America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
organize_canada_desc;§GMay lose 5 infamy§! Canada was the name of the French colony that once stretched along the St. Lawrence River, with the other colonies of New France being Acadia, Louisiana and the south shore of Newfoundland. Originally lost to the United Kingdom in 1763, we have now since restored out control over Canada. If we wish to counter possible rebellion by the Anglo-Canadians or invasion by the Americans, we must invest heavily in Canada, ensuring that the colony has a strong french presence and an unbroken loyalty to France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

organize_australia_title;The Settlement of Australie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
organize_australia_desc;Much like New Zealand, we have received Australia in our deal with the British. While a relatively minor colony, French colonial expeditions to Australia could be an important step in gaining a foothold in Southeast Asia and The Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_imperial_federation_title;The Status of Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_imperial_federation_desc; Ever since its liberation from the British, Canada has remained a quiet part of our Empire. It's low population, combined with the relatively isolated position has led to little change. As the British slowly partition their empire into dominions, the French-Canadian members of the national government have begun to question Canada's role in the French empire. Due to it's colonial status, two paths are open for Canada. Either we can create a French-Canadian dominion in the style of the British, or we could integrate Canada into metropolitan France itself. Similar successes in French Guiana has shown that distance is a non-issue. And as White, French speaking Catholics, Canada will be far easier to integrate compared to the Algerian departments. If we are to do this, we must act fast, and integrate Canada before any sort of French-Canadien nationalism can arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_imperial_federation_nzl_title;The Status of Nouvelle-Zelande;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_imperial_federation_nzl_desc;One of the most remote parts of our Empire, Nouvelle-Zelande (or New Zealand) fell under French control following a standoff between the UK and France in the 1840s. Since then, France has slowly settled the island, though its remoteness and low population mean that it has yet to develop a truly separate national identity. While granting more autonomy to New Zealand is always an option, we can also take advantage of this situation and integrate New Zealand into France itself, Similarly to nearby New Caledonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While granting more autonomy to Australia is always an option, we can also take advantage of this situation and integrate New Zealand into France itself, similarly to nearby New Caledonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_imperial_federation_louisiana_title;The Status of Louisiane;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_imperial_federation_louisiana_desc; Ever since its reconquest from the United States, Louisiane has been a relatively peaceful colony. But as France turns to focus on colonial exploits in Africa and Asia, the question arises on what to do with out colonies in North America. Louisiane was primarily settled in the 1840s by French settlers from France, and as such it still maintains strong ties to the Motherland. If we wish to avoid our empire fracturing like that of the Spanish or the English, we should take steps towards integrating Louisiane into Metropolitan France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_aosta_title;Claim The Aosta Valley;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_aosta_desc;§RGain 1 infamy§! The Aosta Valley was the first government authority to adopt Modern French as a working language, having done so in 1536--three years before France itself. French has been the official language of the Aosta Valley since 1561, and in the 1860s over 90% of the population declared being Francophone. In addition to our claims on Savoy and Nice, we will extend our claims to the Aosta Valley as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
integrating_french_algeria_title;Integrating French Algeria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
integrating_french_algeria_desc;§RGain 4 infamy§! Our attempts at settling Algeria peacefully with Frenchmen, therefore overwhelming the natives, have failed. If we are to make Algeria a core part of France, then much more drastic methods must be introduced. The reactionaries propose a harsh system of oppression, forced emigration, systematic relocations, and even execution by the military if the locals refuse to follow orders. At the same time, we will offer large incentives for French families to settle in Algeria. While the liberals in France will be shocked and appalled, this is a necessary action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_quebec_question_desc;Reclaiming Quebec and British controlled Acadia will be our first major goal of reuniting the overseas French. However, before we resort to all-out warfare to reclaim our former American colonies, we must try our hand at diplomacy first - if we offer a large sum of money, as well as agreeing to ignore British 'goals' elsewhere, we may be able to regain Quebec without a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
organize_new_zealand_title;The Settlement of Nouvelle-Zelande;;;;;;;;;;;;;
organize_new_zealand_desc;Now that the British have backed down, New Zealand is open to French Colonization. French Names are to be given to local areas, and the administration is to be re-organized, and the first group of government funded settlers will set up the colonial administration. While there have been concerns that the native Maori will be a problem, the Military has been dispatched to forcibly pacify the natives and enforce French rule over the Islands. A nation-wide propaganda campaign will be organized to attract settlers to the Islands, to avoid the low population problems that French Lousiana and New France suffered from, however the effectiveness of these policies will remain to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
walloon_autonomy_title;Grant Wallonia Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
walloon_autonomy_desc;Our recent annexation of Wallonia has not gone as smoothly as planned. Small cultural differences are present, and the Walloon-ran local government resists our attempts to centralize power. If we were to grant Wallonia a degree of autonomy (which may be revoked later), we will be able to quell any unrest and work towards fully adding Wallonia into the French Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

vichy_france_desc;While our invasion of France has been a success, the costs of occupation, in both manpower and resources, is unsustainable in the long run. If we want to continue our pacification of France, we should create a puppet state in the south as a legal continuation of the French Government, however under our strict jurisdiction. Northern France. and France's colonies, will remain German possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
establish_panfrenchism_title;Encourage French Pan-Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
establish_panfrenchism_desc;While France is certainly more united compared to its German or Italian neighbors, the fact remains that large amounts of French-cultured people reside outside of France's borders. The Swiss people in Romandie, The Walloons in the low countries, and even the French-Canadians in Quebec, are all French at heart. If we were to encourage French pan-nationalism, both here and abroad, we may be able to one day re-unite the French peoples of the world under a single French flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790100;With the Rhineland back under French control, The question has been raised as to what to do with the new "French" subjects. Despite the German nature of the West Bank, The Rhinelanders had not been enemies of Revolutionary France, unlike the Spaniards or Portuguese. Prussia, even after their incorporation of the Rhineland and Westphalia in 1815, were regarded by the Rhinelanders with more suspicion, due to their Francophile feeling. The incorporation of such a large number of non-French citizens has also brought up France's cultural diversity in other areas of the Empire, such as in Algeria or Flanders. Some of the more conservative politicians call for a purely French state, united in one language and culture. The Liberals, however, call for granting the Rhinelanders autonomy similar to that of the Walloons. While Autonomy will seriously hinder our assimilation efforts, it may reduce unrest in the Rhineland and prevent giving the Germans reason to intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7790101;French rule over the Rhineland has been firmly cemented in the last 15 years. The Rhenish autonomy laws, as well as the cultural exchange between the Rhineland and the rest of France, has finally earned the loyalty of the Rhenish people. As elements of French culture are merged with that of German culture, the Rhineland, while far more diverse than the rest of European France, is slowly but surely becoming an integral part of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
