jefferson_method_desc;The Jefferson Method is a highest averages method for allocating seats, and is thus a type of party-list proportional representation. Proportional representation systems aim to allocate seats to parties approximately in proportion to the number of votes received. For example, if a party wins one-third of the votes then it should gain about one-third of the seats. In general, exact proportionality is not possible because these divisions produce fractional numbers of seats. As a result, several methods have been devised which ensure that the parties' seat allocations, which are of course whole numbers, are as proportional as possible. In comparison with the Sainte-Lague method, §Ythe Jefferson Method slightly favors large parties and coalitions over scattered small parties§W.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

no_health_care_desc;The government doesn't care about healthcare and no funding for it exists. The few health institutions that exist are inherited from medieval times and are equipped accordingly. The medical career is an informal profession, mainly linked to the church. Hospitals use rudimentary lighting, facilities are overcrowded and infectious diseases round the halls and corners of the buildings. Prayers are commonly recommended to treat ailments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinket_health_care;Trinket Healthcare;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinket_health_care_desc;Doctors and nurses have a rudimentary understanding of wounds and diseases, partially relying on old beliefs when treating patients, but they do have formal training. Hospitals have rules to reduce overcrowding (beds are spaced a meter apart), provisions for ventilation, and the sewers leading from the hospital are flushed several times a day while the latrines/drains are disinfected with peat charcoal. There is meager collection of patient data but there aren't any proper sanitation standards for hospitals nor government agencies to check them. Healthcare facilities are hard to find.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your administration spending should be at least 20%.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_health_care;Low Healthcare;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_health_care_desc;Doctors and nurses are starting to understand wounds and diseases better during their studies and apply the principles of the so-called "germ theory" when treating patients. A Sanitary Commission was founded and its agents can be seen patrolling the hospitals, albeit infrequently, to guarantee a rudimentary sanitation standard. Healthcare facilities are starting to become common.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your administration spending should be at least 30%.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
acceptable_health_care;Acceptable Healthcare;;;;;;;;;;;;;
acceptable_health_care_desc;Medicine is a fully-fledged profession, with doctors and nurses graduating with complete understanding of the human body and a vast knowledge of diseases and how to treat them. Sterilization of the facilities and equipment is common, with Chamberland Filters used to filter water and the Chamberland Autoclave used for heating solutions above their boiling point to destroy dangerous microorganisms. Government agencies exist to enforce sanitation controls and ensure there's no overcrowding. Finding a clinic in an urban center is a relatively easy job and hospitals abandoned oil lamps in favor of gaslights that increase the efficiency of staff.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your administration spending should be at least 40%.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
good_health_care;Good Healthcare;;;;;;;;;;;;;
good_health_care_desc;The discovery of several vaccines revolutionized medicine, with vaccination being mandatory or strongly encouraged by the government. Doctors now use pharmaceuticals to treat patients and full sterilization of all medical equipment and facilities, quarantine procedures for infectious diseases and proper disposal of medical waste are mandatory practices enforced by the sanitation standards of the government agencies. Finding clinics or hospitals in smaller population centers is common, overcrowding is rare and some smaller health centers are starting to appear even in rural areas. Hospitals are equipped with modern electric lights and informational posters for staff.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your administration spending should be at least 50%.\nA fully funded administration provides a bonus to this reform.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

no_safety;No Safety Regulations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
no_safety_desc;Death or grievous injuries in the workplace isn't a rare occurrence as employers don't need to think about safety, only profit. The government has no governing legislation covering safety in the workplace and workers rarely manage to sue their employers over accidents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinket_safety;Minimal Safety Regulations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinket_safety_desc;Factories are required to provide proper ventilation and a regularly cleaned workspace. Workers can sue their employers in case of an accident but they rarely win any compensation. When they do the amount is usually negligible. Safety regulations only applies to factories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_safety;Limited Safety Regulations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_safety_desc;Safety regulations extend to the agricultural, civil construction and mining sectors. In mines, the use of safety lamps is mandatory. Employees suing their employers still have a hard time winning any significant compensation, but the government offers help to the affected families, albeit the amount given is barely enough to scrap an existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
acceptable_safety;Acceptable Safety Regulations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
acceptable_safety_desc;Safety regulations extend to all workplaces in our country. Government agencies label agricultural chemicals for toxicity and potential health impacts, mining and construction workers are required to use protection gear and hand brakes operated by workers riding on top of train cars were abolished. Employees have their rights guaranteed and getting compensation for accidents that happen due to employer negligence is a common occurrence. Government help to the victims is reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
good_safety;Good Safety Regulations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
good_safety_desc;Safety regulations extend to all workplaces in our country and cover potential psychological problems due to extended isolation and even minor injuries. Employers are obliged to supply workers with protection equipment and safety training. Warnings and reminders are spread through the workplace to guarantee workers remember their safety instructions. Getting compensation for employer negligence in the workplace is easy and the government supports victims with a good amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
no_work_hour_limit_desc;No limit on working hours per day. Workers have virtually no rights and employers do as they please with their workers. Conditions in some workplaces are analogue to slavery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fourteen_hours_desc;Working hours legislation aims to not only reduce the workload, but it also gives the right to a minimum number of holidays each year, restricts excessive night work and establishes the right to vacations, all this without a reduction of the workers' salaries.

At twelve hours per day, workers are starting to have time to spend with their families and are quickly becoming common visitors of taverns and cabarets after work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ten_hours_desc;Working hours legislation aims to not only reduce the workload, but it also gives the right to a minimum number of holidays each year, restricts excessive night work and establishes the right to vacations, all this without a reduction of the workers' salaries. While wages grow and working hours decline, the people have more time for leisure and for consuming, driving demand up. Weekends without work are a common occurrence and white-collar workers have a system of annual vacations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
eight_hours_desc;Working hours legislation aims to not only reduce the workload, but it also gives the right to a minimum number of holidays each year, restricts excessive night work and establishes the right to vacations, all this without a reduction of the workers' salaries. While wages grow and working hours decline, the people have more time for leisure and for consuming, driving demand up. At eight hours per day, almost all workers have the right to weekends off and annual vacations. Free time for leisure is at an all time high and the entertainment industry is in the middle of a boom. All over our country resorts emerge thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and we watch the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

aeroplane_factory_desc;Most aircraft in the era are constructed from wood, using metal sockets to joint members and making use of piano wire or stranded steel cable for bracing. Wooden construction typically involved several different types of timber, with careful use of different woods according to their mechanical properties and they were typically covered in a variety of fabrics including rubberized cotton and varnished silk. The first engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V8 engine, believed to be the very first V-form eight-cylinder internal combustion engine ever placed in production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
barrel_factory_desc;The tank is the 20th century realization of an ancient concept: that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower and it was born of the need to break the domination of trenches, barbed wire and machine guns over the battlefields. The internal combustion engine, armor plate, and the continuous track were key innovations leading to the invention of the modern tank. One of the earliest used designs was a rhomboid vehicle with a low center of gravity and long track length, able to negotiate broken ground and cross trenches while the main armament was carried in sponsons on the hull sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
automobile_factory_desc;Early automobiles, known as "Horseless Carriages", were simple vehicles with two or four stroke combustion engines capable of 2/3 horsepower (0.50 kW) at 250 rpm. Featuring an open crankcase and the use of a pushrod-operated poppet valve for exhaust, a large horizontal flywheel that stabilized the single-cylinder engine's power output and an evaporative carburettor controlled by a sleeve valve to regulate power and engine speed. They were produced in small workshops but evolved fast, with the simple open metal frame soon giving way to chassis with glass windows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
telephone_factory_desc;The earliest telephones had only one wire for both transmitting and receiving of audio, but the design was quickly replaced by the candlestick telephone. It featured a base with a vertical cylindrical neck extending upright for up to 10 inches in length. At the top of the stand was mounted a carbon microphone (transmitter) to speak into, and a switchhook extending sideways upon which an ear piece (receiver) was hung. In order to make or answer a telephone call, the user lifted the receiver off the switchhook, thereby activating an internal switch connecting the telephone to the telephone line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
electric_gear_factory_desc;The age of electricity began in 1882 when Thomas A. Edison introduced a system of electric lighting in New York City. Electric lighting quickly spread across the United States and was soon adopted in Europe. The electrical components industry was born, producing a variety of electric components for cars, telephones, gramophones and industrial machinery in general as the electrification in the industry advanced. Electric gear is needed for a variety of things, among them automobiles, telephones, radios and aeroplanes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
machine_parts_factory_desc;The Industrial Revolution received a further boost with the popularization of railways. For the machinery industry this brought all sorts of new work with new machinery for metallurgy, machine tools for metalworking and production of steam engines for trains. In addition, the emerging machine factories started making machines for production machines as textile machinery, compressors, agricultural machinery, and engines for ships. In time the market for the machine industry became wider, specialized products were manufactured for a greater national and often international market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fuel_refinery;Oil Refinery;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fuel_refinery_desc;An oil refinery is an industrial process plant where crude oil is processed and refined into more useful products such as petroleum naphtha, gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt base, heating oil, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas. In the Refinery, crude oil is separated into fractions by fractional distillation. The fractions at the top of the fractionating column have lower boiling points than the fractions at the bottom. The heavy bottom fractions are often cracked into lighter, more useful products. All of the fractions are processed further in other refining units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
radio_factory_desc;AM radio uses amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the transmitted signal is made proportional to the sound amplitude captured (transduced) by the microphone, while the transmitted frequency remains unchanged. It can be a TRF receiver or a superheterodyne receiver, the latter typically using 6 triodes: a mixer, local oscillator, two IF and two audio amplifier stages, with an IF of 45 kHz. The radio case could be made of Bakelite or wood and the insides typically were made out of a variety of metals and vacuum tubes, with the occasional rubber to isolate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
synthetic_oil_factory;Coal Liquefaction Plant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
synthetic_oil_factory_desc;The main methods of direct conversion of coal to liquids by hydrogenation process is the Bergius process. In this process, the coal is finely ground and dried in a stream of hot gas. The dry product is mixed with heavy oil recycled from the process and a catalyst is typically added to the mixture. Usually, iron sulphides present in the coal may have sufficient catalytic activity for the process. The mixture is then pumped into a reactor and the reaction occurs between 400 to 500 °C and 20 to 70 MPa hydrogen pressure. The reaction produces heavy oils, middle oils, gasoline, and gases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steamer_shipyard_desc;The key innovation that made steamers viable is the change from the paddle-wheel to the screw-propeller for propulsion. Steam engines are designed with the power delivered at the bottom of the machinery, to give direct drive to the propeller shaft, where it passes to the stern tube through the hull. Since the motive power of screw propulsion is delivered along the shaft, a thrust bearing is needed to transfer that load without excessive friction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
clipper_shipyard_desc;Clippers are fast vessels with three masts and a square rig. They are generally narrow for their length, can carry limited bulk freight and have a large total sail area. Optimized for speed, they are too fine-lined to carry much cargo. Clippers typically carry extra sails such as skysails and moonrakers on the masts and studdingsails on booms extending out from the hull or yards, which required extra hands to handle them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
luxury_clothes_factory_desc;Garment made of a single piece of the finest silk, its unique color acquired by repeated immersions in dyes whose shades were suggestive of moonlight or of the watery reflections of the Venetian lagoons, clothing embroiled with gold threads, handmade printed silk square scarves. The curvaceous S-Bend silhouette dominated fashion for women, the corset tightly laced at the waist which forced the hips back. Men wore tight-fitting, calf length frock coats and a waistcoat or vest. The vests were single - or double-breasted, with shawl or notched collars and accompanied by a crane or a hat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
luxury_furniture_factory_desc;Dark or gilded carved wood and richly patterned fabrics, intricate gold ornaments, cushions and fabric made out of silk, the finest or most exotic wood in the world used in furniture. Luxury furniture designers use and modify many styles taken from various time periods in history like Gothic, Tudor, Elizabethan, English Rococo, Neoclassical and others. The Gothic and Rococo revival style are the most common styles to be seen in furniture during this time in history. Styles are mixed with the introduction of middle east and Asian influences in furniture, fittings, and interior decoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steel_factory;Steel Mill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steel_factory_desc;Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, used in construction and other applications. When iron is smelted from its ore it contains more carbon than is desirable. To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added. Steel mills cast the raw iron into ingots which are stored until further refinement processes. The steel ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, blooms, or billets. Those are rolled into sheet metal, plates, bars, rods, wires and structural steel, such as I-beams and rails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
artillery_factory_desc;The first stage of artillery production is to create an exact model of the gun, mortar, or howitzer. This is built up upon a tapered wooden spindle, from eight to 12 feet in length and about two inches less than the model in diameter. The spindle is then set upon a wooden turning frame and covered with grease or soap to aid in its eventual removal from the mould. A coat of a lye mixture is spread over the interior surface to prevent the molten metal of the casting adhering to the walls of the mould. The mould is then taken to the casting pit to be annealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
small_arms_factory_desc;The basic equipment of the military, encompassing small arms such as muskets, rifled muskets, pistols, revolvers and rifles. Rifled muskets, the most common firearm in the mid 19th century was wrought in iron, forged as one piece, annealed, and machined to the configuration of a threaded plug extending from one leg of an L-shaped tang. It was carburized for wear resistance, and finished in wood in the stock and barrel bands. Some of them were rifled while old musket models weren't, and they typically came with a bayonet and a ramrod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
furniture_factory_desc;Well off pops live in very comfortable houses, although their servants lived in cramped quarters, often in the attic. During the 19th century, for the first time in history furniture was mass-produced. That meant it was cheaper but unfortunately standards of design fell. In the early 19th century skilled workers usually lived in 'through houses' i.e. ones that were not joined to the backs of other houses while the general populace often lived in 'back-to-backs'. These were houses of three (or sometimes only two) rooms, one of top of the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
paper_mill_desc;The paper mill uses a Fourdrinier machine to make paper from vegetable fibers such as wood pulp. The machine is composed of a conveyor belt woven from bronze in the forming section, where a slurry of fiber (usually wood or other vegetable fibers) is drained to create a continuous paper web. After the forming section the wet web passes through a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the drainage table, thus creating a continuous production of Paper. Paper is used for books, newspapers and other means of information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

regular_clothes_factory_desc;During the industrial revolution, fabric production was mechanized with machines powered by waterwheels and steam-engines. Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organization, with the sewing machine revolutionized clothes productions. The original machine was made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
explosives_factory_desc;The explosives factory manufacture a variety of components for industrial and military use like nitroglycerin, dynamite and black powder. In the early 19th century black power was the main fabricated component, used to mine for minerals, break rocks, clear fields and make roads. With the invention of dynamite, mines could be dug deeper and more quickly, and uneconomical deposits thus became profitable. Still, the main use of explosives was in the military industry: bombs, gunpowder, ordnances. For infantry, artillery or sappers, the use of explosives and gunpowder was central in the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ammunition_factory_desc;Swaging, rather than casting, was the preferred manufacturing technique during the 19th century for ammunition. Swaged bullets are bullets manufactured by swaging room temperature metals into a die to form it into the shape of a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Disadvantages became evident as loadings shifted to smokeless powder in the late 19th century and manufacturers of high-velocity military ammunition modified their bullet swaging process to apply a thin sheet of stronger metal over the soft lead bullet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
canned_food_factory_desc;The canning concept is based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers by the French inventor Nicholas Appert. The fabrication of most cans results in at least one "rim", a narrow ring whose outside diameter is slightly larger than that of the rest of the can. The flat surfaces of rimmed cans are recessed from the edge of any rim (toward the middle of the can) by about the width of the rim: the inside diameter of a rim, adjacent to this recessed surface, is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the rest of the can. Canned food is mainly used for military rations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dye_factory;Synthetic Dyeworks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dye_factory_desc;Natural dye is only present in small amounts and its extraction is often inefficient, so they are usually expensive. In an experiment with a compound called aniline, one of the simplest chemical components of coal tar, one inventor discovered that an alcohol extracted purple color, which readily dyed silk, and was much more stable in sunlight than any other purple dye in use. In the Synthetic Dyeworks dyes are mixed, synthesized in a reactor, filtered for impurities, dried out and then blended. Along the way many other additives, solvents and chemical compounds are used to instigate reactions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

winery_desc;The wine-making process involves the fermentation of fruit, with natural yeast or not, as well as blending. The malo-lactic conversion happens after, which is a bacterial process which converts "crisp, green apple" malic acid to "soft, creamy" lactic acid softening the taste of the wine. The wine is sometimes transferred to oak barrels to mature for a period of weeks or months. The wine must be settled or clarified and adjustments made prior to bottling. The process produces wastewater, pomace, and lees that require collection, treatment, and disposal or beneficial use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lumber_mill;Sawmill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lumber_mill_desc;At the sawmill, the logs are cut into boards using equipment such as circular saws and bandsaws. This is called conversion. The first stage of conversion is a process called breaking down, which means rough sawing. The second stage is called resawing and refers to more accurate / precise cutting and finishing, such as planing and further machining. The introduction of steam power in the 19th century created many new possibilities for mills, with steam powered sawmills being far more mechanized and scrap lumber from the mill providing a ready fuel source for firing the boiler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fabric_factory;Textile Mill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fabric_factory_desc;Fabric is a tightly woven textile made in a Textile Mill which is, among other things, used to produce sails for ships as well as clothing. With the Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton & Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanized textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth, diminishing costs and increasing profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cement_factory_desc;In 1824 Joseph Aspdin, a British bricklayer turned builder, patented a chemical process for making portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1,400°C (2,552°F), then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and gravel to produce concrete. Concrete is used to build factories, forts, shipyards, buildings, sewage systems and tunnels. Its use quickly became widespread in civil and military construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
glass_factory_desc;A new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832, this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The other glass-making method is glassblowing which produces bottles and other containers. Glass is used for a variety of appliances like bottles, windows, bowls, vases, lamps, jars, vacuum tubes and light bulbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fertilizer_factory_desc;In this factory fertilizer is created out of guano, sulphur or bone meal. The most common way to create fertilizer is the Birkeland-Eyde process. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate (NO3-) for the fertilizers. These fertilizers are used to increase the productivity of farms or the chemical components are further refined to make explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

early_electrical_telegraph_desc;The first commercial electrical telegraph was co-developed by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. This was a five-needle, six-wire system. The cables were originally installed underground in a steel conduit. However, the cables soon began to fail as a result of deteriorating insulation and were replaced with uninsulated wires on poles. As an interim measure, a two-needle system was used with three of the remaining working underground wires, which despite using only two needles had a greater number of codes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

eugen_von_bohm_bawerk_desc;Böhm-Bawerk's career as a scholar was an intermittent one. The most significant span of scholarly activity was his years at the University of Innsbruck (1881-1889). It was during the 1880s that he first published two of the three volumes of his magnum opus, Capital and Interest. His later years were dominated by his duties as the Austrian Minister of Finance, a position he held, though not continuously, throughout the 1890s and beyond-and for which he is fittingly honored by having his likeness on Austria's one-hundred schilling note. After serving in this capacity and assuming other governmental duties, he returned to teaching in 1904. With a chair at the University of Vienna, he became a colleague of Wieser, successor to the retired Menger. Students who passed through the university during the last decade of Böhm-Bawerk's career (and life: he died in 1914) included Joseph Schumpeter and Ludwig von Mises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
leon_walras;Léon Walras;;;;;;;;;;;;;
leon_walras_desc;The French economist Léon Walras (pronounced 'Valrasse') has been hailed by Joseph Schumpeter as 'the greatest of all economists'. Walras was one of the three leaders of the Marginalist Revolution, even though his greatest work, Elements of Pure Economics, was published in 1874, three years after those of William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger. Nonetheless, alone among the three revolutionaries, Léon Walras set forth the new 'marginalist' or 'Neoclassical' theory in a formal general equilibrium setting. Thus, he endowed it with the multi-market considerations Jevons had largely avoided and the mathematical precision Menger had eschewed. Léon Walras is widely and rightfully regarded as the father of general equilibrium theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

jean_jaures_desc;Jaurès was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1885. Defeated in the 1889 elections he returned to the University of Toulouse. He became increasingly radical in his political views and after reading Karl Marx he began advocating socialism. He was not a revolutionary and supported the Independent Socialists. While out of parliament Jaurès completed his mammoth Socialist History of the French Revolution. He also joined with Aristide Briand and Rene Viviani in 1904 to establish the left-wing newspaper, L'Humanité in 1904. A new Socialist Party under Jaurès grew rapidly at the beginning of the century but split over the correct response to German militarism. Jaurès advocated a policy of international arbitration whereas others supported the Triple Entente.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although educated at Götingen, he spent most of his life managing his rural estate, Tellow. In the first volume of his treatise, The Isolated State (1826), he laid down the first serious treatment of spatial economics, connecting with the theory of rent. His second volume (1850) developed the essence of the marginal productivity theory of distribution in a mathematically precise way, thereby making one of the most important Proto-Marginalists of the era. Nearing his death, he asked that his famous equation for the marginal product of labor, or natural wage, be carved into his tombstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME34608;Child Labor Law Passed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC34608;\n\nFollowing Britain's lead, in $YEAR$ Prussia, under the influence of some religious and social figures, passed a law strictly regulating the amount of child labor that was possible during the year. According to the new legislation, the Prussian government will lay down restrictions on child labor, with the following main points: children under the age of nine are banned from factory labor, children needed to have had at least three years of schooling before working, and children under the age of sixteen could work no more than ten hours per day. Other provisions included mandated rest times and a total ban on night work for children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
