DIM_cultuurstelsel_desc;Due to the war with Belgium, as well as the recent wars on Java and Sumatra, our treasury has run bone dry. To stave off financial disaster, we should try to increase our revenue from our colonies in the East. A new system called the Cultuurstelsel has been proposed, which will require farmers to grow cash crops for export.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_agrarische_wet_title;Institute the Agrarische Wet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_agrarische_wet_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! While vital for the financial well-being of our nation, the Cultuurstelsel has its opponents. Especially in liberal circles there is a lot of criticism of the system. They view the Cultuurstelsel as an inefficient and inflexible economic system, unable to respond adequately to changing circumstance.\n\nIn their view the East Indies would benefit from opening up to private capital. The treatment of the Inlanders is also a point of contention. They hold the Cultuurstelsel as deeply immoral, as it denies the locals education, Christianity and the blessings of progress. \n\nThe Agrarische Wet seeks to abolish the Cultuurstelsel and its governmental plantations, and open the East Indies up to private investment. Ownership of the land is returned to the Inlanders and western individuals can lease lands from them or the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_ethische_politiek_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! The Indies have always been a profit center to our nation. While great wealth has flowed to our great nation, the poor inlanders have seen little benefit from our rule. In fact, they have suffered dearly from abuse and exploitation under our rule. Some would say we have incurred a debt of honor towards the inlanders. They are proposing we follow a more Ethical Policy towards the inlanders. We would take ethical responsibility towards our inlander populace, and extend all benefits from being part of our great nation towards them. \n\nThe Ethische Politiek would be the official policy of colonial government of Indonesia in the beginning of the 20th Century. In 1901, the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina announced that the Netherlands accepted an ethical responsibility for the welfare of their colonial subjects. The Ethical Policy would promote efforts to improve the lot of the ordinary people through irrigation programs, the introduction of banking services for the native population, and subsidies for native industries and handicrafts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_event_title;The Cultuurstelsel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_event_desc;Replacing the old Landrente-tax, which required farmers to pay 2/5th of their harvest as tax, the Cultuurstelsel requires farmers to use 1/5th of their land to grow cash crops, mainly coffee, tea, sugar and indigo. Farmers who cannot grow these crops on their land are required to provide the Herendienst: 60 days of free labor per year to work on government plantations. Should the value of crops exceed the previously paid Landrente, the farmer is compensated accordingly by the Plantloon. To reduce the financial burden on the colonial administration, a system of local middleman, mainly Chinese, has been set up to handle the system. Furthermore, to tie local Heads to our administration, they are awarded a certain percentage of the crops called the Cultuurprocenten. To stimulate production, the Cultuurprocenten goes up the more is produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_cultuurstelsel_extended_desc;§RGain 3.5 infamy§! As the Cultuurstelsel is a very resource intensive method of running our colony, expanding it beyond our core territories on Java and Madura has not been proven feasible. However the Outer Islands, especially Sumatra, do seem to have the potential for the plantation system of the Cultuurstelsel. Expending there is certainly an option, if you are willing to bear the costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_landverhuurstelsel_title;Institute the Landverhuurstelsel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_landverhuurstelsel_desc;Now that the Dutch have established a full plantation system on Java, they are pressuring us to institute a plantation economy as well. More specifically, they are asking us to open up our lands to European exploitation.

DIM_regeringsregelement_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! The East Indies was been long ruled as a de facto absolute monarchy with the Governor-General as acting as a 'King.' This has long been a point of contention for liberals. \n\nThe Regeringsregelement aims to bring the government of the East Indies under parliamentary scrutiny. Furthermore it reforms and limits the spread of the Cultuurstelsel (to ease the suffering of the inlanders), puts a limit on the Herendienst, offers freedom of religion, settles issues of race and promises to end slavery in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_koelie_contracten_title;Koelie Contracten;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_koelie_contracten_desc;While the alluvial lowlands might provide some extremely fertile soil for our cash crops, they have never attracted a large population to settle there. Even today, the plentiful employment opportunities fail to attract sufficient laborers, hampering economic development in the region. Importing contract laborers, coolies, from Java, China and India might help alleviate the labor shortages, and strengthen our economic development there. Our colony in Guyana might also benefit from such an arrangement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_abandon_spices_title;End the Spice Monopoly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_abandon_spices_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! A remand of the VOC period, the islanders on the Moluccans are required to deliver a predefined amount of spices (nutmeg and cloves in particular) each year, and are not allowed to trade with outside powers. Like the Cultuurstelsel, the Liberals consider it a distortion of the free market and a form of colonial oppression. Abandoning it will satisfy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_abuse_title;Herendienst in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_abuse_desc;Under the Cultuurstelsel, farmers who cannot grow cash crops are required to provide 60 days of free labor to the colonial government. Originally intended to provide labour to government plantations, the system is now widely used for other purposes. As it happens the region around $PROVINCENAME$ has been suffering from a lack of investment, leaving the roads dilapidated, hampering local trade. Furthermore, the fortress at $PROVINCENAME$ has not seen any major work done in years. Lastly the local regent has complained his residence is no longer representative of a man of his position. We could divert the labours away from the plantations to remedy one of these issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_cultuurstelsel_famine_title;Famine in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_famine_desc;'To those who blame the Cultuurstelsel for the famine in $PROVINCENAME$ we say: When Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grain, it was due to famine. And yet history does not record the existence of a Cultuurstelsel in Israel. When the prophet Nathan threatened David with the disaster, he threatened him with famine, yet we do not read that the prophet threatened to inflict the Cultuurstelsel on David's kingdom. Europe too was ravished by famine before the potato, and British India still is. The famine strikes the Indies cannot be blamed on the Cultuurstelsel, which if applied wisely, spreads prosperity, not famine. We must blame the famine in $PROVINCENAME$ on local misrule. On local Heads who extract to much tax, and do not pay the dessa occupants their due Plantloon.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA211402;It is none of our concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_javanese_famine_title;The Great Javanese Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_javanese_famine_desc;While famines are not an unusual sight in that part of the world, the severity of the famine on Java has begun to be noticed. Questions have been raised whether or not perhaps the Cultuurstelsel lies at the heart of the problem. Our investigation has revealed multiple issues at play which may have contributed to the famine: While the official instruction is that leeway has to be given for the production of food, this is often ignored by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial officials. \n\nEnticed by the Cultuurprocenten, their share of the proceeds, local administrators and Heads often push farmers to work the plantations instead of their own rice paddies. Farmers are often required to use their most productive lands to grow cash crops, and lastly, it would that in some instances farmers are even forced to set aside more than the 1/5th of their land required under the Cultuurstelsel to cash crops. These factors, combined with natural forces are the likely causes the current famine in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli1_title;Overzealous Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli1_desc;One of our lower colonial officers - Eduard Douwes Dekker, an assistant-resident in West Java, has taken a very zealous approach to his job. Disturbed by the abuses of the Cultuurstelsel and Herendienst he found in his regency, he accused the local Head of severe abuse of power and bondage of his subjects. While his position of course requires him to reign in local excesses and protect the populace, his primary concern should be the protection of our interests! Currently, the authority of the Head is sacred and unquestionable to the populace. Bringing him to court might cause severe social upheaval. As such, the Resident has called the Assistent-Resident to order and stopped the prosecution of the Head. This did not deter the Assistent-Resident. The case has now reached the Governor-General who has to decided to continue the prosecution, and risk rebellion, or put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli2_title;Disgruntled Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli2_desc;A former colonial officer who left the service after an altercation with a local Regent, has now written a letter complaining about the treatment he has received. A fervent liberal and proponent of inlander rights, he claims to have written a book detailing abuses committed by both the colonial government and local Heads under the Cultuurstelsel. Having been reduced to poverty by his treatment, he is threatening to publish this book unless he is fully rehabilitated, which in this case means: a position of Regent on Java, full restoration of his pension, a large advance and, most preposterously, a decoration for his 'service.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA211404;We will not be blackmailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB211404;Perhaps it is best to hush things up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_max_havelaar_title;Multatuli;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_max_havelaar_desc;'I am broker in coffee, and live on the Lauriersgracht No. 37.'\nWith these words begins the novel Max Havelaar. It describes the consequences of the Cultuurstelsel in Java, in which government and local Heads cooperated to enrich themselves at the expense of the people. In the example of the body of a Javanese, murdered on the orders of the regent, floating down the river as a present from the sharks of the interior to the sharks in the sea, after that poor wretch had complained about the Regent, the 'humdrum' story of a buffalo of Saidjah's father, the village in Lampung set ablaze by Dutch forces. Cumulating in the majestic, almost terrifying, final chord in which Multatuli exposed Holland as a 'pirate state', and conjured the king not to tolerate any longer that more than 30 million Javanese are maltreated and exploited in his name in the 'glorious realm of Insulinde, that coiled round the Equator like a girdle of emerald.';;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_java_run_colony_title;Java, or How to Manage a Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_java_run_colony_desc;Long has our colony on Java been the envy of the world. The vast wealth provided by the Cultuurstelsel has propelled our nation forwards, and this has not gone unnoticed abroad. In a recently published book, called 'Java, or How to Manage a Colony,' the aptly named Englishman James Money described our colonial administration of Java, the Cultuurstelsel in particular, as the example of how a colony should be run. He writes that a similar system would solve many of the problems facing British India today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA211409;Good man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_belgium_java_run_colony_desc;In a recent book called 'Java, or How to Manage a Colony,' the aptly named Englishman John Money offers an insight into the Dutch colonial system on Java: the Cultuurstelsel. The plantations of coffee, sugar, tobacco and indigo have provided vast wealth to both the King and country. Virtually every venture the Dutch have undertaken over the past 30 years, from the canals and railroads of Holland, to the colonial wars in the east, has been paid for by the wealth extracted from Java. Despite relying heavily on forced labor, the author seems to be of the opinion that the natives do not mind as long as they are included in the march of civilization. Combining these factors, he is of the opinion that the Cultuurstelsel is the best way to run a colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA210449;Perhaps we should also get into this colonial game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_pangka_title;Colonial Contract up for Tender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_pangka_desc;Under the Cultuurstelsel private contracts are signed for the refining of the sugar. Now one of the most lucrative contracts on Java has expired and is up for tender again. We've been approached by close associates of us who ask to forgo the normal tender procedure, and award the contract directly to them. Such a arrangement will pose no legal hurdles. More worrisome, however, is that they have requested a governmental credit line to bridge the gap between the awarding of the contract and the actual operating of the refinery. Due to the distance between the Motherland and the Indies, such requests are not unreasonable. The more liberal elements of society might not take kindly to such governmental interference in the market though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_pangka_affair_title;The Pangka Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_pangka_affair_desc;Under the Cultuurstelsel private contracts are signed for the refining of the sugar. As these contracts are some of the most lucrative colonial contracts, there is always a lot of interest when they are up for tender. Shady dealings revolving around the awarding of the highly lucrative Pangka contract has now evolved into a public scandal. Under pressure from the monarchy, the contract was awarded without tender to a royal associate, and a governmental line of credit extended. The contracting party then promptly sold their contract for a sum vastly greater than they had originally paid for it, duping the treasury. Worse still is that, due to legal problems resulting from this, the refinery has not been able to operate for some time, leaving valuable loads of sugar unprocessed.\n\nParliament has long since been fed up with the corruption surrounding the awarding of the sugar contracts. The Pangka Affair has now given the Dutch Parliament the impetus to demand reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_regeringsregelement_zending_title;Missions in the East Indies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_regeringsregelement_zending_desc;There have been few limits imposed on Christian mission in the East Indies. In the past, this often lead to friction between the various denominations, especially when operating in the same region. The Christianization of the East has been hampered by this. The missions also have tendencies to chose more sensitive area's as basis of operation, greatly upsetting the local populace. The Regeringsregelement attempts to remedy these issues. Special permission has to be requested from the Governor-General before new missions can be started, and no two different missions may operate in the same region. The Regeringsregelement also allows for the Governor-General to declare some regions off-limits to missions, thus reducing unrest under the inlanders. The only question remains is which denomination we will favor. Will it be the Calvinists, our traditional religion, or shall we favor the Catholics, a historically repressed religion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_cultuurstelsel_escape_title;Emigration from $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_cultuurstelsel_escape_desc;One of the strengths of the Cultuurstelsel is its ability to be adapted to the local polity. By including the Heads in the system, by offering the Cultuurprocenten, their interests align with ours. Their influence and coordinating abilities are thus fully employed to make the Cultuurstelsel a success. This also means the system can, in broad lines, be applied to any region, with the local Heads adapting it to their specific circumstance. Some local variation in the system thus exists. The Cultuurstelsel in  $PROVINCENAME$ is a particular efficient variety. However the local populace disagrees, and has started leaving $PROVINCENAME$ looking for a more liberal implementation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_koelie_ordonnantie_title;The Koelie Ordonnantie;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They will often leave the plantations without permission for unspecified amounts of time, sometimes never to return.The planters are asking us to reform the judicial system, granting them extensive rights to discipline their laborers, and combat any perceived offence, in any way they deem fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This never set well with the liberal elements of society, and they have always pushed to end the governmental monopoly on sugar. \n\nA bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to this effect. Under the Suikerwet the government relinquishes its monopoly on sugar, and opens the sugar market to private capital, provided the sugar is refined in Dutch refineries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_koffiewet_desc;While in the days of the VOC spices such nutmeg and cloves might have been the economic motor of the Indies, since the late 18th century coffee has been the cork keeping our economy afloat. Therefore, when the Agrarische Wet was passed, the coffee cultures were specifically exempted. This never set right with the liberals and other proponents of a liberal economy.

DIM_end_hadj_tax_desc;The Hajj is the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. It is considered the religious duty of every able-bodied Muslim, who can afford to do so, to attend the Hajj at least once in his life. Every Hajji is treated with the uttermost respect and is granted the right to wear a turban and Arabic clothing. Such is the respect for the Hajji that other Muslims will gladly take over their Herendienst. Most Hajjis become spiritual leaders, and try to educate the populace. \n\nWherein exactly the problem lies. As the Padri Wars showed, Hajjis can come back with dangerous new ideas and cause severe social unrest. To limit the number of Hajji's a steep tax was introduced. So steep in fact, that only 70 new Hajjis registered last year. As the Regeringsregelement provides for freedom of religion, some hold the Hajj Tax to be in violation of that principle and argue it should be abolished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Alerted by the commotion caused by this, the Onrust was quickly swamped by prauws (piragua) who embarked hundreds of rebels on the ship. \n\nAll those aboard were slaughtered - even those who jumped overboard and fled into the jungle were hunted down and slaughtered.

Can we, after three centuries, with a clean conscience and our heads held high answer: We are worthy descendants of such heroes? Is it but lies and slander that we exploit the Javanese?\n\nIt has made our country the disgrace of the world. We have surrendered the honor of being a civilized nation: because even the Spanish did not treat our forefathers so unchristian.

Perhaps under our guidance can the Javanese can do away with their superstitions and join the ranks of civilized peoples. The society has started to raise money to fund Christian schools in the East.\nThe paternalistic nature of the society, however, has not fallen well with more liberal elements of our society. Multatuli, perhaps the foremost 'friend of the Javanese,' has published a damning commentary of their work: 'He who does indeed value Civilization does not ridicule her by spreading more or less illustrated school books, prints and atlases to those who he systematically exploits, abuses and murders.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Only those who can afford it, Europeans and Indo-Europeans alike, resort to sending their children to the motherland for an expensive private education. This is almost a legal requirement, as only those who have studied at the Royal Academy in Delft are eligible for official posts in the East. The protesters are demanding the revision of the educational system: the end of the 'Delft Monopoly,' the opening of more and better schools, and the end of the discrimination against Indo-Europeans. Furthermore they are demanding more personal and economic freedoms: freedom of the press, the end of the autocratic government, a liberalization of trade, the end of slavery, and the revision of the local currency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NEWS_batavian_revolution;Tensions erupt in the Dutch East-Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWS_batavian_revolution_short;As revolutions sweeps Europe, her colonies are not spared the upheaval. In the Dutch East Indies, police recently had to be sent in to disperse crowds protesting discrimination polices there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWS_batavian_revolution_medium;Long a loyal and willing outpost of the Dutch Empire, the atmosphere has recently turned sour in Batavia. Inspired by the events in Europe, liberals have gathered to demand an end to discriminatory practices from the Dutch government against her colonial citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWS_batavian_revolution_long;As revolutionary spirit grips Europe, it is important keep on reporting the news from the world around us. The Dutch East Indies, for example, would appear to be at the verge of revolution. Outraged by the lack of democracy and educational opportunities in the Dutch colony, a large group of prominent businessmen and other social elites recently gathered in anger Batavia. Such was the anger of those gathered that police forces had to be called in to contain it and disperse the crowds. The situation has quiet down since then, but a tense situation remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NET_buitenzorg_paleis_title;The Buitenzorg Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NET_buitenzorg_paleis_desc;The Buitenzorg Palace has served as main administrative center for the East Indies since the middle of the 18th century, but was destroyed by an earthquake in 1834. We have finally finished rebuilding the palace. The original palace had three floors, but, as future protection against earthquakes, the new palace only has one. Of particular importance is ''s Lands Plantentuin' (the botanical gardens) surrounding the palace. Originally founded as a forest for rare species of plants during the Sunda Kingdom, they currently serve a primary research institute for the development and cultivation of new species of plants. As such, it is one of the most important institutes of tropical research in the world, and of vital importance to the plantation economy on Java.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kina_aanplant_failed_title;Cinchona Tree crop fail;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kina_aanplant_failed_desc;The Cinchona plants we smuggled out of Peru have failed to take hold in the East. It might be because they did not survive the trip, the care they received was inadequate, they were planted in the wrong location, or the Indies may very well be unsuited for the growth of the plant. Either way, without this plant it will be impossible to establish our own malaria medicine industry, and we will be subject to the whims of other powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kina_aanplant_success_title;Cinchona Tree takes hold;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kina_aanplant_success_desc;The Cinchona plants smuggled from Peru have been successfully planted in the botanical garden at Buitenzorg. Of the 500 cuttings, only 75 survived the trip, but they have provided enough cuttings to establish a viable culture. The Netherlands now control a supply of malaria medicine..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kina_new_species_title;New Species of Cinchona;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kina_new_species_desc;A new species of Cinchona has been imported to the Indies. The bark of this species contains a significantly higher percentage of quinine (up to 10% of the bark, instead of 3%), the active ingredient in malaria medication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NEWS_cinchona;The Dutch Break Peruvian Medicine Monopoly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWS_cinchona_long;Peruvian governmental official reacted with surprise and outrage today, after the Dutch government announced yesterday that it had successfully imported the Cinchona tree into their colony in the East-Indies. Stocks of this tree, whose bark is vital for the production of malaria medicine, have long been by overexploitation overexploitation, causing anxiety worldwide due to possible supply shortages. The Dutch breaking the Peruvian monopoly on this tree is welcomed by many around the world, as it is hoped to lead to a more stable supply of this strategic good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWS_cinchona_medium;Tensions rise between the Dutch and Peruvian government after the Dutch government announced yesterday to have broken the Peruvian monopoly on Cinchona, a tree vital for the production of malaria medicine, and under severe treat of extinction under Peruvian overexploitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_pil_bandoeng_title;The Pill Bandoeng;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_pil_bandoeng_desc;Malaria is an ever present danger in the tropical regions of the world. There are few effective treatments for the disease, and those which do exist are expensive. Our control over the production of Quinine from the Cinchona tree has given our citizens abundant and relatively cheap access to the medicine. However, the inlander population has been unable to profit from this, and continues to be ravaged by the disease. A bill has been proposed in parliament to fund the construction of a large Quinine factory on Java. This factory will be specifically to supply the natives with this important medicine, and extend the benefits of Dutch civilization to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA211800;A worthy investment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB211800;The Indies only serve to profit us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_stovia_title;The School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_stovia_desc;We have always kept medical professions in the Indies a strictly western affair. There have been hospitals and doctors for inlanders, but never any inlander doctors and physicians. This has obviously had a negative effect on the access to modern medical care for inlanders. Most are now surrendered to the whims of the dukuns, and the magic and superstition they perpetrate. To combat this, and improve the plight of our colonial subjects, it has been suggested we start training inlanders in the medical profession.\n\nA second inlander medical, the Nederlandsch-Indische Artsen School or N.I.A.S., would later be founded in Soerabaja.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA211801;All right, but only train them for the more menial tasks;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_sell_NHM_title;Sell Stock in the Nederandsche Handel-Maatschappij;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_sell_NHM_desc;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (Netherlands Trading Society) was founded on the orders of king William I to 'stimulate trade, shipping, shipyards, fishing, construction and agriculture.' However it quickly grew as a major trading company, and, from the profits of the trade, into a major banking house. Through the king the state still holds a substantial share of the company. With the recent expansion of the company into the banking business, the value of the our share has sky rocketed. \n\nIf we are in desperate need of cash, we can sell our share of the company. However, it will result in less influence in the future of the company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kleine_compagnie_title;The 'Kleine Compagnie';;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_kleine_compagnie_desc;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, founded to reinvigorate Dutch trade, has had a major influence on the trade with the East Indies. Due to its effectiveness in trading the goods produced under the Cultuurstelsel, the company has managed to reinvigorate our economy, and our that of our colony. It is so effective that, in reverence of the older and greater Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, the inlanders have started refering to the company as the 'Kleine Compagnie' (the little company).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_tabacco_betuwe_title;Tobacco Cultivation in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_tabacco_betuwe_desc;Farmers in the countryside of Gelderland and southern Utrecht long have had a proud tradition of tobacco growing, dating back to the 1620s. The industry has declined somewhat from its height in the 18th century, yet remains an important economic sector to this day, even showing a sort of resurgence in the past few decades. \n\nHowever, the industry is threatened by imports from the colonies - not only do the rich alluvial plains of Sumatra provides better soil and climate conditions for the growth of tobacco, the labour situation gives the colonies a distinct advantage as well. The future of the tobacco cultivation will have be decided in the near future, and the issue has become a major electoral issue in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_raden_saleh_title;Raden Saleh;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NET_raden_saleh_desc;Raden Saleh, a painter of Javanese descent has made quite a name for himself in the courts of Europe. This 'Eastern Prince', a son of a noble family, has studied the modern European painting techniques under our patronage, and is possibly the first oriental to do so. He has shown particular aptitude towards painting portraits, and many a ruler has been immortalized by his work. His landscapes too are a sight to behold. Inspired by his native land, the paintings show exquisite detail in the wild animals he depicts. But perhaps his most important work is his depiction of the capture of Prince Diponegoro at the Java war, provocatively depicting a noble prince Diponegoro and slightly 'unbalanced' colonial officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_flood_1855_title;The Flood of 1855;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1855_desc;The dikes along the Rhine river have given way to the water! The severe winter hitting the country has caused an ice dam to form on the river, trapping the water behind it. When the dam finally gave way to the mass of water, it took a substantial part of the dike flanking the river with it. The water has now flooded into the valley along the river, destroying many homes and farms in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1861_1_title;The Flooding of the Bommelerwaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1861_1_desc;The dikes along the Waal river have given way to the water! Heavy ice had gathered on the river, and an ice dam was spotted forming in a narrowing of the river near the village of Vuren. Despite the best efforts of the local resides, it had proven impossible to remove the ice dam. With the ice dam not budging, it was only a matter of time before the dikes would be breached. Luckily, no-one was killed, but the material damage is substantial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1861_2_title;The Flooding of the land of Maas and Waal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1861_2_desc;Due to ice blocking the flow of the river, the Waal river breached the dikes protecting the 'Land of Maas and Waal.' Such is the flow of water into the region, that it has started spilling over the dikes into the Meuse river on the other side. Many people had sought refuge on the fateful dike and were swept away by the water. We have to fear for their lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1877_title;The Storm Surge of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1877_desc;A great storm has raged over the North Sea. It, combine with springtide, has pushed the water the over North Sea over the dikes protecting the northern regions of our country. Especially hard hit is the Westpolder, an area of land reclaimed from the sea only last year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1906_title;The Great Storm Surge of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1906_desc;Hurricane force winds have pushed the water on the Scheldt river up to 7.5 meters above its normal level. Far greater than the dikes were ever designed to carry. Especially the region around Antwerp has been hit hard. Vast swaths of land have been flooded, and, due to the tidal nature of the Scheldt, reparations have proven difficult. As with each new tide new water flows through the breaches in the dikes. Until the dikes are repaired it will be impossible to pump all the water out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1916_title;The Storm Surge of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1916_desc;A storm tide and high river run-off have conspired together to flood the countryside. Great swaths of land around the Zuiderzee have flooded as a result of dikes breaching under the heavy load of water they were exposed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1926_title;The Flooding of the Meuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_flood_1926_desc;Due the size of the snow fall in Europe last winter, and the fact that it has started melting, had pushed the water level of the Meuse river to historical levels. While critical, the dikes held. However, the run-off of the recent abundant rains have proven to much for the dikes, and water has now started flowing into the southern regions of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_NET_dagbladzegel_title;The Dagbladzegel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NET_dagbladzegel_desc;Some say the Dagbladzegel (The Newspaper Tax) has had its day, and voices are being raised to abolish it. The tax was originally introduced by Emperor Napoleon, and it has proven a useful tool to control public opinion. The steepness of the tax (up to half of the price of the newspaper) has ensured that only the wealthy read the papers, and no new radical papers would be founded.\n\nA new bill has been brought to parliament to abolish the tax. What course of action shall be taken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA211600;The 'Dagbladzegel' is abolished;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DIM_NHM_collapse_title;Collapse of the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NHM_collapse_desc;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij has become as long way from a rather simple majority government owned trading company to the banking juggernaut it has become today. Run from their office in Amsterdam, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij runs a financial empire unrivalled in the world. Unfortunately this has brought a sense of immortality and arrogance with it. Due to this the company has become over-invested in some markets and projects, which left it without a sufficient cash flow to cover its debt. While under normal circumstance this would be covered by the equity, the recent stock market crash has wiped away all equity of the company. Unable to cover its debts the company is now at the verge of bankruptcy and is threatening to take the whole country with it. An emergency session of cabinet has been convened, and the country eagerly awaits its decision regarding this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NHM_banking_title;Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij Banking;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NHM_banking_desc;With the current economic situation, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij has made an interest to becoming a banking company instead of just a trading company. The company assures us this would be profitable, but due to the government's majority shares in the company, we can stop this if we so choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DIM_NHM_banking2_desc;Again, the Nederlansche Handel-Maatschappij has a proposal to expand further into banking. So far, this has not caused many issues, but if a significant economic crash were to happen, the whole company could be at risk. What should our response be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
