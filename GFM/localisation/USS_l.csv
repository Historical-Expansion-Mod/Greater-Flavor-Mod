USS_form_UCA_title;Unite Central America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_form_UCA_desc;With South America unified under our leadership, it is our duty to continue strengthening the people of Latin America through solidarity. Nowhere is the chaos of the New World more noticeable then Central America where petty states are kept in divided squalor for the benefit of American and European capitalist. Even we can teach them the merits of unity, surely, they will prosper under our supervision and protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_annex_CUB_title;Integrate Cuba;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_annex_CUB_desc;During the Latin American Wars of Independence, Cuba and other Caribbean islands remained other Spanish subjugation. However, a new sun rises over the Caribbean and with Cuba under our protection, we can begin to integrate them into our union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_annex_DOM_title;Integrate the Dominican Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_annex_DOM_desc;During the Latin American Wars of Independence, the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean islands remained other Spanish subjugation.

USS_puppet_MEX_title;Strengthen Control Over Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_puppet_MEX_desc;Although separated by vast distances, Mexico and South America are connected by our struggle for independence against imperialist aggressors. However, the years have not been kind to Mexico and the nation frequently faces the threat of invasion and revolt. For Mexico to be truly safe, we must strengthen our control of its affairs. However, we have no guarantees that Mexico will accept such a paternal relationship and the United States will see this an encroachment upon their backyard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_afro_title;Embrace Afro-Latin Americans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_afro_desc;With the intermixing of ethnicities, a common occurrence in South America and other Latin American states, an individual's true ethnicity is a blurred line. Nevertheless, in several parts of South America, the shackles of slavery have only recently been broken. We should begin integrating the former slave population to erase the stain left by Spanish and Portuguese slavers. Obviously not everyone will be pleased by this decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_UCA_dismantle_title;Dismantle Central America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USA_UCA_dismantle_desc;Now that the South Americans have been beaten back and Central America is under our control, we can restore the status quo to the region. This unholy union will be no more, and American entrepreneurs will be able to operate freely. Order is restored and our interest our secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC6018206;When South America unified, many in the United States showered it with praises and the Monroe Doctrine was declared a resounding success. Politicians in Washington claimed it was a sister nation to the United States. However, the recent involvement of South America in Central America has shifted opinions. Several American companies have been expelled from the region, and many plantations have been seized by the new government. Our nation’s capitalist our outraged and are demanding an immediate invasion to restore the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5730318;The South Americans are wanting to strengthen control over our foreign policy and other stately duties, basically reducing to a puppet. They claim it is for our own protection, but it is a blatant violation of our sovereignty. Should we refuse, the South Americans will almost certainly invade us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4115722;Seeing the benefits of solidarity with their southern brethren, the Mexicans have submitted to our demands and our now firmly under our control. While we can celebrate for now, South America must prepare itself to a possible conflict with the United States. Our actions in Mexico have angered many in the country, and although Washington has yet to issue a statement, we can predict it will most likely be one of condemnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9496491;Mexico has refused to submit to our protection citing sovereignty over solidarity. Truly they are traitors to the cause of anti-imperialism. This is obviously the work of foreign agents in their government and the only reasonable course of action is a swift invasion straight towards Mexico City to oust the tyrants. The corrupt politicians will most likely run to their masters in the United States for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8787882;The South Americans have installed a puppet government in Mexico, an extreme violation of our southern neighbor’s sovereignty. With South Americans encroaching straight into our backyard, many in the states fear America’s interest our severely threatened. Hardliners across nation are advocating for a swift response and the sending of troops across the border into Mexico to oust the South Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2187159;With the South Americans threatening our independence, it might be necessary to ask the United States for protection. While some see this a trading one tyrant for other, the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t know. The Americans will most likely agree as South America has continually been threatening their hegemony in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3403075;Relations between the United States and South America continue to sour. When the South Americans strengthened control over Central America, capitalist across the nation were outraged when their companies were expelled from the region. Mexico seems to be next on South America’s list and politicians in Mexico City have petitioned us for assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8430867;Order has been restored to Mexico and the country is now warmly our embrace. No longer will Mexico be threatened by outside forces. Unlike their Aztec predecessors, the Mexican people will not fall to ruin, but rather they will prosper under South American guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3591929;At the turn of the 19th century, Simon Bolivar dreamed of a united Latin America that could defend itself against invasion and exploitation by the United States, European powers, or any force that would threaten the freedom of South America. Now, after a constant struggle from enemies both foreign and national, South America stands triumphant. The master of its own destiny and guardian of other Latin American people. The future looks bright for the New World in this new age of fraternity and liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8773762;Due to the size and power of Brazil, it was no surprise to many that it would unite the nations of South America under one flag. The Brazilian people have guided the continent to a new age of prosperity and liberty. With that being said, the majority of Spanish speaking population have always been uncomfortable hearing laws passed in the Portuguese tongue. The recent downturn in luck for our country has only exacerbated the issue. In Cusco, a congress of Spanish speaking delegates has gathered to demand greater autonomy. If we give in to such demands, our state will be weakened even further, yet to refuse would guarantee a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1804935;Under the agreements reached by the Cusco Congress, the Brazilians must turn over land that is rightfully ours. We should remind them of their obligations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6595090;After the Cusco Congress, autonomy for the Spanish speaking regions of South America was guaranteed. We must honor our promises to the Spaniards and return any cores that belong to them. If this is what it takes to guarantee peace, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1900885;A united South America without the Brazilians would be unthinkable. As the largest country on the continent, they play a vital role in the preservation and prosperity of South America. Nevertheless, the Brazilians are as unique as they are important. As the only Portuguese speaking people in South America, there exist a divide between them and the rest of the union. The recent downturn in luck for our country has only exacerbated the issue. In Rio de Janeiro, a congress of Brazilian delegates has gathered in what is being called the Brazilian Banquet to demand greater autonomy. If we give in to such demands, our state will be weakened even further, yet to refuse would guarantee a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8485586;Under the agreements reached by the Brazilian Banquet, the Brazilians must turn over land that is rightfully ours. We should remind them of their obligations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2101676;After the so called Brazilian Banquet, autonomy for the Spanish speaking regions of South America was guaranteed. We must honor our promises to the Spaniards and return any cores that belong to them. If this is what it takes to guarantee peace, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_miranda_title;Declare the Miranda Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_miranda_desc;In the early nineteenth century, Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda attempted to liberate all of Spanish America and unite it under one glorious flag. Sadly, he failed and died in a Spanish prison, but now we have the opportunity to revive his dream and expel the last of the imperialist from Latin America. Officials are gathering in the South American capital to declare a doctrine that will accomplish what the American Monroe Doctrine never could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_USA_win_title;The Second Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_USA_win_desc;After a terrible struggle, victory belongs to South America and our hegemony over the New World is unquestionable. The people of Latin America will no longer be oppressed by the United States. Land stolen during the American Intervention in Mexico will be returned, and the United States will be dismantled into smaller and easier to manage federations. The future of the Americas shines bright under the Sun of May.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_USA_lose_title;The Treaty of Miami;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_USA_lose_desc;The South American invaders have been repealed, and parades march down every boulevard in celebration in our defense of freedom. For too long the United States has allowed South America aggressive expansion to continue uncontrolled for too long, but after this war it has become clear a united South America must come to an end. Delegates are meeting in Miami to determine what is to be done to restore order to the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_colonies_title;Secure Uncolonized Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_colonies_desc;With South America unified under one flag, we are strong enough to secure the uncolonized land on our southern border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_caliport_title;The Port of San Francisco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_caliport_desc;In order to secure South American security interest in North America, we should approach Mexico to purchase the Port of San Francisco. A naval base there will help us keep an eye on the the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8165067;It would seem the New World is not large enough for two hegemons. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared a war of extermination upon $COUNTRY$ and has made clear its intentions to dismantle the United States. Not since our nations founding, have the principles laid out by our Founding Fathers in the Constitution been more threatened. All God-fearing men of the republic must answer Lady Liberty’s call to arm or else she and her values will perish along with this Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3755286;The great war between the Americas is over, and $COUNTRY$ has suffered a great and humiliating defeat at the hands of the South Americans. All lands taken by the United States during the Mexican-American war are to be surrendered to back to Mexico, and several states are being organized into independent republics. It is unlikely the United States will ever recover from this defeat. One thing that is certain is the New World belongs to the South Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5084910;The recent defeat of the United States at the hands of the South Americans has resulted in the complete and utter shattering of the Union. Land taken by the United States is being returned to us under the newly drafted peace treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4102182;Any question regarding the supremacy of South America has been answered by the thunderous sounds of South American boots marching through the Yankee capital. The great war is won, and the United States is over. Their reign of terror in the Caribbean and the Americas has finally come to an end. Latin America is in control of its own destiny, and the imperialist of the world quake in fear as the sons and daughters of Simon Bolivar stand strong in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1033676;It is obvious to everyone that the United States is a shadow of its former greatness. The states that remain believe the old ideals of Founding Fathers should be abandoned in favor of something new and more appropriate to our current state of affairs. Some say the Great Lakes and Chicago are the new heart of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8075754;South America exploded in power so quickly and with such great force that it is not surprising that the Union should collapse just as swiftly. Many in South America were sure that they could overthrow the United States hegemony over New World, but the Eagles wings are not clipped so easily. Now that victory belongs to the United States, the continent of South America will be returned to its state of scattered, disunited, and bickering countries all under the sphere their Yankee overlords. The greatest experiment in South America is now over, and the ghost of revolutionaries’ weep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5596858;South America has been beaten back by the United States, and as such the Treaty of Miami has dictated land be returned. The New World is to be returned to its status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6261783;Order has been restored to South America, and the ideals of $COUNTRY$ have been preserved for another generation. The tyrannical grip that existed over South America has been broken, and independence and liberty has returned to the continent. The nations of the New World will no longer have to live in fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_dismantle_USA_title;The Final War for Liberation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
USS_dismantle_USA_desc;If the people of Latin America are to be truly free, then the we must end the United States of America’s domination of the New World. While it claims to be the protector of democracy against foreign threats, the United States is nothing more than another imperial tyrant. All of Latin America must rally behind $COUNTRY$ in this final war for liberty! Although should we be defeated, the consequences will be grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
