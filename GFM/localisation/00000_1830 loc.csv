schomburgk_line_title;The Schomburgk Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgk_line_desc;Following the dissolution of Gran Colombia, its unsettled and remote eastern frontier in Essequibo has been left unorganized and unprotected. Following our acquisition of Guyana from the Dutch, we inherited a territorial dispute over Essequibo with Gran Colombia which disputed the former Spanish treaty. Thus we have legal justification to seize this patch of jungle without conflict. The Royal Geographical Society of London recommends we send Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk to explore the region and delineate a proper border with Venezuela, as his work on surveying the Virgin Island of Anegada was quite impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgkexplained;Abusing flimsy claims of inheritance of responsibilities from treaties between the Spanish and the Dutch, Britain has occupied Essequibo. With our recently nascent country barely posessing an army of note, there is nothing we can do to resist the Brits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORDEATH;After resigning from the presidency, Bolívar made his way to Cartagena de Indias to board a ship and settle down abroad. However, he rested in the Customs House of Santa Marta as his health made travel difficult. As his condition worsened, he needed a transfer to a quieter place and moved to a farm located in San Pedro Alejandrino on the outskirts of the city, where he entered the full care of his trusted family doctor. Initially optimistic, both he and his doctor eventually recognized the severity of the condition, leading to Bolívar writing his will and instructing his entourage how to proceed in the event of his death. \nAfter the passage of morning marked by an increasing decline of vital signs, the silence of the house's main hall, occupied by the aides, military leadership of the Patriot Army and Bolívar's closest friends, was interrupted by the words of his doctor inviting them to the next room to witness the great liberator's last moments. Surrounded by his entourage, and after a long but calm agony, Simón Bolívar died at 1 PM, 3 minutes and 55 seconds on Friday, December 17, 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORSLASTWORDS;'Colombians: You have witnessed my efforts to raise freedom where tyranny once reigned. I have worked with selflessness, abandoning my fortune and even my tranquility. I separated from command when I was persuaded that you distrusted my detachment. My enemies abused your credulity and they trampled on what is most sacred to me, my reputation and my love of freedom. I have been a victim of my persecutors, who have led me to the doors of the tomb. I forgive them. As I disappear from your midst, my affection tells me that I must make a manifestato of my last wishes. I do not aspire to any other glory than the consolidation of Colombia. All of you must work for the inestimable good of the Union: The people obeying the government to be free from anarchy, the ministers of the sanctuary directing their prayers to heaven, and the military using their sword to preserve the peace. Colombians! My last wishes are for the happiness of the country. If my death contributes to the end of the parties and the consolidation of the Union, I shall go to the grave in peace.'  -Simón Bolívar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_title;The Apulo Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_desc;Gran Colombia is doomed. Without Bolívar, no leadership can emerge with enough legitimacy in the people's eyes to keep the country unified. With Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama in revolt, perhaps it is time to accept the inevitability of partition rather than spill more of our countrymen's blood. Accordingly, President Rafael Urdaneta has called for a convention to officially dissolve the union of Colombia and create a new state within the territories still under stable federal control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORRESIGNS;Since 1828, Simón Bolívar has attempted to deal with Gran Colombia's national crises and keep the country united by assuming dictatorial powers. At present, however, has finally seen that this course of action has not kept the union together, but divided it ever more severely. He has now arrived at the conclusion that it would be best for Gran Colombia if he, El Libertador, resigned and left the presidency to an heir more capable of resolving national division. This course of action, however, risks creating ever more uncertainty. Gran Colombia was founded with Bolívar at the helm--his name is a byword for the country writ large, and his rule has been integral to Colombia's national identiy. What will happen to the nation after his resignation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES;Led by the traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence following the example of Venezuela and Ecuador. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived unlike those in Venezuela and Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSECEDES;Informed of the secession of Venezuela and Bolívar's death, the assembly of the district of the South has declared independence, founding the state of Ecuador. The departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are now under the supreme rule of Juan Jose Flores, the head of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASECEDES;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of hero of the wars against Spain, General José Antonio Páez who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata that occurred between 1826 and 1829. While the assembly's rhetoric was anti-Bolivarian from the start, once it had been informed of Bolívar's death, it took a turn for a worse. The assembly ultimately ceremoniously announced its independence from Gran Colombia as the state of Venezuela under the leadership of General Páez himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAQUESTION;General Tomás Herrera has lead a counterrevolt against Juan Eligio Alzuru to put an end to Panamanian independence and repatriate to Colombia. While his revolt is seeing a lot of success, he needs the support of the people. The question lies in their loyalty to Colombia. Will they work towards continued self-sovereignty or reintegration to Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS;Executed by General Tomás Hererra, Alzuru's revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope the same may occur in Venezuela or Ecuador, but those hopes are clearly in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It establishes the separation of powers, the responsibilities of public officials, the duty to protect the Catholic church and the unitary form of government with decentralized local assemblies. Furthermore, it divides congress into an upper and lower house and sets its legislative terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADMIRABLECONGRESS;Simón Bolívar's years as dictator of Gran Colombia have done the union no good. His unquestioned reign has even been compared by many to that of the kings of Spain. Recognizing what is best for the union, he has called for a new constitutional assembly to create a constitution for Gran Colombia in a last-ditch effort to prevent its dissolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE;After much trial and tribulation, Gran Colombia is united once more. El Libertador can rest easy knowing that the Bolivarian legacy shall continue. However, now that the crisis of secession is averted, we must ask ourselves what lies in our future. How will we govern ourselves to ensure that Gran Colombia will survive and not collapse once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERTHYRRISING;Some days ago riots started in the town of Merthyr Tydfil, north of Cardiff, and today there are already reports of it expanding into all Wales, being an all-out rebellion. It's the first time a red flag is seen in a workers' revolt, being a symbol of the workers. They protest against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment, and among the shouts were cries of "Caws a bara" (cheese and bread), "Annibyniaeth" (independence) and "I lawr gyda'r Brenin" (down with the king), being a clear threat to the monarchy. Do we give them more rights or we protect the monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWYORKSECONDFIRE;On a night in 1835, a fire broke out in a five-story warehouse at 25 Merchant Street, at the intersection of Hanover Street. As it spread, gale-force winds blowing from the northwest towards the East River spread the fire. It could be seen from Philadelphia, approximately 80 miles away. At the time of the fire, major water sources were frozen in temperatures as low as -17°F, forcing the firefighters to drill holes to access liquid water, which later refroze around the houses and pipes. Efforts were made to deprive the fire of fuel by demolishing surrounding buildings, but there was insufficient gunpowder. Later in the next evening, a detachment of U.S. Marines returned with gunpowder and stopped the fire. During the day and a half that it burned, the fire killed 2 civilians and in total destroyed 660 buildings, resulting in property damage estimated between 20-25 million.

With the rebellion spreading like wildfire among the Poles, the peoples of Lithuania, Belarus, and the right-bank Ukraine have also been whipped up, threatening further revolutions.

EVTDESC127854;3 days ago Nat Turner, an enslaved African-American preacher, had organized a rebellion of enslaved and free Black people in Southampton County, Virginia. Turner was recorded as "Nat" by Benjamin Turner, the man who enslaved him and his family. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, under then-current laws which made slavery legal, Nat was inherited as property by Benjamin's son Samuel Turner. On February 12, 1831, he witnessed a solar eclipse that was visible from much of the southeastern United States, and was convinced that it was the sign for which he was waiting. He began preparations for an uprising against the enslavers in Southampton County by purchasing muskets. The last 3 days they have been waging terror in Southampton, but have been stopped today by local militias and detachments of men from the USS Natchez and USS Warren. Approximately 120 black people and around 60 white people died today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC127855;Turner eluded capture for six weeks, but remained in Southampton County. On October 30, a White farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people, in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. While awaiting trial, Turner confessed his knowledge of the rebellion to attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray, who compiled what he claimed was Turner's confession. Today he got sentenced to death and hanged for "conspiring to rebel and making insurrection".;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They also call for a new constitution to overhaul the governance of all Switzerland's cantons. For citizens to call for the constitution's repeal or amendment is unheard of: they are legally prohibited from petitioning the government to make such changes. Nevertheless, the liberal ideas left behind by Napoleon's rule clearly are still showing their influence. This will definitely not be the last call by our people for fair representation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051841;Never before have our people made such strong demands against our government while also not shedding a drop of blood. Today, discontent locals in the Freiamt region of Aargau canton led an uprising in protest of reduced rural representation in the constitution. They demonstrated their resolve by organizing themselves into militias. Despite clashes across Freiamt where about 6,000 total militia members confronted Swiss forces--with both sides prepared to engage--not a single shot was fired. Miraculously, the government agreed to a revision to the constitution and negotiated an end to the uprising. This marks an indelible end to the illiberal, undemocratic government before Napoleon's time, where the government could get away with unequal or unfair representation of the people. Aargau was ruled particularly heavy-handedly by governor Johannes Herzog, who has been claimed to want to run a duchy instead of a canton. Well, his tyranny ends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051843;The tyrannical general Resid Mehmed has at long last acted on the Ottomans' behalf to tighten their choke hold on the Albanian people.

When they arrived, the beys were greeted by a military procession--but the next thing they knew, upon a hand signal from Mehmed, the Turkish soldiers opened fire on the beys and killed them all. \n\nThe Ottomans have removed the one element in the government we could count on to stop our full annexation. Lest we let our dream of an independent Albania die out, we must rally our people and declare a war for our liberation against the Ottomans--right now. Our surviving political leaders have already organized soldiers to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051844;General Resid Mehmed has taken rash action to tighten our grip on the administration in Albania by committing a massacre against Albanian beys, traditional chieftains. About 500 of them were invited to a meeting where they were told they were to be rewarded for their loyalty to the government at. They attended, and after their arrival they were greeted by a ceremonial solute parade of soldiers, which was in fact an ambush. Upon a sign from Resid Mehmed, they fired upon the beys, slaughtering them all. This massacre comes as a response to the behavior of the Pashaliks of Yanina and Shkodra, who had ambitions to finally create an independent Albania. But the Albanian people will not stand for this--they have already taken up arms to challenge our forces head-on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a result, instead of losing our autonomy, we have won independence by clutching victory from the jaws of defeat. As a new era dawns upon our country, Mustafa Bushati has assumed a new title: A pasha no longer, he is now the Sultan of Albania. Now that we are forever free from the Ottoman yoke, a bright future awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CONCEPCIONEARTHQUAKE;A devastating earthquake has hit Concepción and nearby Talcahuano today at 11:30 AM. The quake combined with a resulting tsunami have left Concepción destroyed, with most buildings in ruins. Miraculously, though, casualties have remained low, with only 50 people reported dead. The lack of deaths is attributable to how the quake was slow to intensify and happened at about high noon, allowing locals to get to safety in time. Charles Darwin happened to be in Concepción as the earthquake struck, on a stop for the second voyage of the HMS Beagle. He would describe the quake as such: "I happened to be on shore, and was lying down in the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly, and lasted two minutes, but the time appeared much longer. The rocking of the ground was very sensible . . . The people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm. It is these accompaniments that create that perfect horror of earthquakes, experienced by all who have thus seen, as well as felt, their effects.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The barrage killed 18 people but only minorly wounded Louis-Philippe, and Fieschi was immediately captured. \n\nIt has since then been discovered that four barrels of the volley gun did not fire due to the components' failure. Surely more would have died, including the King, had the weapon worked as intended. Fieschi is imprisoned and awaiting trial, while Pépin and Morey are still at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

start_the_chaos_srn_desc;We were established in 1399 and subjugated by the Turks in 1554. We have stayed their peaceable vassal for several centuries, but Mir Mohammed has other plans - the expansion of our army and land. A good first step should be taking on the emirate to our north, Bahdinan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BAHDINANISSORAN;Soran was established in 1399 and subjugated by the Turks in 1554. Lately, they have begun waging war on neighboring principalities, hoping to become the dominant Kurdish tribe. They have reached our borderlands and issued an ultimatum - surrender or face the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BAHDINANISNTTUR;Our vassal, the Soran Emirate, had suspiciously been building up its army without an apparent reason. A week ago, their armies entered our vassal to their north, Bahdinan, and since then they have been at war. Soran still is a loyal vassal on paper, but it could easily devolve into a war for independence very soon. As concerning as the situation is, must we delay intervention, we will be better prepared to put down Soran, and Bahdinan had never been too loyal anyway, as the local Yazidis have influence in their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BAHDINANISTUR;Our vassal, the Soran Emirate, had suspiciously been building up its army without an apparent reason. Today, their armies have entered our vassal to their north, Bahdinan, and advanced. Soran still is a loyal vassal on paper, but it could easily devolve into a war for independence very soon. Bahdinan has asked for our intervention to conserve the stability of the Qajar-Ottoman border and the balance of power of the Kurdish principalities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquer_kirkuk_title;Conquer Kirkük;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquer_kirkuk_desc;The Baban Emirate has always sought to weaken our state and once occupied half of our lands. Their emir is greedy and is allied with the Yazidis, to whom he grants amnesties and asylum. The people of Kirkük are constantly oppressed by Baban, and factions of the local militias have signaled that they'd join our offensive. It might be time to fix the greatest error the Soran Emirate has ever done - letting Baban exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABANISSORAN;Baban was once a great emirate that ruled lands in what is now Soran and Ardalan, but the greed of the Ottoman and Qajar Empires and the contemporary rise in Soran's power have made us weaker and weaker. Today, Sorani troops have crossed the border in the north and into Kerkûk and militias in the region are siding with the invader. Our situation is precarious, but the Ottomans are distracted elsewhere, and their delayed response could bring suffering to the rest of the Ottoman Kurdish population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BABANISNTTUR;Baban was once a great emirate that ruled lands in what is now Soran and Ardalan, but their constant rebellions made them lose land to their neighbors through our and the Qajar's favors. Today, Sorani troops have crossed into Kerkûk, Baban, and are preparing to lay siege to the city. The Baban Emir has insisted that we don't intervene, and our army is not in conditions to attack Soran. Must we delay intervention, we will be better prepared to put down Soran, and we had already studied a campaign to pacify Baban's infidel Yarsinian and Yazidi populations, which influence their government, so this invasion in reality is a favor to our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ally_bohtan_singal_desc;The Bohtan are a powerful emirate that rules the city of Cizre and its surroundings, including Zaco. Their ruler, Bedir Khan Beg, also wants to liberate Kurdistan from Ottoman hands and has a similar approach. The lands of Singal are full of Yazidis that raid both their and our lands, and together we will be able to stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SORANWANTSTOKILLYAZIDISAGAINWHYYY;The Soran Emirate has sent a request for an alliance between our two nations against the Yazidi nation of Tasini. In exchange for our support and ceding Zaco, we will become their allies and fight together against the Ottomans. Should we accept we are expected to send troops to help with the invasion of Tasini. We, though, have to be careful with Soran's ruler, as his greed will grow the more land he takes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALLIANCETASINIGOODLUCK;Bohtan has agreed to our alliance to liberate our borders from the Yazidi of Tasini. They are expected to send their troops to Sinjar, but they might take some days to mobilize their army. Regardless, with this alliance we will be able to successfully fend off any Ottoman incursion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TASINIISSORAN;Soran has sent their army to our border and declared war to 'pacify our Yazidi population.' Their genocidal intentions are clear from miles away, but our chances to survive are few - the Ottomans support such an invasion and have looked the other way to most of their invasions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TASINIISNTTUR;The Soran Emirate has launched an invasion once more, this time towards Tasini and its Yazidi population. They are prone to rebellion, so any pacification of the region would actually be beneficial to our cause. Bohtan seems to agree with this stance, and some of their militias are present in the Sorani armies, so we might want to hold our horses for some more months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are prone to rebellion, so any pacification of the region would actually be beneficial to our cause. This stance, though, might be making our rule in Kurdistan weaker and weaker, so an intervention would put an end to this trend - if we were to win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TASINIWARBOHTAN;The Soran Emirate has asked that our armies join them in their invasion of Tasini, but moving our armies from Cizre might make us more vulnerable to an invasion by them. Soran has signaled to its local allies that we are not to be trusted, so we should be cautious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOHTANALLIANCENO;The Bohtan Emirate has refused to sign any alliances that contain ceding Zaco, ending any and all negotiations. They cite that their territorial integrity is key to a working relationship with our nation and that under no circumstances would they sign 'such a one-sided treaty.' The Ottomans are clearly behind this act, as their emir would never write like this to our great emir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOHTANALLIANCELEAVE;Bohtan has not sent significant forces to their border with Tasini for days now, and today they have sent an envoy saying that the Emir has left our alliance. Bohtan's emir might think we are traitors, but this is clearly a sign of the opposite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kill_bohtan_title;Occupy Bohtan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kill_bohtan_desc;The Bohtan Emirate is no more than a roadblock in our successful campaigns, and their Emir is constantly collaborating with the enemy. To realize our ultimate goal - we must end Bohtan's autonomy once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOHTANISSORAN;Soran has started a campaign to turn us into their satellite, as they deem us 'untrustworthy.' Our state is in grave peril, and the Soran Emirate is very powerful. We must ask the Ottoman Empire for help, or our population will suffer this occupation greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOHTANISNTTUR;The Bohtan Emirate has defied our rule more than once, and their recent actions in their alliance with Soran have confirmed our view of Cizre. Today, Sorani troops have crossed into the Bohtan Emirate in the Sorani's goal to centralize our Kurdish possessions. If we were to let them continue, they might end up annexing the entirety of our Kurdish emirates and principalities, and the more they conquer, the stronger they become. It might be time to intervene to end this trend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TURLOSTOHGOD;Our great and powerful army has lost against the Emirate of Soran, a puny and defenseless statelet and a rump shell of a nation. This should not repeat itself, or we'll find ourselves encircled on all sides by the European powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SORANWONHELLNO;In a great show of military prowess, our Kurdish state, deemed by many powers as weak and illegitimate, has won a war against the Great Ottoman Empire. This victory will be celebrated for centuries to come, starting today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SORANLOSTOHGOD;Our army has lost in the field of battle, no hope is left for our people and for the destiny of Kurdistan. We hope that our lands will someday be liberated from the hands of the Ottomans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TURWONSOMETHINGLESFGO;Our great and invincible army has defeated the armies of the Emirate of Soran, and it is now up to us what will happen with what is left from it. What is for sure is that the Soran Emirate must be permanently pacified so they never pose a threat to us anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CEASEFIRESORAN;The Ottoman Empire has proposed that we ceasefire for 20 months. It would benefit both parties, and we'd be able to hold onto conquered territories, Mosul and Dijarbakir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CEASEFIRESORANYES;The Soran Emirate has agreed to the 20-month ceasefire, and we can now prepare to restart our offensive. The Sorani Emirate will soon face our full force, and their dream of a unified Kurdistan will be no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CEASEFIRESORANNO;The Soran Emirate has refused to cease fire against all expectations. They seem to believe they can get a more promising peace treaty when they are losing the war on all fronts. It is time to end Soran once and for all - Rewandiz must burn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BAHDINANGENOCIDE;The fall of numerous cities in Southwestern Kurdistan has led to chaos and conflict throughout the region. An army led by Muhammad Kor has attacked multiple Assyrian and Yazidi settlements throughout Baban and Bahdinan, killing thousands and forcing others to migrate east and north. First he attacked settlements in Chemchemal and Kerkûk, killing more than seven thousand people and forcing more to escape to Suleymaniyah. Afterward they marched on the lands of the Bahdinan, attacking Sheikhan, Akre and Tall Kayf and killing thousands. Those who survived, about 10 thousand Yazidis, mostly women and children, and their ruler, Ali Beg, were forced to death march from their ancestral lands into Ravanduz, where they were asked to convert to Islam. Most if not all of them rejected the request and were massacred in a waterfall 90 miles north of Hewlêr, now named the Ali Beg Waterfall in his honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ZACOGENOCIDE;A month ago, Bedir Khan Beg, our emir and formerly Yazidi before converting to Islam years ago, continued the massacre started by the Sorani and launched an expedition into the Yazidi-majority regions of Zakho and Dêrik, killing thousands and enslaving even more. Those who managed to survive tried swimming through the Tigris to reach Sinjar, but not many survived.

Sinjal is full of refugees, and our finances are strained, but we should prepare to defend our lands now more than ever from a potential attack from Soran.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TASINIGENOCIDE;The Sorani expedition into Tasini has caused an unimaginable human toll on the local population. The Tasini mountains are home to most of the Yazidi that have survived the massacres in Dêrik, Zaco, Akre, Tall Kayf and Kerkûk, and Muhammad Beg's army was dead set on massacring everyone that escaped their 'pacification' of Bahdinan and Baban. Today, Muhammad Beg's army has dealt a huge blow to the local Yazidi population, killing up to 15 thousand people and forcing many to escape to Assyrian lands in Tur Abdin, Western Bohtan, where they are protected by them. Thousands are now homeless as Sinjar and 200 other settlements have been burned and their wealth taken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SERTDEFENDEDSUCCESS;A battle between the Yazidi-Assyrian resistance in Tur Abdin, Siirt, and forces led by Muhammad Beg has occurred today. The Assyrian-Yazidi joint army, against all odds, has been able to force Beg to retreat and sign a treaty that prohibits him from further attacks on Tur Abdin or the surrounding regions, bringing an end to the genocide he was perpetrating in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hakkari_was_based_before_eighteenfourty_title;Attack Hakkari;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hakkari_was_based_before_eighteenfourty_desc;Hakkari is a powerful Kurdish emirate with a large Assyrian minority that is centered on the Hakkari mountains. The mountains of Hakkari were once part of our emirate, but the Ottoman Empire forced us to give up lands in the region after our defeat three hundred years ago. Now it is time to undo this injustice and conquer Hakkari.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAKKARIISSORAN;The Emirate of Soran has attacked our border posts today after intense drills were made close to our borders and the state of Bahdinan fell into their hands. The Sorani are powerful, but we have an ace uo our sleeves - the Assyrian population is highly trained in battle and know the Hakkari Mountains by heart. We could ask the Ottomans for help, which they could reject, or take a chancne at defending ourselves from the Sorani menace with the Assyrians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAKKARIISTUR;The Emirate of Soran has attacked Hakkari today to take it from our hands. Should we be able to send troops, we might be able to successfully defend them, but the Sorani army is still strong and completely able to win a war against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This expedition should help pacify most of Kurdistan and bring an end to the local revolts, sending governors to the highlands and establishing control over those that do not agree with the policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUNTOYOURHEADKURDISHSTATE;The Ottoman Empire has demanded that we give in to the governor of Sivas, Reshid Mehmed Pasha's demands - that we become vassals of the Ottoman Empire and cease to send help to the rebelling emirates south of us. This, of course, would mean an end to our de facto independent rule while maintaining most of our sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

make_conquer_kurds_desc;With our victory against Hakkari we can now look further north. The principalities of Bitlis, Bayazid and Zirqan have long been largely neutral to our actions in Southern Kurdistan, but our victory in Hakkari has scared most from allying with us, some having even asked for help from the Ottoman Empire. It is clear that to keep our sovereignty intact, we must invade these principalities and secure our border with the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SORANWANTSSYOUDEAD;The Soran Emirate has demanded that we join their fight against the Ottoman Empire, or we'll be invaded. This is a clear violation of the neutrality we had enjoyed up to this point, and the only guarantor of our independence is the Ottoman Empire. It may be time to ask for help from the Ottoman Empire and declare war on the Soran Emirate to end its independence and oppression of fellow Kurds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SORANWANTSSYOUDEADNO;The Soran Emirate has attacked $FROMCOUNTRY$ in a new offensive in Northern Kurdistan. They have not asked for help, as they see the battle lost and prefer that we declare war on Soran when we are better prepared, but the decision to intervene is up to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SORANWANTSSYOUDEADYES;The Soran Emirate has attacked $FROMCOUNTRY$ in a new offensive in Northern Kurdistan.

AVIEHOWSITGOINGBAD;When the Ottoman Empire signed a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire, their border was set in Samarra, south of Mosul. As we rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and took those lands, they never received all the lands they were promised. Today the Soran Emirate has sent us an ultimatum - cede Mosul, or the entirety of the Sorani military will be sent to burn $CAPITAL$ to the ground. The Sorani think they can force this treaty on us, but they have not seen our military prowess fending off the Ottoman Empire from our lands. Should they attack, the Sorani Emirate will be soundly defeated and our armies victorious once again. Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

urmia_is_soran_desc;Our armies have been strengthened by conquests once more, and it is only natural that we continue our expansion into the rest of Kurdistan under the Qajar Dynasty's control. They have oppressed the Kurds of the region for decades, and the Ardalan deserve to be annexed for helping Baban three hundred years ago annex us. It is time to unleash our military on the mountains of Ardalan and Urmia and place them under our great state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WHYWOULDYOUEVENDOTHIS;The Sorani Emirate has just done its worst move since its invasion of Baban three hundred years ago - they have declared war on us to conquer the whole of Kurdistan. They think they can win against our great army, when they don't have support even inside our Kurdish community. The Sorani Emirate is destined to fall, and we will be the ones to place the last nail in their coffin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But more often than not, these settlers will need a considerable amount of funding to ensure their livelihood in the new land. Thus, as the mother nation, it is seen as our duty to provide for their needs. The question is how much money we shall offer them, if at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGADEADAF;With our newfound victory over the Algerians, we must continue the fight against the tribesmen who are holding out, rallying in the hinterland against colonial rule. Hussein Bey, the former ruler of Algeria has gone into exile in Naples as the populace has lost all confidence in his rule due to his defeat. In the East, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Sherif, the Bey of Constantine, has now claimed to be Hussein Bey's legitimate successor as ruler of Algeria. In this power vacuum, a new figure has emerged: Abdelkader ibn Muhieddine, a minor sharif and islamic scholar has rallied the tribes to resist us in unison. We know, however that such backwards, unorganized rabble cannot stop us! Soon, all of Algeria shall be ours! Vive la France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGADEADAFRGA;Due to our calamitous defeat at the hands of the French and the loss of our capital, Algiers, the government has collapsed. Hussein Bey, the regent of Algiers, has gone into exile in Naples, having lost all vestiges of popular support. In the East, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Sherif, the Bey of Constantine, has now claimed to be Hussein Bey's legitimate successor as ruler of Algeria, pledging to drive out the French. In the rest of the former Bey's domains, a new leader has emerged: Abd al-Qadir ibn Muhyi al-Din, also known as Emir Abdelkader, an Islamic scholar and Sufi, has become both the religious and military leader of most of Algeria. Taking advantage of the power vacuum left by the fleeing Bey, Abdelkader has been elected as Amir al-Mu'minin or Emir by the disparate tribes of Algeria to unite them against their common foe: The French. Who will prevail remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCETROLLED;France has pathetically attempted to conquer our great nation, and they have failed, as they had failed in Egypt in 1800, Haiti in 1804, and Russia in 1812.

TUZCUOGLUREVOLTS;A rebellion has risen within the Sanjak of Lazistan, resisting the installment of derebeys--local governors--who are cruel and care most about consolidating Ottoman control. This comes as a result of a blood feud between the Hazinedaroglu and Tuzcuoglu families, both of whom have vied for control of Lazistan as derebeys. Derebey Adjara Osman Hazinedaroglu has used his authority to levy large taxes on his subjects, which contributed to food scarcity in 1829 and 1830. Locals have now begun to stop paying taxes and rebel, with rival Derebey Tahir Aga Tuzcuoglu as their leader. We cannot allow Tuzcuoglu to continue his defiance. We must put an end to the rabble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Under this constitution, Uruguay will be represented by a president and a two-chamber legislative branch consisting of the Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Senators. Meanwhile, supreme legal power will be put in the hands of the Supreme Court of Justice. The constitution will also strengthen the federal government's authority--so much so that our country will be considered a unitary republic.

anglo_ashanti_treaty_desc;Border conflicts with the Ashanti Empire have been a constant occurrence since we first established our colony on the Gold Coast. With it obvious, though, that the Ashanti cannot fully repel our troops and retake that land, perhaps we should send them an ultimatum. We shall force an agreement that our borders will lie on the opposite banks of the Pra River, the natural boundary of the Gold Coast colony. Of course, there's nothing stopping us from eventually breaking this treaty and conquering them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051835;Border conflicts with the British are continuing with no end in sight, lest one of us falls entirely or agrees to peace terms. Britain has come to us with an ultimatum: that we recognize their sovereignty over the Gold Coast colony and share a natural border along the Pra River. This will put us at peace for the meantime and, unfortunately, leave our brethren on the coast at Britain's whim. But war is tiring, and we've certainly had our share of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

romania_semiconst_1831_desc;While the Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moladvia are Ottoman vassals, we have retained garrisons in them since the war of 1828-29. The populace is becoming increasingly resentful of this, especially as we have confiscated Wallachia and Moldavia's treasuries for the time being. It is up to us to shape their governments for the better and hand them back control over their finances. The proposed Organic Regulation would form the organic law, or legal system forming the basis of government, of the principalities. It would establish a national assembly in Iasi and Bucharest elected by no more than 3000 of the most influential citizens. Furthermore, the Organic Regulation would, among other things, ensure the independence of the judiciary and establish a poll tax in place of the old indirect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REGULAMENTULORGANIC;Russia has imposed a legal system forming the basis of government on us:  the so-called Regulamentul Organic, or "Organic Regulation." This semi-constitutional document returns to us the Russian-confiscated treasury, establishes a national assembly elected by the three thousand most influential citizens, ensures the independence of the judiciary and replaces the old indirect taxes with a poll tax among many other reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They have rallied their forces in the city of Maracaibo and begun marching East to take Caracas. Now, in turn, José Antonio Páez, the man who split Venezuela from Gran Colombia and spelled its doom has returned from retirement and assembled militia to join the struggle on the government's side. It seems that the old rivalry between proponents and detractors of Gran Colombia is to play out one final time--on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_title;The Peruvian Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_desc;Now that the Bermudists have been defeated, we can finally set about finishing the new constitution. The proposed draft mostly reiterates the 1828 constitution and follows its liberal spirit but makes some adjustments to combat instability which has been experienced since. For example, the post of vice-president would be removed due to the bad contact of former VP Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente. Another example is the prohibition of immediate presidential reelection, a tactic used by Augustín Gamarra to elongate his presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCONGRESSPRU;The 1828 Constitution had agreed that in 1833, five years later, a new constitution would be formulated to adapt to the new situation of our country and possibly implement a federal system. Thus, a constitutional congress has gathered and heald a vote to elect a provisional president until the new constitution is finished. Pretenders for the position were the liberal Luis José de Obregoso, the conservative Pedro Pablo Bermúdez and the independent Domingo Nieto. Obregoso won with 47 votes to Bermúdez's 36 and Nieto's 1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCIVILWAR;Pedro Pablo Bermúdez has rejected the result of the constitutional convention's election of José de Obregoso and risen up in revolt, beginning a civil war. While Bermúdez enjoys the support of most of the army, the populace of Lima and Arequipa are on the side of Obregoso, forcing Bermudist troops to retreat from the cities, unable to capture them with the adamant opposition of the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAQUINHUAYOEMBRACE;The civil war has been divided along three fronts: The Orbegosista General Domingo Nieto faced off against the Bermudista General Miguel de San Román in the South, General Felipe Santiago Salaverry fought General Francisco de Vidal in the North and General Luis José de Orbegoso battled General Pedro Bermúdez himself in the central mountains east of Lima. After a number of minor skirmishes over the past few months, the Bermudista officers have lost morale. Without popular support, they have recognized that theirs is a lost cause, and decided to depose Bermúdez from the leadership of the rebel army. Upon reaching the Maquinhuayo Plain, the former Bermudista forces then encountered the Orbegosistas, who had entered a battle formation. To the surprise of the Orbegosistas, the former Bermudistas laid down their arms, whereupon both armies met each other and the soldiers clasped in a fraternal embrace. The civil war is over, and Peru is once again at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

belgium_const_1831_title;The Belgian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
belgium_const_1831_desc;Belgium's existence is extraordinary, considering how divided along linguistic and cultural lines our two major ethnic groups are. Nevertheless, it is our duty to consolidate our brand-new nation, uniting the Flemish, the Walloons and the small German minority. We shall create a constitutional monarchy, a compromise between liberals and the conservatives. The state will have three branches of government and afford privileges to the Catholic Church. Basic freedoms such as that of expression, worship, and the press will be guaranteed. However, only landed subjects will be able to vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANANTHEM;The lyrics of La Brabançonne, a song that has become a rallying cry for Belgian nationalism, were written by a French mercenary serving in Brussels who died in action. The first version of the lyrics originally scolded rioters and claimed that the Dutch Prince of Orange would be an "example for kings" and a "father to Belgium" if he granted Belgium independence. However, following the bombardment of Antwerp, the lyrics were altered to condemn the Dutch for their brutality. François van Campenhout set the second version to the tune of "L'Air des lancers polonais" ("Song of the Polish Lancers"), and it was an immediate success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMATELUX;The people of the Duchy of Luxembourg have also joined the struggle for Belgian independence. However, the fortress-city capital of the province itself remains under Dutch control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKING;The National Congress has decided that Belgium should be a constitutional monarchy, and so the country needs a king. Anti-Dutch sentiment has ruled out any candidate from the House of Nassau, which is the dynasty of the Dutch king. Supporters of a closer connection with France have proposed the Duke of Nemours, who is the second son of the French King. The candidacy of the Duke of Nemours, however, makes the other great powers uneasy, as it undermines the usefulness of Belgium as a barrier against the French. The British have instead suggested Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg as a more neutral option. Other candidates being considered include Duke Auguste of Leuchtenberg, a Bonapartist, and Prince Otho of Bavaria. Our representatives at the ongoing Congress of London report that the Congress prefers Leopold, and choosing otherwise may try the patience of the great powers involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGBOR;The National Congress has decided that Belgium should be a constitutional monarchy, which means that the country needs a king. Current anti-Dutch sentiment has ruled out any candidate from the House of Nassau, which is the dynasty of the Dutch king. The most popular candidate is Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. Leopold had previously been offered the Greek throne, which he rejected over concerns that the Greeks were not being treated fairly. Other candidates being considered include Duke Auguste of Leuchtenberg, a Bonapartist, and Prince Otho of Bavaria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRANCE;Belgium has sent us an emissary to propose the coronation of the Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe as king of Belgium. While this would give us much influence over Belgium, it would surely attract the ire of the British and Prussians. Additionally, Belgium's industry, which is larger than ours, would, by increased interaction with our economy, hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRBEL;King Louis-Philippe has given the go-ahead to the coronation of the Duke of Nemours. Celebrations have begun amid his arrival in Brussels. Belgium finally has a king, and a popular one at that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSABONKFR;The Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe of France, has been crowned king of Belgium at the bequest of the provisional government. This act spreads the influence of the French revolution further throughout Europe and endangers the old order. With the Louis-Philippe's son on the throne, Belgium is now a French protectorate in all but name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNO;Louis-Philippe has refused to let his son become king of France. The reason he gives for this is twofold: On the one hand, he does not wish to raise the ire of the other European powers, specifically Prussia and the UK, by extending his influence. On the other hand, Belgium's industry far outmatches France's and economic intermingling between the two would hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGBRIISH;Belgium has sent us an emissary proposing the coronation of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as their king. While it would definitely increase our influence on Belgium, we would get mixed up in their ongoing conflict with the Dutch. An agreement called the "Treaty of the Eighteen Articles" has been proposed which would agree to the coronation of Leopold under the condition that the matters of Limburg and Luxembourg are for Britain to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNOBLE;The British have outright refused to let Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha become our king, wanting to have nothing to do with our revolutionary state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGENGYES;The British have given the OK to the coronation of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. He has already arrived in Brussels amid much jubilation. Belgium finally has a king, and a popular one at that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMAKINGENGTROLL;The British have agreed to have Leopold be crowned king of Belgium. However, they have demanded that we first sign the so-called "Treaty of the Eighteen Articles." This document would give Britain ultimate authority to decide the fate of Limburg and Luxembourg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMAKINGENGTROLLYES;Belgium has agreed to sign the Treaty of the Eighteen Articles in faith that we will make a fair judgment over the issue of Limburg and Luxembourg. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will, after all, be king of Belgium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMAKINGENGTROLLYNO;Belgium has refused to sign the Treaty of the Eighteen Articles, for they lack faith that we will make a fair judgment over the issue of Limburg and Luxembourg. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will not, after all, be king of Belgium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMINDEPENDENCE;Even after the southern provinces had become de facto independent, the Dutch King still hoped for a diplomatic solution that would lessen the blow of losing them. He appointed Prince William as governor of the southern provinces at the beginning of the month and empowered him to form an independent administration there. The experiment was to end within that same month. Few Belgians took the authority of Prince William seriously, and when at the end of the month General Chassé reacted to a disturbance in Antwerp by bombarding the city, the people were galvanized against Dutch rule. Delegates were sent to the national conference at the beginning of the following month with a mandate to cut ties with the House of Orange, and two weeks later the provisional government declared the independence of Belgium. It remains to be seen whether the ongoing Congress of London about the Belgian situation will recognize the new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEPTEMBERDAYS;It had seemed that Prince Frederick and his 12,000-strong army would soon restore order to Brussels. The leaders of the revolution had fled the city, and a number of the notable burghers had promised their support. And yet, the city still resisted the prince. Upon entry, soldiers were met in some quarters with stones and bricks thrown from rooftops, and with sniper fire in others. They managed to secure much of the northern city on the first day, advancing as far as the Parc, but there the advance stalled. While the army could have brought the city to heel by bombardment and house-to-house fighting, doing so would have been a bloody affair. Prince Frederick was unwilling to conclude what had been intended as a police action with a massacre, and so, after three days of intermittent skirmishing, he withdrew from the city. The revolutionaries claim this as a great victory and have called for an uprising across the southern provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRUSSELSRIOTS;The hard winter of the previous year, combined with the general economic downturn, has increased existing tensions between the northern and southern provinces. Differences in religion and language, as well as the government's preference for the north, have long created a rift between the two parts of the nation, and the grievances of the southern provinces are published nearly daily in the 'Courrier des Pays-Bas'. This dissatisfaction finally found an expression outside of the pages of a newspaper following a performance in Brussels of 'La Muette de Portici', an opera about the Neapolitan revolution. Attendees leaving after act four precipitated turning an already-agitated crowd outside into a riot, which then spread throughout the city unchecked for two days. Order was eventually restored by an unofficial 'burgher guard'. However, far from ending the trouble, this new force has turned into a revolutionary committee, refuses to allow the military to enter Brussels, and is now demanding a separation between the northern and southern provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANENG;France has proposed that we partition Belgium instead of recognizing it. We would receive Ghent and Antwerp, while France would get Wallonia and Brussels, Prussia would be given Luxemburg and Liège, and the Dutch would receive Limburg and Hasselt. Antwerp's port would be the most likely to be used to launch an invasion of our isles with its large, close port. Thus, its control would be immensely beneficial to our defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

THEFLAHAUTPLANFAILS;Other powers in Europe have refused to agree to the Flahaut plan, denouncing it as unjust to the Belgian cause and unfairly imbalanced to favor us. Thus, without support of the others, the plan cannot go ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ASSAMQUESTION;The Assamese kingdom of Kachari was assisted by British forces in its liberation from Burmese occupation in the Anglo-Burmese War. It makes up part of the larger region of Assam, a strip of land above Bengal comprising the fertile Brahmaputra river valley. The previous king of Kachari, Govinda Chandra Hasnu, has died and is succeeded by an heir friendly to British interests. This heir, Senapati Tularam Thaosen, is willing to give up the throne in exchange for British protection--allowing us to annex Kachari into the East India Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The locals, however, do not easily consent to foreign rule. There is a way around this: we could restore native autonomy in the region by installing a king as tributary. The king we have in mind is Purandar Singha, a prince of the Ahom Kingdom. Under our plan, he will be installed as a ruler in Upper Assam, guaranteeing our undisputed dominance in the region without directly governing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;

OHWELLDUTCHNVASION;The Dutch have crossed into Antwerp province, ready to engage our forces and crush our noble revolution. As of now, they are advancing into the forests around Ravels, and Zondereigen has been taken at the cost of 400 Belgian troops being repelled. These troops are clearly better trained and equipped than our own, and their leadership includes the Prince of Orange himself, eager to see his kingdom's reunification through by any means. We must not resign to possible defeat. Our future lies in our own hands, not the House of Orange's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OHWELLDUTCHNVASIONFRA;The separatist Kingdom of Belgium requests our support in fighting off the Dutch for independence. Helping them is tempting, as it weakens the Netherlands and allows us to possibly place a new country on our border under our thumbs. Our people will also doubtlessly sympathize with Belgium's Walloons, who speak a Gallo-Romance dialect similar to French and were made our subjects during Napoleon I's rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OHWELLDUTCHNVASIONET;The rebels now have French backing.

However, we will still keep a large majority of ethnically Greek lands, including Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace, while Egypt will be ceded Crete for helping suppress the revolt there.

spanish_inquisition_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! The Tribune of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, commonly called the Spanish Inquisition, is the police force responsible for enforcing strict observance of Catholicism in the Spanish Empire. Established at the end of the Reconquista, it oversaw the mass conversion and expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain, and since then it has been responsible for enforcing the consolidation of the Spanish crown's rule by ensuring Catholicism unites its disparate subjects. But the Inquisition is not what it used to be. It was temporarily abolished under Joseph Bonaparte's reign and was reinstated by Ferdinand VII in 1814. Liberalism continues to weaken the Inquisition's strength to eradicate Christian heterodoxy. The organization has been reduced to a censorship committee, rarely overseeing prosecutions anymore. Perhaps it is time to disband the Inquisition and bury its legacy in the sand dunes of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, the defenders would easily be overwhelmed before reinforcements could arrive. It is, however, possible that an Afghan force will arrive over the pass after Peshawar is in our hands to recapture it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

july_ordinances_desc;§RCauses a Revolution§! Liberalism is a scourge upon the monarchy. It must be put down through a heavy-handed approach to ruling France's subjects, lest we fail to save the French people from their naive ideas of how they wish to be governed. Chief Minister Jules Armand de Polignac, an ultraroyalist who has long been targeted by the liberals, proposes a set of royal ordinances meant to reign France in: they include limitation of press freedom, a newly appointed set of reactionary Councilors of State, the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, and the exclusion of the middle class from future elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEIZUREOFLENATIONAL;In response to the July Ordinances' restrictions on press freedom, staff writers at the liberal newspaper Le National published a petition demanding restoration of their rights. Agents of the prince de Polignac then promptly raided the journal's offices. Le National originated as a liberal mouthpiece in light of de Polignac's rise to power, patronized by liberal officials such as the prince of Talleyrand and the duke of Broglie. The paper's existence proves a thorn in the state's backside. We maintain that the government acted fully in its authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JULYREVOLUTION;The Bourbon monarchy is no longer in France as of today. After the surge of reactionary behavior under Chief Minister de Polignac--who was narrowly re-elected after having been voted out in a motion of no confidence--the French people were ignited to relaunch a revolution in the spirit of the first. De Polignac foolishly attempted to singlehandedly alter France's constitution by passing the draconian July Ordinances, attempting to create a newly authoritarian monarchy. Rioting and looting has dragged on for three days, until the people finally captured the Hôtel de Ville in Paris and declared a provisional government, after wholly defeating the last of the royalists' forces. A new monarchy is expected to emerge with Louis Philippe of Orléans, a former Republican general, as king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOUISPHILLIPETROLLS;France's new king has taken the throne: Louis Philippe of Orléans. As duke of Chartres and a former general of the Revolutionary Wars, he served with distinction but later broke with the revolutionaries after they decided to kill King Louis XVI. He later exiled himself to Switzerland in 1793 after it was discovered he was conspiring to restore the monarchy. \n\nCharles X had named Louis Philippe his lieutenant general, though he not-so-secretly held ambitions to succeed Charles as king. Already popular among the masses, the Chamber of Deputies has appointed Louis Philippe I as the first in the Orléans dynasty--hopefully marking a return to the center-right policies of Napoleon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This address demands that Chief Minister Polignac resign and that future ministers pledge to act in accordance with the wishes of Parliament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JUNEREBELLION;Fighting has broken out between the National Guard and republican rebels, who have conspired to overthrow the July Monarchy. After the funeral of former army commander and anti-monarchist Jean Maximilien Lamarque, riots emerged as citizens sympathetic to his beliefs attempted to make their opinions against the government heard. Attacks against our forces were swift and well-organized, carried out by secret societies such as the infamous Society of the Rights of Men, whose members stockpile weapons as if building an army. Their fighters were reinforced by disaffected Parisien youth and refugees from Germany, Poland, and Italy, each of whom were being pursued by their respective governments for participating in republican activism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Carbonari's ultimate goal, however, is the unification of Italy. To their chagrin, Austria is bound to intervene militarily in any Italian uprising so as to preserve the status quo. Therefore, the Italian revolutionaries request that we guarantee that Austria does not get involved - to the point of sending our army to aid the Italians should the Austrians not heed our warning.

VENDEEETCHOUANNERIE;Legitimist sentiment is rising in the departement of the Vendée, within Brittany. Legitimists pledge allegiance to the House of Orléans as the rightful heir to the monarchy, and are willing to attack French forces to see the installment of an Orléans dynasty through. Charles X, who was exiled to Scotland following the July Revolution, has given up on reclaiming the throne. It has thus been concluded that his daughter-in-law, Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Siciles, must be orchestrating the unrest, for she has been promoting her young son Henri's claim to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIESTARTS;The struggle against the Legitimist rebels in the Vendée has escalated to open combat. Troops must now rally to engage the rabble! Legitimist generals like Louis de Bourmont and Charles de Beaumont d'Autichamp who left France when king Louis Philippe took the throne have returned to spearhead the revolt. But however good its generals may be, the rebellion is comprised of the very conservative rural populace of the region who have little to no experience in combat. Additionally, the rebels lack guns and ammunition which they had hoped to get in the form of foreign support of which there is none forthcoming. \n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEBOR;The Legitimist revolution is a success. France now has a new king: Henri of Orléans, former Duke of Chambourd. Henri was not in the line of succession for the throne under the current Bourbon dynasty, though his mother, Marie-Caroline, Duchess of Berry, resented his exclusion. Two of Henri's ancestors and members of the Bourbon-Two Sicilies house create a perfect line of descendence from King Louis XVI, the first French Bourbon monarch. Thus, Marie-Caroline considers Henri the rightful king and herself regent. She collaborated with Legitimist militants to install her son--and the results now speak for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEFRA;The Duchess of Berry has been connected to the now-defeated Legitimist insurrection in the Vendée. Having resented her son Henri's not being in the line of succession on the French throne, she collaborated with militants to see Henri installed. Her resentment is driven by how Henri is directly descended from King Louis XVI, and also has a mother from his same royal house. Because of this, some legitimists see Henri as the rightful king, after the abdications of Charles X and Louis Antoine. \n\nThe Duchess was arrested today and will remain incarcerated for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

desert_campaign_malones_desc;Under the military command of our former national leader, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Argentina has finally taken the initiative to expand her borders into the desert in the southern Pampas and northern Patagonia. These lands are the homes of indigenous tribes such as the Mapuche and Ranqueles, whom we experience friction with due to frequent border raids on our territories by them. The campaign has several front lines, spanning from the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes. By its end, we will have subjugated the Indians and expanded our domain to allow immigrants to settle in its heretofore untamed frontiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAAHUMANU;Following the death of Kamehameha II during his visit to England, Queen Ka'ahumanu became the regent of Hawai’i. The favorite wife of Kamehameha I, the founder of the kingdom, she wields a great amount of influence in the kingdom as she reigns over the minority of her stepson Kamehameha III. \nA devout Christian ever since her conversion in 1824, she has been notable for stamping out pagan practices in the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;
AGAINSTANIMISTS;Today, the Kuhina Nui has proposed an edict against a range of Hawaiian religious practices, including the worship of idols, the consumption of the intoxicating ‘awa plant, and the Hula dance. \nIn effect, she proposes to outlaw native Hawaiian religion entirely. Although well supported by the priests and ruling chiefs, this move would be despised by much of the peasantry and traditionalist elements of the islands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAAHUMANUDIES;The Kuhina Nui, Ka’ahumanu, has died at the age of sixty-four. Both feared and beloved in life, her regency passes now to her step-daughter and daughter-in-law Kina'u. Many Hawaiians sill aligning with their native beliefs have breathed a sigh of relief at this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LONDONCONFERENCESTARTS;France, Russia and the UK have finished a conference in London to definitively delineate our borders and establish a permanent government. Their decision was to move our border a bit further North to the so-called Arta-Volos line and to install a Catholic Bavarian prince by the name of Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern. Another demand of the three guarantors is the final abolition of slavery in Greece. While this agreement would hand a significant amount of currently Ottoman land to us, having a German Catholic on our throne is almost unacceptable. However, if we refuse to abide by the conference's terms, our former guarantors may abandon us in the event of an Ottoman attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONDONCONFERENCE1832;France, Russia and the UK have finished a conference in London to establish a permanent government in Greece and definitively delineate its borders. Their decision was to move the border a bit further North to the so-called Arta-Volos line and install a Catholic Bavarian prince by the name of Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern. This means that we would lose even more land to the Greeks than had previously already been agreed on in the convention of 1830. However, if we refuse to conform to the will of the three guarantors of Greek independence, they will surely support Greek expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONDONCONFERENCENOGRE;The Ottomans have refused to turn over the land they were made to hand over per the London Conference, instead launching an invasion to end our independence. The great powers will surely aid us in the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONDONCONFERENCENOGPS;We and the other two great powers guaranteeing Greek independence held a conference in London to establish Greece's permanent government and definitively delineate its borders. In lieu of this, the three guarantors--Russia, France and the UK--decided to install Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern as the Greek king and extend the border North to the so-called Volos-Arta line. This has, however, infuriated the Ottomans, who refuse to amend the more favorable border agreed on in 1830. They have begun a full-scale invasion of Greece, and it is our duty to protect it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONDONCONFENOGPSTUR;The Greek government has refused to abide by the terms of the London Conference in which France, Russia and the UK, the three guarantors of Greek independence, agreed on Greece's final borders and form of government. The insistence on having a Bavarian catholic be installed on the Greek throne was simply unacceptable. However, by rejecting the terms of the powers that had had its back, Greece has foolishly lost its international protection. We can use this opportunity to declare war on them to put an end to Greek independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BATTLEOFMACTA;Our troops have been shown the folly of getting too cocky in their battles. After fighting a hard yet inconclusive battle against Algerian troops, the French army retreated toward Arzeu to resupply, when they were ambushed in the marshes by the Macta River. The attacking Arab force managed to force our soldiers to retreat even further, undoing our territorial gains in this war. The military governor of our North African possessions, Comte d'Erlon, has been recalled for this embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FERDINANDEAISLAND;A mysterious island never seen before has been discovered off the southwestern Sicilian coast. Its discovery was preceded by reports of significant earthquakes and a smell of sulfur pervading the Sicilian town of Sciacca--the following day the Italian brig Gustavo reported a bubbling from the sea that seemed connected enough to the strange occurrences. \n\nWithin a few days, the island had materialized, presumably after surfacing from the ocean. \n\nThis island certainly will be useful for connecting trade routes in the Mediterranean--highly valuable real estate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FERDINANDEAISLANDF;As cruel fortune would have it! In the heat of disputes over control of the enigmatic Ferdinandea Island between the UK, France, Sicily, Spain, and France, the island disappeared into the ocean. The island's surface was made of tephra, or soft volcanic material easily swept away by waves. Ferdinandea likely gave out due to wave activity, and its surface retreated below sea level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ecuador_const_1830_title;The Ecuadorian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ecuador_const_1830_desc;The separation of the Districto del Sur from Gran Colombia birthed the new state of Ecuador. As a former province of that once large yet eventually ungovernable country, we lack a national identity--and a constitution. President Juan José Flores has called a assembly to draft our future constitution to proclaim the State of Ecuador. With this said, our intention is to eventually rejoin a future confederated Colombia as one of its constitutent countries. Thus the constitution will contain no clause contradicting Colombia's constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ecuador_const_1835_title;The Ecuadorian Constitution of 1835;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ecuador_const_1835_desc;Juan José Flores' authoritarian policies have left him unpopular with the public--so much so that rebellions favoring the ascension of Vicente Rocafuerte to the presidency have broken out, leaving Flores' hands tied. He was forced to agree to handing the presidency to Rocafuerte while appointing himself as chief military commander. This power vacuum leaves us in a constitutional crisis. Our instability makes aspirations to rejoin Colombia impossible, and we must solidify our identity as a sovereign nation. Ecuador shall be independent forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAPOLEONTHESECONDDIES;The fated heir to Napóleon I's empire passed away today of tuberculosis. \n\nBorn in 1811, Napóleon II had been named Prince Imperial per the French Empire's constitution and was proclaimed King of Rome by his overly proud father. He reigned over France for two weeks after his father's second abdication in 1815, aged only three. The backdrop of the Allies' capture of Paris made an anticlimactic end to his ascension--though he ruled from Austria the entire time while living with his mother. Later he was granted the title of Duke of Reichstadt and was appointed as a cadet in the Austrian army. His military career fascinated and caused apprehension among European leaders, who feared he may usurp the French throne later as an adult. Alas, this never came to be. He died in Vienna's Schönbrunn Palace at 21.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMERICANANTISLAVERYSOCIETY;Slavery's continued existence in the United States continues to face challenges from outspoken critics. The American Anti-Slavery Society, formed by abolitionist journalist William Lloyd Garrison, has grown out of these outcries and vows to do all it can for the abolitionist cause. They are officially pacifist, but its members have signed a pact to show their willingness to become martyrs if necessary. \n\nThe abolitionists know slavery's status quo is slowly crumbling. With the Supreme Court already having proclaimed states cannot nullify federal laws, it is only a matter of time until an abolitionist Congress or president gains power and nationally outlaws slavery. The Anti-Slavery Society wishes in the meantime to appeal to Americans' morals to convince them of slavery's atrocity and sinfulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWZEALANDINDEPENDENCE;The Maori people of New Zealand have codified their nationhood in a documet titled "He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni"--the New Zealand Declaration of Independence. Thirty-four chiefs drafted and signed the document, creating a "Confederation of United Tribes." They hope to solicit the British for protection against French claims to the island, while also doing away with extraterritoriality the British settlers on the island enjoy. \n\nThe Maori chiefs are thankful for the British crown's efforts to officialize their nationhood by desgining a national flag, allowing them to legally trade with ports in New South Wales and Norfolk Island. But they may be terribly naive as to how willing Britain is to respect the independence of a small island nation ripe for colonizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIXTHXHOSAWAR;Xhosa border conflicts rage on, with no end in sight, but today's raid on the Cape Colony by the chief Maqoma's army was particularly brutal.

The Cape government must mount a swift retaliation if we are to put these raids to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ARC_prov_gov_conservative;The Federal League;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEOFONCATIVO;Federalist forces commanded by Juan Facundo Quiroga departed from Mendoza in early January to invade Córdoba. Upon reaching Oncativo, about 25 miles outside the capital of Córdoba, they paused, waiting for reinforcements from La Rioja and Catamarca. In doing so, they allowed themselves to be caught by Unitarian forces led by General José María Paz, who had set out from Anisacate in mid-February. The Unitarian forces attacked in three columns, focusing on the left flank of the Federalists. After hard fighting, a Unitarian cavalry charge routed the Federalist cavalry, leaving their infantry exposed. Their position hopeless, the majority of the Federalist infantry surrendered, although general Juan Facundo Quiroga himself evaded capture. This Unitarian victory led the interior provinces of Catamarca, Córdoba, Jujuy, La Rioja, Mendoza, Salta, San Juan, San Luis, Santiago del Estero, and Tucumán to form the Unitarian League.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARIANLEAGUE;General José María Paz has declared the formation of the Unitarian League, or the League of the Interior, comprising the western provinces of La Plata. The leaders of these provinces seek to restore the unitarian form of government that existed previously under president Bernardino Rivadavia. Rivadavia's presidency had ended with his resignation when faced with revolts in several provinces. He was succeeded by Manuel Dorrego, who dissolved the constitution, returned autonomy to the provinces, and reconstituted the nation as a confederation. If the Unitarian League succeeds, La Plata will return to being a state with a strong central government. If it fails, the nation will remain an association of autonomous provinces ruled by a collection of caudillos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEDERALPACT;In response to the formation of the Unitarian League, representatives of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, Corrientes, and Buenos Aires met in 1830 to form an alliance between their provinces. And although disputes over international trade caused Corrientes to withdraw from the initial negotiations, the other three provinces formed the Federal Pact in early 1831. The agreement guaranteed free trade between the member provinces and promised mutual defense against invasions by other provinces, but otherwise each province remained mostly independent in how it handled its affairs. Thus, under the pact, La Plata remains a loose confederation and has no central government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARYLEAGUEWAR;A Federalist division, led by colonel Pacheco, has ambushed the Second Unitarian Cavalry, led by colonel Pedernera, and several Unitarian militia units at Fraile Muerto. During the fighting, a number of the Unitarian troops switched sides. Many of them had served previously under the Federalist Facundo Quiroga and were conscripted into the Unitarian army, and their sympathies remained with the Federalists. The Unitarian forces were soundly defeated, and some see Pacheco's victory as a sign that the tide may be turning against the Unitarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PAZCAPTURED;As the war turned against the Unitarians, General Paz himself led a reconnaissance mission in preparation for the defense of Córdoba. Unfortunately for him, Federalist troops were already in the region. Without even knowing that they were in danger, his party stumbled into a Federalist patrol and was captured. Pas is now imprisoned in Santa Fé by the order of General Estanislao López. Without his leadership, the Unitarian army has been disbanded, and their cause is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARIANISMREVIVED;With the Unitarian victory, the former constitution is restored, and La Plata will be united again. The days of its division into the personal holdings of powerful caudillos have ended; La Plata will have a single central government headed by a president. Now the attention of the government may safely be turned outwards, and some have designs on the territories that once fell under the former Spanish viceroyalty. Who can say what destiny has in store for La Plata.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

occupy_falklands_desc;We have maintained that we are the rightful owners of the Falkland Islands following the conclusion of the 1771 crisis with Spain. However, the islands have proven to be of little practical value, and we no longer maintain an active presence there. Starting in the mid 1820s, the Argentinian government has begun asserting that they are the rightful owners, even going so far as to establish a small colony there. And we have not intervened because we were unwilling to test the American Monroe doctrine. However, the Argentinian governor has blundered: He has angered the Americans and the U.S.S. Lexington has razed the Argentinian colony. We could easily reassert our sovereignty with a military expedition without angering the Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MALVINASSONBRITANICAS;The British government has unlawfully seized the Islas Malvinas from us. After our colony there had been destroyed by the Americans, they dispatched the H.M.S. Clio to take control of the islands. Although one of our own warships, the Sarandi, was present, its commander did not feel that he was in a position to resist the British troops. All he could do was protest when their marines landed and replaced our flag with the Union Jack. And, to cement their claims, the British have established a small naval base there.\n\nOur government sees this as a gratuitous exercise of "the right of the strongest," and we have lodged an official complaint to that effect with them. The Argentinian people are also incensed, and anti-British sentiments are found in every newspaper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Situated on a water channel called "Tarontho," between the Lakes Simcoe and Cachinching, and standing in the shadow of Lake Ontario, York makes for an ideal settlement and industrial hub. Thus, the colonial government has deemed it necessary today to incorporate York and its environs into a new city named after the Tarontho channel.

BLACKWAR;Ever since Europeans arrived on Australia, there has been conflict between the native Aboriginal peoples and the colonizers. The Black War, or the Tasmanian War as some call it, has plagued the island since 1803 when the first major settlements were established. The Aboriginal's skirmishes with the colonists more than doubled in intensity during the 1820s as a result of the settlers' continued attempts at killing the native people. Between 1826 and 1828 there were multiple major massacres resulting in the deaths of 408 Aboriginal Tasmanians and 61 British settlers. In 1830, lieutenant-governor George Arthur ordered 2,200 men, consisting of soldiers and free citizens, to persecute and forcibly relocate four out of the nine Aboriginal nations into a “reservation." The 31st of December 1831 officially marks the end of the Black War as the last resisting tribes whose numbers had dwindled to 28 people have surrendered after years of persecution and genocide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Authorities have squabbled over what should be the Costa Rican capital ever since its independence from Spain, but traditionally its provincial capital under Spanish rule had been the city of Cartago. After independence, however, the capital switched to San José, to some protest that prompted the federal government to create four equal-status capitals. This changed when the current head of state, Braulio Carrillo Colina, repealed the Ambulance Law, cementing San José as the sole Costa Rican capital. Paramilitaries of the four other former capitals--Cartago, Alajuela, and Heredia--have mobilized to force the law's re-enactment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TITHEWAR;Tithe payments are a tax imposed on farmers in Ireland. They pay 10 percent of the value of their agricultural produce to the clergy for the sake of financing the church. This has been a rather unpopular tax within the Catholic Irish communities, resulting in multiple clashes and protests. The "war" took a turn in 1831 when the Irish Constabulary fired on people resisting payments, killing 12 and wounding another 20. This event led anti-tithe protesters to ambush 40 Constabularies, killing 12, including the Chief Constabulary. Today, 200,000 people have gathered in Ballyhale in support of those being charged for the events that resulted in the 1831 killings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of his last acts was to dictate an open letter to Brazil: 'Slavery is an evil, and an attack against the rights and dignity of the human species, but its consequences are less harmful to those who suffer in captivity than to the Nation whose laws allow slavery. It is a cancer that devours its morality.' He will always be remembered for having ousted the tyrannical Dom Miguel I and having brought constitutionalism to Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINDELOLANDING;Liberal forces loyal to Dom Pedro have landed at Mindelo, seeking to overthrow his brother Dom Miguel, who has usurped the throne. With them, they have 60 ships and 7500 men, consisting of Constitutionalist forces loyal to Queen Maria II and her regent Dom Pedro, as well as a number of foreign volunteers. The landing caught the Absolutist forces by surprise, and Porto was captured swiftly thereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At 3 AM our forces launched another attack on the Miguelite army.

BATTLESTVINCENT;Our navy commanded by British naval officer and Vice Admiral of the Portuguese navy Charles Napier has today defeated the Miguelite navy off the coast of Cape St. Vincent! Even though the Constitutionalist fleet was outnumbered by the Miguelites, the battle proved to be a decisive victory for the Liberal side. A bold tactic of closing in- and boarding the numerically superior Miguelite ships, Napier managed to secure Constitutionalist naval supremacy, as well as capturing 4 ships of the line, 1 frigate, and 1 corvette. The result of this engagement means the siege of Porto has been broken, and full out war will break out imminently!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Miguelites responded by hastily gathering forces to stop the Constitutionalists from advancing and capturing the capital, resulting in a clash at Cova de Piedade. The Miguelites eventually get driven back into the Castle of Almada, which is captured by the Liberal forces a day later.

Our troops have been deployed to attack their position in three columns, commanded by Colonels Quierós, Nepomuceno and Vasconcelos, which were in turn led by Captain General António de Noronha who was responsible for the capture of Lisbon. The battle was a resounding success for our armies, resulting in Dom Miguel failing to rally his officers behind him for another battle.

LAGRANJA;Inspired by the 1830 French Revolution, exiled Spanish liberals have organized many unsuccessful military coups--known as pronunciamentos in Spanish--to re-establish the 1812 Constitution and end Fernando VII's absolute monarchy. The most notable of these was the pronunciamento of general José Torrijos, who ended up shot. The latest to occur was today, in the palace of La Granja, where King Fernando resides. On the 16th, Ferdinand's health took a turn for the worse, and he was expected to die at any moment. His wife, María Cristina, was then betrayed by the top brass in the army, who refused to acknowledge her regency. Thus, she influenced her husband to revoke the Pragmatic Sanction, preventing Carlos Isidro from ascending the throne. On the 18th, Fernando's father, Carlos IV, as regent annulled the Salic law of succession in the Spanish monarchy, attempting to make the royal line patrilineal. But today, unexpectedly, Ferdinand VII has recovered his health, dismissed ministers supporting Carlos's ascension, and repealed his father's decree, making Isabel the heir to the throne again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAGRANJAOPT;And they fail... again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1835TREATYOFLISBOA;Today an agreement between Portugal and Spain has been signed to guarantee both nations free navigation of the Douro River and the use of Porto and Fregeneda as customs ports, bringing prosperity to this sparsely inhabited area in the center of our nation.

TORRIJOSPRONOUNCEMENT;Liberals launched another pronunciamento today in Málaga, though it failed after its organizers fell into a trap set by our navy and the captain general of Andalusia. In May, the insurgent general José María Torrijos presented his plan for this insurrection, consisting of a "circumferential" penetration of the country to attack the center, Madrid, from various points. They would pick up liberal sympathizers along the way to encircle the capital, hoping their numbers would suffice to overwhelm the Spanish army. But first, they were to cross into Spanish territory from Gibraltar, with Torrijos leading them, to signal the uprising’s start. Málaga’s governor confided anonymously to Torrijos in September that the best place for the landing would be the coast of Málaga, where he would be assured of the support of local garrisons. On November 30th, two boats with sixty men headed by Torrijos left Gibraltar. They found their destination after forty hours of travel—however, they were met with gunfire from the docked Spanish ship Neptune, and the conspirators have now all been executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TORRIJOSPRONOUNCEMENTOPT;They will never win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRSTCARLISTWAR;Today, contingents of an ideology called "Carlism"--nicknamed after Fernando VII's brother and Spain's heir apparent, Carlos María Isidro--have taken up arms against the regency of María Cristina de Borbón. Catalonia, Aragon, Vasconia and Valencia run red with blood, and their populations, blinded by Carlism, are fighting for them. The Carlist uprisings are fueled by Fernando VII's death and the enactment of the Pragmatic Sanction, a liberal law to allow Isabel II to be the heir to the throne. For Isabel to take the throne instead of the megalomaniacal Carlos would mean a new era of prosperity for the nation. Viva Isabel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PRAGMATICSANCTION1830;Today, the Spanish government has published the contents of the 1789 Pragmatic Sanction, passed in that year unanimously by the court, which reinstates the traditional system of succession and abandons that which Felipe V introduced in 1713. From the year of its passing until now, the Sanction never would be revealed to the public and, therefore, had no legal validity. After the death of his third wife, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, King Fernando VII announced in September 1829 that he would marry again. He chose the Neapolitan princess María Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies as his bride, despite her being his niece and twenty-two years his younger. They married on December 10th that year. A few months later Fernando would declare the Pragmatic Sanction of 1789 fully in effect, ensuring that his eldest child—even if they were a girl—would succeed him. The decree has produced discontent among those would desire Carlos María Isidro, Fernando’s brother, to succeed to the throne—thus creating the Carlist movement. §RThis event decides whether you go carlist.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTICLERICALRIOTS1835;A series of riots against the clergy, inspired by the massacre of friars in Madrid produced a year ago, have begun to sow chaos in Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia. The violence is motivated by the clergy's support for Carlism and its work to suppress liberalism. By order of Valencia’s captain general, the archbishop of Barcelona left the country with a military escort and took refuge in Bordeaux, France. He escaped before being able to see the violence reach new heights of bloodshed, with no end in sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ROYALSTATUTE1834;Regent María Cristina de Borbón has issued a new Royal degree to overhaul Spain’s federal government. The decree introduces a bicameral legislature to Spain. It consists of the Estate of Próceres, whose members will be appointed by royalty and the high nobility, and an Estate of Solicitors, whose members will be elected by a vote of 16,000 people, less than 2% of the country's population. The decree clearly takes inspiration from the British parliamentary system. Being conservative in nature, the statute has pleased both reactionaries and conservatives, among them Carlists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After a reign of 25 years which began in 1808 when his father, Charles IV, abdicated, seeing the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of the viceroyalties, King Ferdinand VII has died today at the age of 49. Somewhat famous for inbreeding, the genetics of the Spanish house of Bourbon cursed Fernando to, despite having been married four times since 1802, have difficulty in having children. Indeed, his parents were cousins, his first marriage was to a cousin and his second and fourth marriages to nieces. Finally, in 1830, Isabel II was born and designated as his heir by the Pragmatic Sanction. However, as his brother, Carlos María Isidro de Borbón, has refused to accept Isabel II's legitimacy, his death has left a succession crisis behind—with one of the factions, the Carlists, already beginning to show signs of an impending rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRITISHSOCOTRA;The British have proposed a treaty to buy the island of Socotra as a coaling station for 30,000 pounds sterling.

With the former conservative Bermudists joining his cause against the liberal Orbegoso, Salaverry has taken control of most of Peru with little resistance. However, Orbegoso's main base of support in the liberal South has refused to recognize Salaverry's authority.

CHATOWAR;The region of Champa, in central and southern Vietnam, was reduced to the principalities of Panduranga and Kauthara on the eve of the 16th century. Kauthara was annexed by the Vietnamese halfway through the 17th century, and by now Panduranga has lost its hereditary monarchy status, with kings being appointed by the Vietnamese court in Hue. Panduranga officials have recently been supporting the rival faction of Le Van Duyet, in defiance of the Vietnamese suzerain. In response, Emperor Minh Mang has declared that the Cham king, Po Phaok The, ought to be arrested, and that Champa must be incorporated into the Vietnamese Empire for the king's treasonous behavior.

KATIPSUMAT;Recently, rumors have been brought to light that the Cham Muslim leader Katip Sumat has spent the early months of 1833 gathering his followers in a remote base in the countryside. Demanding from his followers "absolute loyalty to Allah and Islam," he had been preaching the Qur’an and disseminating Islamism, defending the establishment of an Islamist Vietnam and a jihad against the Nguyen dynasty. With their flags raised, and the words Po Rasak written upon them – meaning His Great Glorious Wonderful – a clear implication for either Allah or the prophet Muhammad, the rebels have just launched attacks against Vietnamese tax register centers and military garrisons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JATHAKWA;Following our suppression of Katip Sumat’s Islamist uprising in the summer of last year, the Cham people are once again acting against our rule, and it appears that they are being supported by the Montagnards. Attacking our provinces from Binh Tuan to Phu Yuen, reports reveal that Ja Thak Wa, a Cham Muslim cleric, is the leader of this revolt. It seems that his main interest is in proclaiming a new Champa dynasty, as he has announced that Po War Palei, the son-in-law of the last deputy ruler of the Champa, as the new King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHAMGENOCIDE;Minh Mang, Emperor of Vietnam, had dispatched over 3,000 troops to deal with the Cham rebels since the beginning of the uprisings in the region. The monarch had promised good remittances for soldiers who killed and beheaded rebels, and a wave of massacres and systematic killings took the Cham people by a storm. Slow slicing and rampant mass killings allowed the fury of Vietnamese troops to turn into a de facto ethnocide in Champa, with competitions between the Vietnamese royal troops and Kinh paramilitary units. By the summer of 1835, the Champa king, Po War Lei, was killed in action, and Ja Thak Wa was captured by Vietnamese troops and sentenced to death. Seven to twelve Cham villages were scrambled to the ground, and the murders and exile of other revolutionaries such as Po Phoak The, and the demolition of Cham temples, cemeteries and villages, signals the end of large-scale Cham revolts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GEORGEIVDED;His Majesty, George IV of the United Kingdom, has passed away today, in 1830. Born in 1762, crowned King in 1820, and dead in 1830, George was known for his absurd eating habits, his vast consumption of alcohol and his usage of laudanum to ease chronic pains. Weighing 280 pounds at his passing, George had arteriosclerosis, gout and suffered, like his father, from cataracts. The Scottish artist David Wilkie had remarked that the monarch looked like “a great sausage stuffed into the covering” due to his immense size. Having a rule marked by scandal due to his mistresses, his financial extravagance and a “selfish, unreliable and irresponsive” personality, George gradually grew ill due to his awful habits, with intensifying coughs at the time of his death. Clutching his stomach, the King died from an upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from the rupture of a blood vessel in his stomach. According to some versions, George’s last words were: “my boy [to his page], this is death”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

His life accomplishments during his reign include securing the continued existence of the University of Freiburg, and founding the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe which will go on to become the oldest technical school in Germany. Ludwig’s death means the extinction of his line in the Baden family. There has been much gossiping and rumor-fabrication surrounding his death, some saying that a mysterious 17 year old man named Kaspar Hauser who appeared in 1828 is the illegitimate son of Ludwig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LUDWIGHESSEDED;The Grand Duke Ludwig I of Hessen-Darmstadt has passed away at the age of 76. Succeeding his father, Ludwig IX, Ludwig I was elevated to Grand Duke of Hesse in 1806, due to allying Napoleon I, and joined the Confederation of the Rhine. During the Congress of Vienna, Ludwig would lose his Westphalian territories, but was compensated with the district of Rheinhessen.

The Baden Estates have come to a resolution to finally begin the abolition of this ancient practice, allowing for estates to forgo tithing in exchange for a compensatory pension equivalent to twenty times a tithe's appraised annual value, with twenty percent of this pension being supplied by a state tithe replacement fund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The parliament would also be granted more rights than in most other German states while limiting the Duke’s power and monetary budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYECHARLESBRUNSWICK;While Charles II of Brunswick technically reigned for 15 years, over half of it was through the prince-regent of Great Britain and Hanover. Charles was set to take the throne at the age of 19. However, when he turned 18, Hanover rushed through constitutional reforms that limited his powers, redefined his duchy, hereditary lands and due income. Charles ended his regency early, declaring in an edict that Hanover was a usurper and that the new constitution imposed by it was invalid because it limited his powers and went against all international norms of law, causing outrage in Hanover and England. The German Confederation attempted to intervene in the matter and ordered Charles to accept the new constitution, which he promptly disregarded, keeping Brunswick an absolute monarchy. This year, however, amidst the July Revolution, Charles' absolutism has been getting less popular in Brunswick, culminating in a large mob breaking into the palace to overthrow him, placing his brother William as Duke in his stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTTINGERREV;Liberal citizens of Göttingen started an armed uprising on the 8th of January with the goal of abolishing the feudal governing system. The uprising was quenched on the 16th of January, while the general state of the rest of Hanover remained calm. The reason for the uproar in Göttingen looks to be related to a widespread hatred for a specific book, written by Friedrich Wilhelm Boldewin von dem Knesebeck in praise of the nobility as a preserver of stability. Friedrich implied that stronger surveillance against liberal advocates was necessary, which seems to have been the cause of the recent troubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAX1830REV;1827 marked the death of King Friedrich August I, who was succeeded by King Anton. Anton has so far failed to enact any reforms throughout his 3 years of rule, but this has primarily been blamed on the cabinet minister Detlev von Einsiedel who remains the politically dominant figure within the Kingdom. In June, many of our subjects started outspokenly criticizing the current regime's lack of liberal reforms, primarily in Leipzig where the 300th anniversary of the Confessio Augustana of 1530 was being celebrated. Many felt the ban on wearing student uniforms- a symbol of liberalism- was a form of harassment, and have taken to the streets in protest. Local authorities dispatched police, which increased liberal resistance even further. After the July Revolution in France, protests have started to become more common, with the Leipzig protest repeating in September. From Leipzig, unrest has more recently begun spreading to other cities, such as Dresden. King Anton has now convened a security commission, seeking to deal with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The king would be head of the government, but could not become ruler of another state (save by blood inheritance) without consent of the Diet or parliament. The king's decrees have to be countersigned by at least one of his ministers, and without it, none of the king's acts could be considered valid. The king would have supreme power over religious matters, and could overrule any judgment delivered in court of law. The king has the power to promote laws, and without his consent no proposals for laws may be passed in the Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the revolt of the Greeks against our rule, we enlisted his help in crushing them in return for the promise of giving Egypt sovereignty over Crete, Cyprus and Morea. However, as the joint Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet intervened in the Battle of Navarino and sank the Egyptian navy, leading to our defeat in the war. Now, the scheming Muhammad Ali has declared war on us, using their lack of compensation for intervening in Greece as a casus belli, as he never received Crete, Cyprus or Morea. With his recent reforms of administration and army organization, his forces pose a legitimate threat to the levant. We must rally our forces and crush Egypt once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SAVOIEINVASION;Several Mazzinian exiles have attempted to overthrow King Vittorio Emmanuele I. They accused the Sovereign of consolidating central power for himself, giving life to an absolutism that would not have admitted opposition. The revolt involved an invasion of Savoy from the French border and direct action from infamous Italian republican Giuseppe Garibaldi, who would organize a revolt within the Kingdom’s fleet and meet them up with the invaders. \n\nBut the Piedmontese troops expected an invasion for some time, thanks to some information reports received beyond the border. In fact, leading insurgent general Girolamo Ramorino immediately realized the impossibility of the success of the plan, both the invasion of Savoy and Garibaldi's  mutiny. The rebellion’s failure led to some of its organizers, such as Ramorino and fellow general Giovanni Battista Scapaccino, to renounce their republican ideals and defect again to the monarchy. Garibaldi, meanwhile, has gone back into hiding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_title;The Kurhessische Verfassung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_desc;A new constitution modeled to some extent after that of England, has been supported by the Elector. This new constitution would establish a popular representation in a Diet or Congress of the provinces, and would extend liberty of speech and that of the press. The constitution would also seek to separate royal and state revenues, and make ministers swear an oath to the constitution, as well as implementing an impeachment system for ministers who break their oath. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_title;The Staatgrundgesetz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_desc;The Staatsgrundgesetz, a constitution proposed by the estates and supported by cabinet minister Caspar Detlev von Schulte would liberalize our monarchy to appease the left and prevent a repetition of the events of 1830. It would combine the Generalsteuerkasse with the Königliche Generalkasse to a singular Steuerkasse and give the power to set our country's budget to the estates. The city of Hannover's magistrates that the government currently appoints would be made independent with a simple government veto right to their appointment, giving the city more autonomy. More importantly, it would open the upper house of the estates to farmers and the middle class. While staunch conservatives oppose this constitution, it is clearly necessary to maintain the stability of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAPODISTRASDED;Ex-foreign minister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia - and first governor of Greece - Ioannis Kapodistrias, has just been murdered on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplion. His assassination was carried out by the disgruntled brother and son of one Petrobey Mavromichalis (a popular and successful leader in the uprising against Ottoman rule), whose imprisonment had been ordered by Kapodistrias. Konstantinos- Ioannis’ brother, and Ioannis’ son Georgios waited on the steps of the church, and killed Kapodistrias by stabbing him in the chest, and consecutively shooting him in the head. After the deed, Konstantis was shot by general Fotomaris, who witnessed the murder from his window. Georgios, however, had slipped away from the scene and would only surrender to authorities days later. He was subsequently put to death by firing squad, his last words being: “Peace Brothers!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Children through the ages 9-12 are limited to 48 hours of work per week, children under the age of 9 would not be allowed in factories (apart from silk mills), children under the age of 18 are not allowed to work at night, children through the ages 9-13 must not work more than 8 hours a day with an hour lunchbreak, children through the ages 14-18 must not work more than 12 hours with an hour lunchbreak. The Act would also establish a Factory Inspectorate, and allow for routine factory inspections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALAWITEREV;While having been relatively content with autonomous rule in the mountains of Latakia, the Alawis within our borders have started organizing an uprising at a scale we have yet to see. The cause of the recent unrest is partly due to the call for mass mobilization by Muhammad Ali, which upset the Alawites who remain loyal to the Ottomans. During a march of Egyptian soldiers from Aleppo to Latakia some 4,000 Alawi militants attacked the column, forcing the Egyptians to retreat to Latakia. The Alawite forces pursued, and laid siege to Latakia, causing much damage and monetary loss. We need to act now to return order to our rebellious provinces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PEASANTSPALESTINEREVOLT;Egypt's war effort against the Ottomans has led to extreme unrest in Palestine. To gather an army capable of marching to Constantinople, Ibrahim Pasha has ordered a fifth of all Muslims under Egyptian rule to be conscripted, including those in the now-conquered Levant. With this extensive draft has come high taxes that are draining the income of Levantine Arab peasants. These peasants, not owning land of their own, receive housing on the farms they tend to by their landlord and are meanwhile paid a subsistence wage that cannot survive high taxing.\n\nWith these factors contributing to huge unrest, the Palestinian sheikh Qasim al-Ahmad has ordered his followers to disobey the Egyptian draft orders and refuse to pay these taxes. Peasants and nobles alike have declared an open revolt, storming cities such as Hebron, Nablus, and Safed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPANISHCHOLERA;It's been nine months since cholera hit France, and our authorities knew it was only a matter of time before it came to Spain as well. Over the past month, cholera was reported in Vigo, Galicia, which now hosts the majority of cases in all the country. The outbreak initially was caused by the landing of auxiliary troops in Portugal, where the War of Portuguese Succession still rages on. Almost instantly another outbreak emerged in Barcelona. But cases are spreading most widely in the south, where thousands of deaths have occurred. The plague is bringing winds of rebellion to the population, who resent the government's poor response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ODAALAPATRIA;A poem in Catalan entitled 'La Pàtria,' or 'The Homeland' in English, by Carles Aribau, has been published recently.

It tells of the longing for an independent Catalonia and exalts the Catalan language--a clear threat to the unity of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANKFURTERWACHENSTURM;There is a specter haunting Germany--that of liberalism--and its effects are becoming more and more visible. Today, fifty students stormed Frankfurt's Hauptwache and Konstablerwache police offices, attempting to gain access to the German Confederacy's treasury. This, in turn, would enable them to hold the Confederacy's leadership hostage and force the German states' unification. The police summarily apprehended the perpetrators. Eight of them, however, escaped to the United States. \n\nIt remains to be seen how much more influence these revolutionaries' circles will gain in Germany. One of the groups participating in the attack, the Burschenschaft, will not rest until Germany becomes a single political entity for the first time in over a millennium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RESTORERSARGQUOTEUNQUOTE;Following their victory in the civil war, the federalist movement in Buenos Aires split into two factions: the doctrinarios, moderates who favored constitutionalism, and apostólicos, who supported a Rosas dictatorship. After Rosas's first term of office ended in 1832, Juan Ramón Balcarce, a doctrinario, was elected governor. Balcarce found himself in constant conflict with the apostólicos, eventually becoming so frustrated with them that he filed charges against one of their newspapers. Unfortunately for Balcarce, the title "The Restorer of the Laws" was also what people called Rosas, and the public assumed that Balcarce was attempting to try Rosas in his absence. Rosas's wife, Encarnación Ezcurra, helped organize a public uprising, the Revolution of the Restorers, that was joined by forces returning from the south as well as some of the very troops ordered to put it down. Having no way to resist the uprising, the legislature removed Balcarce from power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

KRAKOWCONSTITUTION1833;The involvement of Krakow in the Polish rising of 1830 did not go unpunished. The status of Krakow as a free state, and its constitution, were a product of the Congress of Vienna. As such, Austria, Prussia, and Russia felt free to revise that constitution as they saw fit, and so they empowered the Reorganization Commission to create a new constitution that would make the city more controllable. This new constitution made the Board of Residents, a body consisting of a representative from each of the neighboring powers, Krakow's highest authority, with the senate subservient to it, effectively ending what little political independence the free city formerly had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MUNCHENGRATZCONFERENCESUCCEEDS;The Münchengrätz Convention has concluded with promising results: Austria, Prussia, and Russia have signed a treaty agreeing to work together to preserve the Ottomans' stability and remain diplomatically close. Our Holy Alliance has been revived! The main text of the agreement commits the parties to jointly defend the independence and existence of the Ottoman Empire. There is also a second, secret, article in which Austria and Russia agree to jointly establish a new order in the Levant should the Ottoman Empire fall. Relations with the West have soured, however, as the tsar has prohibited the publication of the convention at all, which has only deepened British and French concerns about Russian plans for the Ottoman Empire, as some speculate that they have agreed to partition it with Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SOSHANGANEREKT;Disaster has struck our settlement in Lourenço Marques. The prosperous slave trading port has long been our center of control over the southern coast of Mozambique and central hub of the commerce taking place in nearby trading posts. The initial calamity was Zulu King Dingane kaSenzangakhona's recent sudden attack on the settlement. A large portion of the garrison fled the fort along with governor Dionísio António Ribeiro who was later hunted down and killed. The remaining token force surrendered to the invaders without a fight, leaving the Zulu to plunder Lourenço Marques. After the Zulus returned to their lands in the South, a new force arrived from the North: The Gaza Kingdom under Soshangane.

NOONGARMASSACRE;The Binjarebs, a Nyungar tribe, have clashed with Western Australian colonists since the colony's foundation in 1829, when thousands of settlers began fencing off land and hunting the native wild-life, causing food shortages for the Aboriginal people. These clashes culminated in the colony's Governor, James Stirling, leading a detachment of 25 soldiers, police, and settlers to attack the Binjarebs. Over the next hour they shot and killed between 15 and 80 Nyungar men, women and children. The police superintendent was speared and later died.

TILIMSANINCIDENT;When we first marched into the city of Tilimsan, our Wadiya troops were warmly welcomed by the populace and Sultan Abd al-Rahman's rule was swiftly recognized in the surrounding areas. His nephew, the 15 year-old Moulay Ali ben Slimane, was then pronounced Khalifa of the city. Since then, however, numerous problems have arisen. Moulay Ali has allowed local rivalries to continue unchecked, while his Wadiya troops pillage the countryside instead of taking the citadel of Tlemcen, which is still manned by troops loyal to the former Bey of Algeria. Due to the Khalifa's mismanagement, the Wadiya have become increasingly insubordinate and destructive, increasingly turning the locals against us. This has lead to multiple massacres, mostly of Koloughlis and other inhabitants of Turkish descent, which once ruled the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TILIMSANPROTECT;Following the fall of Algiers, the Bey of Algeria has lost authority, resulting in a chaotic power vacuum further fuelled by fears of French expansion. Thus, the inhabitants of Tilimsan have organized a deputation to ask Sultan Abd al-Rahman to accept their oath of allegiance, establishing his rule over the city. While accepting the offer would expand our domains and protect the city, it may eventually bring us into conflict with France. Additionally, due to the Bey of Algeria's nominal subservience to the Sublime Porte, the Ottomans will not be pleased. In any case, the Wadiya, our influential northeastern regional army, are ready to march to the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WADIYAREVOLT;As a result of the Wadiya's withdrawal from Tilimsan some months ago, the Wadiya, military tribes which defend the borders of the state and provide regular contingents to the army, have revolted all around the countryside, from Hasaymatu to Agadir, and recognized a relative of the sultan, Mohammed bin al-Tayyib, as sultan. Fez is under siege, and the sultan has escaped to Meknes with the al-Bukhari, corps of black-African slaves and Haratin slave-soldiers, only loyal to the sultan. We should stop this rebellion and crack down on the Wadaya!\n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRATLEMCEN;After we seized the city of Algiers, causing the Bey of Algeria to go into exile, a power vacuum ensued in the city of Tlemcen, resulting in the populace requesting protection from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. Thus, despite having been part of Algeria for centuries, the city has been under Moroccan administration since 1830. Our advisors have suggested forcing the Sultan to turn over the city to us, as it is an important port which would be of great strategic value in the conquest of Algeria's interior. When faced with our might, Morocco should readily back down and abandon the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MORTLEMCEN;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent us a delegation demanding the immediate withdrawal of our forces from the city of Tilimsan that we had taken control of following the collapse of the Bey of Algeria's authority in 1830.

EVTDESC00001;Rafael Maroto was a renowned Spanish General in the American Wars of Independence, and a distinct royalist in his loyalties, pledging himself to Don Carlos after resigning from military command in 1833 and being imprisoned by the liberal government for six months. In following years he proved to be a loyal commander, albeit one that remained at great odds with the conduct of Carlist forces, leading to defeats due to infighting and court intrigue. A decree proclaiming him a traitor responsible for the deaths of several high ranking officials in the early conflict was issued to Don Carlos. Only a short time later, with the complete non-compliance of the Carlist armed forces surrounding Maroto was this decree ultimately reneged. Maroto has stated: 'I have triumphed over the arbitrariness, injustice, and blindness of a prince. History will judge me in due course.' This is a huge humiliation to Carlism and has lead to the formation of a Marotist party within our ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00016;The Fueros Debate - Carlos of Molina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00016;The issue of the Fueros is one of great contention amongst the peoples of the Kingdom of Spain, and the root of the divide between the Carlists and the Christinos. While the Christinos sought the devolution and assimilation of the fueros into the Spanish crown, the root of the Carlist movement seeks to protect the regional legal systems and minority rights indicative of the fueros system. With the success of Carlos V in asserting his claim to the Spanish throne, the issue of the Fueros has been put aside, for now, and the fueros will maintain their autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00017;The Fueros Debate - Carlos VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00017;With the ascension of a new monarch to the Spanish throne comes a renewal of the fueros debate in the Spanish nation. A traditionalist at heart, much like his predecessor, he seeks to elevate the fueros and bring them to par with the rest of the Spanish country. To accomplish this, a legal reform program has been pushed forwards by the crown to achieve this end. It has proven more than popular amongst the catalan and basque peoples, but has itself become a controversy in the Castilian portion of the kingdom. The reform package seeks to modernize and codify the fueros further in Spanish law, trimming their long list of priveleges of unnecessary and archaic legal structures, while solidifying their status and rendering them all but immutable in the Spanish crown. As such, this reform will greatly increase the militancy of liberals across the kingdom who seek the abolishment of the fueros outright, while rendering the fueros themselves more efficient in their governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00017;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00017;There is no need to reform them now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00018;Carlos VI's Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00018;With the first stage of the reform package set through, the king's full ambition is becoming apparent - a total reform of the monarchial structure of Spain, integrating the fueros as an established legal structure throughout the Spanish nation, and codifying their existence as integral to Spain. To accomplish this, each Fuero will be reorganized into separate crownlands, held as a personal demesne of the king, but fully integrated under the crown of Spain. This places the Basque, Catalan, and Galician regions under direct Carlist rule, irrespective of the legislature in Madrid. In turn, trade restrictions and customs borders will be devolved between the crownlands and the rest of the country, whereas the rights of Catalans and Basques to organize their own military and govern their own lands remain intact indefinitely. In effect, this reform package sees a potential solution to the Fueros debate altogether, but will further anger the liberals, perhaps to the point of revolution. The reform scheme is held as overly ambitious even among some Carlists. §RWill result in a revolt§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00019;It has been no secret that Carlos VI's reforms have been of immense controversy in the past few weeks, particularly among the people centering around Madrid, many of whom have flocked to the liberal Christino banners in reaction to what they perceive as a betrayal of Spanish interests in the interest of minorities that they see as rightfully subservient. This unrest has hit a recent high pitch with an attempted assassination of the king as he was on a street parade in Madrid. A gunman attempted to fire upon him, only narrowly missing before police dispatched and disarmed the man. It appears that even within the heartland of Spain, the king does not remain safe. This does not bode well for if the reforms are expanded upon, as he plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00019;The fires of revolution are stoked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00020;The Flames of Liberalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00020;Carlos VI has been nothing short of controversial since before he ever ascended the throne, as could be said for any Spanish monarchs in this time. While conservatives and traditionalists find the Carlist cause to be a banner to flock to, a realm of continued stability in the face of the tumultuous reform and change of the French and Portuguese, and a beacon for restored Spanish prestige in a modern age, the liberals see it as a counterrevolutionary reaction, an outdated regime of a bygone era. With the passage of the reform package championed by the king, this has exploded into open revolt across the Castilian countryside in reaction. While the unpopularity of these measures was already known, it has quickly become apparent that the reaction is far more dangerous than anticipated, especially as the calls of these locals have turned from not just declarations against the Carlists, but to declarations against the Spanish monarchy altogether. With the fires of this revolution stoked, it seems likely that a revolution has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00020;The banners of war beckon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00021;Carlos VI Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00021;Carlos VI has emerged triumphant in the face of the liberal opposition to his reforms, and yes, to his rule. His power greatly expanded in the face of the Liberal defeat, he has been granted full power to enact his rule over all of Spain, and indeed, to not only expand his reforms to the whole of the country, but to undo what reforms the Liberals had until that point forced onto the government. His power made absolute, Carlos has found bearing to solidify his reign in a manner more comprehensive than even the Ancien Regime, a truly modern monarchy led benevolently by his rule, at least in the minds of some. Liberals chafe under his rule, but it will be unlikely that they will pose a significant threat again in this lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00021;The Kingdom of Spain stands strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00022;The Liberal Triumph;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00022;In the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, the Carlist usurpers have been driven from the throne of Spain, and in their place a liberal republic has been proclaimed, ready to bring about a restoration of liberty to the Iberian peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00022;The Republic has been victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00023;The Fueros Debate - Juan III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00023;With the ascension of Juan III to the Spanish throne, the Fueros debate has regrettably taken up public discourse once again. As Carlos VI failed to bring any lasting change to the Fueros situation, the debate now falls into the hands of the current king to push forwards his vision for what shall be done. Unlike prior Carlist claimants, however, his views have controversially followed along with those of the Christinos in many regards, and as such he views the Fueros as a wholly outdated relic of a feudal past, not worth reforming, but rather total abolishment. To reach these ends, he is pushing forwards a reform program to increase the efficiency of the Fueros, substantially limiting their autonomy and reducing their legal protections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00023;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00023;No need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00024;Juan III's Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00024;With the initial passing of Juan III's reforms, it has quickly become clear that his actions have awoken a vehement response from the Basque and Catalan minorities of the kingdom. The threatening of their long-held privelegia is widely viewed as a direct violation of their cultural identities, and evidence of unrightful Castilian oppression of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula. To continue with these reforms will no doubt result in a falling-out with the Basque and Catalan minorities altogether, opening a rift that may well never close again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00024;Their opposition means little. Abolish the Fueros.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00024;Enough with this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00025;Unrest in Catalonia and the Basque Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00025;With the recent reform package passed by Juan III, in preparation to completely abolish the fueros, a riot has broken out in the city of Barcelona in response to this perceived betrayal by the Spanish monarchy that has sworn to uphold the rights and interests of the fueros since its onset, and has now begun reducing the rights of these communities in a matter irrespective of this pledge. The riot bodes ill for the fate of relations between the Spanish and the Catalans and Basques, should the reforms continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00025;Can't they just Basque in the glory of Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00026;The Rise of Catalan and Basque Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00026;With the abolishing of the fueros, the protections for the minorities of Spain have been abolished by the central government, placing them fully under the authority of Madrid's wishes, irrespective of what these groups desire for themselves. In response, the idea of nationhood has arisen among these populations, who now see Spain as an oppressive foreign entity, and not representative of their national identities, which are now viewed as fundamentally separate from that of Spain itself. It is doubtful that this rift can ever be closed again in this current era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00026;So it will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00027;The Fueros Debate - Carlos VII;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00027;On the ascension of Carlos VII, the fueros debate has come up once again, and quite possibly for the last time in this era of history. By this point the Fueros have become, even in Victorian standards, highly established in society at large. Carlos VII is a Carlist in the most traditional sense, viewing the Fueros as an integral part of Spanish society, and indeed, not well-respected enough. As such, he seeks to not only preserve, but expand the privelegia of the fueros into full-scale autonomy and confederalism, devolving Spanish control into a mere rubber stamp for their own, largely independent actions. To accomplish this, the king has pressed forwards a reform program to steadily begin increasing their autonomy in local affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00027;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00027;MORE autonomy? No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00028;Carlos VII's Solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00028;With the increased autonomy granted to the fueros by the first reforms, Carlos VII has pressed forwards a reform program to finally evolve the Fueros system into the modern era. His scheme, a highly controversial plan, involves restoring the crown of Aragon onto the European world stage in its entirety, effectively devolving the Spanish crown once again into its composite states of Castille and Aragon. This concession, a full-scale recognition of Catalan and Aragonese statehood, can never be undone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00028;True freedom at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00028;This is unnecessary. The Fueros will remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00036;The Resolution of the Fueros Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00036;With one of several potential solutions finally pushed forwards, regardless of the consequences, the Fueros Debate has finally been resolved. With this accomplished, the debate has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00036;Finally, peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00037;The Papacy Under Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00037;In the height of Spanish supremacy in western Europe, it maintained itself as the predominant defender of Catholic interests across the European continent, a sentiment that the traditionalist Carlists share greatly. In the wake of Italian unification, the Holy See has found itself greatly reduced, and indeed all but completely removed from the landscape of European politics. While Italy assures Europe that the religious authority of the Pope has in no way been diminished, this nationalistic order exists at potentially great detriment to the moral and traditional fabric of society, and must be dealt with swiftly if it is to be rectified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00037;We must act immediately! §RGain 5 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00037;Who cares about the Pope?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00038;The Ecclesiastical War - Spanish Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00038;As the guns settle in the Mediterranean, the Carlist forces have come out as clearly triumphant in the struggle over the soul of Catholic Europe. As such, we now have the option of dictating terms from a favorable position. Should we so choose, we can simply restore the Pope to his distinguished position on the peninsula, though this has been criticized as a far from permanent solution, as Italy could simply recover it later. Alternatively, we could enforce the Pope as the de facto head of the Italian nation itself, whilst claiming the islands of Sardinia and Sicily to ensure that this treaty can be enforced. Still more particularly militaristic advisors suggest that Italy be partitioned in its entirety, with the Pope being placed in charge of all his traditional holdings, whilst we ourselves lay claim to the rest of the peninsula in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00039;Spanish Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00039;With the conclusion of the Spanish intervention in the Italian peninsula, we have been forced out of the city of Rome altogether, and our nation has been split in two. With our nation no longer properly united, and Rome back under Papal rule, we must now choose a new capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA00042;We take what is owed us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00043;The Sacrilege Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00043;In the 1820s, under a royaliste supermajority, the Sacrilege laws were passed, rendering the acts of blasphemy and sacrilege illegal, under penalty of anything from forced labor to death. This highly controversial law has rarely been enforced, but has remained a prominent source of criticism against the highly religious government in Paris. This controversy has recently been reignited with the case of a known liberal agitator, an atheist, who has stolen several items from the local diocese, defaced them, then later returned them in a form of protest against the government. According to the law, he is meant to be executed, although this will undoubtedly anger the liberal population. To refuse to enforce the law in this case will in turn undermine its legitimacy. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00043;Enforce the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00043;Let it slide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00044;Intervention in Belgium?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00044;In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, France was forced to cede the region of Belgium to the Netherlands, in order to turn the latter into a proper balancing power against potentially renewed French expansionism. These culturally French and religiously Catholic lands quickly began to chafe under Dutch rule, and have now risen in revolt against their prior overlords. With their control quickly slipping, the opportunity has come for us to make an offer: we restore order to Belgium, and in return Wallonia is returned to French rule, while Flanders is restored to the Netherlands, a deal the beleaguered Dutch are quite likely to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00044;Send the offer. §RGain 5 infamy§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00044;Wallonia is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00045;Intervention in Belgium?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00045;In the midst of our catastrophic civil war, an offer has come by the French, opportunistically seeking the return of its lost Belgian territories. Should we accept this offer, the French will doubtlessly restore order to the lost provinces, but it will come at a great cost, that of Wallonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00045;We have little choice, accept the French offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00045;The cost is too high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00046;The Dutch Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA00046;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00047;The Dutch Refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00049;Instability of the Bourbon Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00049;Despite the great unpopularity of the Bourbon monarchy, it has managed to weather the storm of public opinion, and has secured itself in place as a rightful continuation of the Ancien Regime before it. However, despite this, the liberal sect of the populace remains at great odds with the royalist powers that be, and this does not portend the end of instability within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00049;We will endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00050;Succession of Louis XIX;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00050;The late Charles X's health has been declining rapidly as of late, and with his old age it has become apparent that his end is nigh. As such, it has been decided that Charles X will abdicate in his dying days, leaving the throne to his heir presumptive, who will become known as Louis XIX. His legacy is one of both restoration and rot, the restoration of the old traditions and beliefs of France, but the rot of the very same liberties that the French people attained in the Revolution, his opposition to liberal reforms being the hallmark of his reign. Nevertheless, he will rest with his fathers before him, a king of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00050;Long live the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00051;The Death of Louis XIX;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00051;After just a short eight years of rule, Louis XIX has been found dead in his quarters. A man of military stature, he was at the forefront of anti-Bonapartiste sentiment in France, and was a major spearhead of the Bourbon restoration in France when he landed in Bourdeaux, and subsequently led Royaliste forces under the king for many years, even intervening in Spain during its own tumultuous fight against liberal elements. Now, however, after such a short reign, and in the midst of ever-increasing liberal agitation, he leaves his throne to Henri V.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00051;May his reign last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00056;The Land Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00056;In the years following the Bourbon Restoration, fears have spiked amongst peasants that noble elites' old feudal privileges will be restored, and the rights granted to the people by the French Revolution will be done away with by the Ancien Regime. In recent months this fear has appeared to become quite justified, as a controversy rocks the kingdom regarding a legal dispute between a petty nobleman and a small collective of businessmen over a territory they bought, albeit from peasants confiscated it from the nobleman during the Revolution. The nobleman demanded that the land be returned to him, as well as the profits of the unlawful sale, citing his rightful ownership of the land. The courts, staffed with royalist sympathizers, quickly ruled in favor of the nobleman. This event has become a fiasco, not just as other noblemen similarly deprived of land and status have begun making demands of a similar caliber, but as liberals have become increasingly agitated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00056;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00057;Nobility in the Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00057;Up until recently, France has been reliant on a military structure inherited from the days of the Bonaparte usurpation, promoted via merit rather than social status, and a conscription system that allows for a much larger military than the purely standing armies of days gone past. However, these reforms have come at a great cost to the political stability of the French realm, as many of the officers are no longer loyal to the king, and most have their loyalties placed with the Bonapartes they were hired from. This has caused for the French realm a situation wherein the keys to maintaining government power are largely placed in the hands of those that do not want to see the current government in power to begin with. The current administration has therefore suggested a series of reforms, seeking to dissolve the levy en masse altogether, and initiate a purge of Bonapartiste sympathizers in the military staff. This will undoubtedly weaken the military unduly, but may well save the throne from future insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00057;This is ludicrous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00057;A brilliant plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00058;Republican Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00058;The army's loyalties have been held in question for a long time now, and now it has come to pass that these fears be proven justified. A Republican sect of the army has committed mutiny, and now is poised to seize control of the French countryside in the south of the country. While loyalist support in the military flocks north to regroup around Paris, this portends a civil war that could well cripple the French state for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00058;For the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00059;Coup Attempt thwarted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00059;The army's loyalties have been held in question for some time, even after the reforms passed by the late Louis XIX to reorganize their structure to better benefit the crown. As of recent, those fears have largely been put to rest, as a planned Republican coup was swiftly foiled by the royal army, having discovered the traitorous plot before it could be enacted. With renewed faith in the armed forces, the station of the Bourbon monarchy is finally secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00059;Long Live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00060;Bourbon Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00060;With the guns finally going silent across continental France, it has become clear now that the Bourbon realm will be one to last. It has survived the liberal onslaught and the Ancien Regime remains intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00060;Vive la Bourbon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00061;Republican Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00061;As the guns go silent across continental France, the last faction standing has shown itself to be that of the French Republic. Liberalism has finally triumphed, and the Ancien Regime is no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00061;Vive La France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00062;The Arpitan Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00062;One place that the Bourbons have not expected to see resistance is the region of Arpitania, bordering the Swiss Commonwealth. Yet, as of late, liberal rebels have seized control of a decent part of the countryside, rebelling in the name of a so-called 'Arpitan Republic', under the hopes of joining Switzerland. These odd demands have left the government baffled, yet we have little choice but to put down this uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00062;Put down the uprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00062;For Liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00064;Securing France;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00064;With the liberals soundly defeated in France, the Bourbon realm has found itself secure in its position, free to solve its internal disputes however it sees fit. First on the drawing board is how to deal with the liberal rot that has infested the French crown since the first rioters hit the streets in the Revolution. While the most radical of the Legitimiste supporters in the realm see fit to wholly do away with all liberalized reform and bring back the Ancien Regime in full, other more moderate parties see this as a surefire way to simply cause another such crisis again in the future, and hope to chase a more moderate approach, seeing as how the revolution cannot so easily be undone. Still, some others find it fit to seek complete reconciliation with the liberals of the realm, and remodel the Bourbon monarchy into a truly modern, liberalizing force that the French people can surely back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00066;As the years have worn on after the purge of the upper staff, followed by extensive investment into the armed forces and modernization of its structure, the upper staff has finally recovered from the purges instituted in years past, and furthermore has become a well-maintained core staff akin to the Prussian model.

EVTNAME00075;German Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00075;The Bourbon realm, always fearing for its continued security, has a unique opportunity in front of it. Prussia and Austria are both coming to blows in Central Europe, and France plays a key role in the region that could decisively shift the balance of power in its favor. The Bourbons, always keen to back a conservative party of interest in Europe to secure its own throne, will place forth an offer to the victorious NGF that it will not intervene in any attempt to form a united German state, and in return, the Germans will not violate its rule over the important Alsace-Lorraine.

EVTNAME00086;The Declaration of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00086;In the aftermath of the Bourbon Empire's declaration, the geopolitical situation in Europe has rapidly altered its course in response. Fears of a Franco-Spanish domineering force across the European continent has spurred on a fearful response unseen since the days of Napoleon Bonaparte himself. The brazen violation of the treaty of Utrecht has not gone unnoticed, and the beginnings of an international coalition have come into being. A declaration has been issued from the powers, meeting in Prague, declaring the state of the Bourbon Empire to be an illegitimate construct of a state and an existential threat to peace in Europe. It is expected that within a year, the empires of Europe will make their move. Whether we weather the storm or not will determine if the Bourbon Empire has a future in the world to begin with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00086;We will weather the storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00087;The Second War of Spanish Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00087;The powers of Europe have now made their move, in hopes of putting an end to the personal union between Spain and France. With little room for error and little chance of leniency should the French nation fail to assert itself for a third time in recent memory, the result of this war will determine the fate of both realms, perhaps for the rest of the century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00087;The storm has arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00088;The Coalition of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00088;As per the Declaration of Prague we are an interested party to the dismantling of the Bourbon Empire. It is in our best interest to take part in this war, though we can always choose to back out if it is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00088;We will go to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00088;We will back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00089;The Peace of Lubeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00089;Despite our best efforts, the realm of the Bourbon Empire has been beaten and broken by the vast efforts of the coalition levied against it. In the aftermath of the war, the Empire has been forced to split into its constituent parts, neither of which permitted to house the House de Bourbon any longer, but rather emplaced under responsible governments set up by the victors to ensure this situation never occurs again. The Empire is broken, and will likely never rise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00089;We have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00116;Integrating Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00116;Ever since the Polish Partition, the Poles have long languished under foreign rule, including our own. However, whilst the Prussians and Russians have oppressed Poles to a great degree, the Austrian Empire has given to them a relatively light burden, compared to the struggles they face elsewhere. With the conquest of Poland complete, the kingdom can be integrated into the empire wholesale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00116;Dissolve Galicia, Integrate Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00117;The Greek Revolution - Total Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00117;The unthinkable has happened. Despite our best efforts, the Greek revolution has achieved even its most ludicrous goals, beating us back time and time again across the Balkan provinces and throwing our empire into utter chaos. With the leadership of the empire crumbling outright, we have been forced to come to terms with the upstarts, ceding the whole of our Greek balkan provinces and the Anatolian coastline to the upstart rebels, and ceding the rest of our disconnected holdings either to independent states or to the very same Greeks. Our empire has reached a low unseen ever before, and this humiliation will not be soon forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00117;We have been ruined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00118;The Basileia tos Rhomaion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00118;With the success of the revolution being far more than nigh any could have predicted, the beginnings of what can only be the finest hour in Rhomaion history are at hand. While the government may not yet be formed, only a provisional government under various bickering revolutionary leaders present, and the constitution is as of yet a greatly new concept, the ecstatic Greek citizens have already taken to calling the newly independent state the 'Basileia tos Rhomaion,' the new Roman Empire. With the city of Constantinople in Greek hands, and the Aegaean sea controlled on both sides by the meteorically rising state, there is little reason to not accept this title as it stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00118;Long live the true Romans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00119;An empire...of rot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00119;While the Greek people may yet call this the true Basileia tos Rhomaion, the Roman Empire, the state inherited by the revolution is anything but the glorious empire it claims pretense to. Despite the victory of the revolution, state control over the vast territory of land inherited from the Ottoman sultanate is loose at best, roaming bands of Turkish and Albanian irregulars still roaming the countryside and raiding Greek settlements, the bureaucracy is greatly strained, the political leadership of the nation is dominated by infighting, and a great deal of officials have questionable loyalties at best to the security of the Rhomaion state. It may yet be an empire, but it has a long way to go to being a true successor to the thrones of old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00119;Oh the misery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00129;The Provisional Rhomaion Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00129;The Rhomaion state is currently in the midst of a tenuous provisional government, headed by Andreas Zaimis, a conservative appointed as the head of the government as an interrim leader until the revolution could be successful. With the revolution successful, and international mediation having failed, the crisis of power can be delayed no longer. There are many leaders, with many differing interests for what the Greek state should be. There is Theodoros Kolokotronis, the head of the Russian faction of government, and a firm advocate for a strong Rhomaion monarchy backed by the Tsar, there is Alexandros Mavrokordatos, the former writer of the Hellene constitution, but criticized for structuring it around his own power and influence, Yannis Makriyannis, a moderate liberal and firm advocate of constitutionalism, Petrobey Mavromachalis, a natural local leader whose family has kept the Ottomans back for a long time, and Nikitaras, known as the Turk Eater for his fervent and principled war effort against the Ottoman Sultan. Whomever is chosen as the successor by Zaimis will determine the fate of the Rhomaion state for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTD00129;Nikitaras, the Turk Eater;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE00129;Mavromichalis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00121;The Agenda of Kolokotronis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00121;Kolokotronis has emerged from the initial bout of succession as the emergent power in domestic Rhomaion affairs. A firm and devout supporter of the Russian faction of politics, the Rhomaion state is expected to lean heavily into the Russian Tsardom's sphere of influence under his guidance. Furthermore, it is highly likely that he will seek to instate a Russian prince as monarch of the empire. It is doubtless that in time the English and French factions of politics will come to find great disagreement in the leadership of the realm, but that matters little.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00121;Got it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00122;A Russian Monarch?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00122;It is no secret that with Kolokotronis in charge, the Russian faction of Rhomaion politics has sway in the highest branches of government, and the power to enact great change in this crucial time for development in the state. As such, it was inevitable that they use their majority to appoint a Russian prince, the Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, as king of the Rhomaion state, forming it from a mere republic into a true kingdom, supported by its natural and ancient ally in Russia to the north. While this will surely displease many constitutionalists and liberals, these sentiments will undoubtedly fall to the wayside in the face of a true monarch's benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00122;Long live the Roman Tsar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00123;The Opposition of Mavrokordatos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00123;Mavrokordatos, the writer who put to pen the first Greek constitution, has increasingly come to blows with the current Rhomaion state government from his power base in the western reaches of the country. Having built the bureaucracy of the state around himself, it has proven difficult to dislodge him from his support base in the west without bringing about a second civil war in the country. Should we choose to leave him be, he will continue to prove a nuisance to Rhomaion state affairs for quite some time, but should we take this to a military conclusion, it is inevitable that the result be a renewal of armed hostilities in the western reaches of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00123;Let him be, he does little harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00123;Put this insurrectionist in his place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00124;Nicholas the Wastrel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00124;Nicholas, the great king of the Rhomaion state, has unfortunately begun to prove himself as less than great in practice as a monarch. While his ascention has all but guaranteed continued friendship with the Russian Tsardom, it has quickly become apparent that Nicholas was never properly trained to rule this newly independent state through these turbulent opening years. A chronic wastrel, he has taken to rampant spending and partying instead of ruling the empire he was handed, and instead of using his own estate, he has also taken to using up state funds to do so. To add further insult to injury, he has proven himself greatly interested in military affairs, forcing military reorganization to make himself the head of the Rhomaion armed forces, and already the former military leadership of the revolution has found his leadership distinctly lacking, and unfortunately too stubborn to placate. His continued rule may well prove to be disastrous for the people of the Rhomaion state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00124;Please, God, have mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00125;The Slavic Mandate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00125;Despite the great many failings of the Russian monarch ruling over the Rhomaion state, one great boon has been brought to light in recent times. With a Russian orthodox monarch at the helm of the kingdom, the character of the nation has been made such that integration of Slavic peoples in the realm will be far smoother and easier than it would otherwise be, as fears of Rhomaion domination of their communities would be greatly unfounded when the state is itself run by a Slavophile royal house. This has proven to dissuade independence movements and even encourage integration amongst the Slavic peoples of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00125;Perhaps there is a light in the tunnel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00126;Nicholas the Bastard;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00126;Yet more controversy has arisen regarding the king of the Rhomaion state, as it has come to light that the king has long been engaged in an affair with a mistress, and has remained indiscreet with this affair, leading to a public breakup with his wife, Alexanda Petrovina of Oldenburg, and the discovery of multiple bastard sires in this affair. His hopes had been to ultimately divorce his own wife in favor of this mistress, but these hopes have been dashed in light of the affair being discovered and brought to the public, and the refusal of his wife to grant the divorce he seeks in order to remarry the mistress he sought. This has brought great humiliation to the state and to foreign dignitaries representing the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00126;The wastrel is a shame to us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00127;Nicholas the Mad;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00127;In recent days, the behavior of the king has grown increasingly erratic, particularly following the death of his mistress, Catherine Chislova. His hopes to marry her have in recent months been dashed, as his wife, who long refused a divorce that would render this affair a potentially legal marriage, has now proven herself to outlive this very same mistress. Perhaps from grief, perhaps from a long hidden madness kept hidden from public, or perhaps from the oral cancer he suffers now having spread to his brain, the king has become a mad ruler, attacking the courtiers in his palace like a wild beast, spending far more lavishly than ever before, and growing ever more erratic on the daily. His rule has now become more disastrous than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00127;Save us from his madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00128;The Internment of Nicholas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00128;As the madness of Nicholas has grown ever more apparent to the governing bodies of state, so too has the need to remove him from office become a necessity for the survival of the state. With his son, the presumptive heir in Nicholas the Younger, heading the movement to depose him, it would seem his rule has come to an inglorious end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00128;The madness has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00200;The Restoration of Etrutia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00200;The Kingdom of Etruria was a short-lived kingdom in the Italian peninsula, created by Napoleon I as a form of compensation to the Spanish line of Bourbon-Parma, and ultimately dissolved in 1815. With our success in overturning this aspect of the congress of Vienna, the kingdom can be restored, securing further Bourbon gains in the Italian peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00201;The Treaty of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00201;The belligerent Sardinian kingdom has been defeated on the battlefield definitively, putting an end to their expansionist ambitions in the Italian peninsula. To ensure the continued security of both Austria and France, the state is to be effectively dismantled, its kingdom split in twain, French majority regions handed back to the kingdom of France, and the Sardinian military curtailed for years to come, preventing it from ever posing a threat again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00201;This will undoubtedly bring stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00204;The Carlist War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00204;The Liberals in Spain have defied our prior enforcement of the absolutist rule of the Bourbon line and brought about a pragmatic sanction to cement their own rule over our neighbor, denying Carlos the right to his rule. Catalans and Basque have rallied behind him to dispute this unlawful succession, and while we may stand by and do nothing, many in our administration advocate immediate intervention to secure a long term ally...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00204;How many times do we need to teach you this lesson, old man?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00204;We have enough problems already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00205;French Intervention victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00205;The unlawful Christinos have been deposed and French forces once again march triumphantly throughout Spain, bearing the banner of the French crown alongside the Burgundian Cross of Spain. Now, the question remains of how to administer our ally, whether to trust them to rule alone or to take more direct responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00205;The crown is restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00205;Keep Spain under surveillance. §RGain 15 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00205;Keep Spain controlled, and seize Cuba. §RGain 20 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00206;French Intervention defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00206;We have successfully repulsed even the French from our lands, preventing another repeat of the Bourbon tyranny within our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00206;Viva España!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00208;Distributism in Cuba;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00208;Distributist measures taken in the Spanish mainland have thus far proven quite successful, prompting some in the more abolitionist camp of government to propose expanding the program well beyond the shores of Spain proper, and to extend it to the colonial holdings of Cuba and Puerto Rico as well. To do so would cost a great investment from the Spanish coffers, but could prove invaluable to recovering the island possessions' respective economies in the aftermath of abolition by handing landed estates to freed slaves and to those peninsulares whom have yet to benefit on the mainland. However, this will doubtlessly earn further ire from former slaveholders on the islands, and may yet prove another challenge for Spanish authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00208;What a brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00208;Who cares about the islands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
