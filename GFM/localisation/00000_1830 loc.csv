schomburgk_line_title;The Schomburgk Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgk_line_desc;Following the dissolution of Gran Colombia, its unsettled and remote eastern frontier in Essequibo has been left unorganized and unprotected. Following our acquisition of Guyana from the Dutch, we inherited a territorial dispute over Essequibo with Gran Colombia which disputed the former Spanish treaty. Thus we have legal justification to seize this patch of jungle without conflict. The Royal Geographical Society of London recommends we send Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk to explore the region and delineate a proper border with Venezuela, as his work on surveying the Virgin Island of Anegada was quite impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgkexplained;Abusing flimsy claims of inheritance of responsibilites from treaties between Spain and the Dutch, Great Britain has occupied Essequibo. With our recently nascent country barely posessing an army of note, there is nothing we can do to resist the Brits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORDEATH;After resigning from the presidency, Bolívar made his way to Cartagena de Indias to board a ship and settle down abroad. However, he rested in the Customs House of Santa Marta as his health made travel difficult. As his condition worsened, he needed a transfer to a quieter place and moved to a farm located in San Pedro Alejandrino on the outskirts of the city, where he entered the full care of his trusted family doctor. Initially optimistic, both he and his doctor eventually recognized the severity of the condition, leading to Bolívar writing his will and instructing his entourage how to proceed in the event of his death. \nAfter the passage of morning marked by an increasing decline of vital signs, the silence of the house's main hall, occupied by the aides, military leadership of the Patriot Army and Bolívar's closest friends, was interrupted by the words of his doctor inviting them to the next room to witness the great liberator's last moments. Surrounded by his entourage, and after a long but calm agony, Simón Bolívar died at 1 PM, 3 minutes and 55 seconds on Friday, December 17, 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORSLASTWORDS;'Colombians: You have witnessed my efforts to raise freedom where tyranny once reigned. I have worked with selflessness, abandoning my fortune and even my tranquility. I separated from command when I was persuaded that you distrusted my detachment. My enemies abused your credulity and they trampled on what is most sacred to me, my reputation and my love of freedom. I have been a victim of my persecutors, who have led me to the doors of the tomb. I forgive them. As I disappear from your midst, my affection tells me that I must make a manifestato of my last wishes. I do not aspire to any other glory than the consolidation of Colombia. All of you must work for the inestimable good of the Union: The people obeying the government to be free from anarchy, the ministers of the sanctuary directing their prayers to heaven, and the military using their sword to preserve the peace. Colombians! My last wishes are for the happiness of the country. If my death contributes to the end of the parties and the consolidation of the Union, I shall go to the grave in peace.'   -Simón Bolívar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_title;The Apulo Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_desc;Gran Colombia is doomed. Without Bolívar, no force is strong enough to hold it together. With Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama in open revolt, Perhaps it would be better to face the facts and abandon the dream rather than spill more blood. President Rafael Urdaneta cannot handle the situation and has called for a convention to put an end to Gran Colombia and create a new state with a new constitution to consolidate what remains of our once great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORRESIGNS;Since 1828, Simón Bolívar has attempted to keep Gran Colombia together by assuming dictatorial powers to deal with the emergencies at hand. He has finally seen that this course of action has kept the union together but divided it ever more severely. He has now arrived at the conclusion that it would be best for Gran Colombia if he, El Libertador, resigned and left the presidency to a less divisive person. This however creates ever more uncertainty. Gran Colombia has always had Bolívar at its helm, what will happen now that he has left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES;Led by traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence following the example of Venezuela and Ecuador. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived unlike those in Venezuela and Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSECEDES;Informed of the secession of Venezuela and Bolívar's death, the assembly of the district of the South has declared independence, founding the state of Ecuador. The departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are now under the supreme rule of Juan Jose Flores, the head of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASECEDES;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of hero of the wars against Spain, General José Antonio Páez who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata that occurred between 1826 and 1829. While the assembly's rhetoric was anti-Bolivarian from the start, once it had been informed of Bolívar's death, it took a turn for a worse. The assembly ultimately ceremoniously announced its independence from Gran Colombia as the state of Venezuela under the leadership of General Páez himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAQUESTION;General Tomás Herrera has lead a counterrevolt against Juan Eligio Alzuru to put an end to Panamanian independence and repatriate to Colombia. While his revolt is seeing a lot of success, he needs the support of the people. The question lies in their loyalty to Colombia. Will they work towards continued self-sovereignty or reintegration to Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS;Executed by General Tomás Hererra, Alzuru's revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope the same may occur in Venezuela or Ecuador, but those hopes are clearly in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It establishes the seperation of powers, the responsibilities of public officials, the duty to protect the catholic church and the unitary form of government with decentralized local assemblies. Furthermore, it divides congress into an upper and lower house and sets its legislative terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADMIRABLECONGRESS;Simón Bolívar's years as dictator of Gran Colombia have done the union no good. His unquestioned reign has even been compared by many to that of the kings of Spain. Recognizing what is best for the union, he has called for a new constitutional assembly to create a constitution for Gran Colombia in a last-ditch effort to prevent its dissolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE;After much trial and tribulation, Gran Colombia is united once more. El Libertador can rest easy knowing that the Bolivarian legacy shall continue. However, now that the crisis of secession is averted, we must ask ourselves what lies in our future. How will we govern ourselves to ensure that Gran Colombia will survive and not collapse once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERTHYRRISING;Some days ago riots started in the town of Merthyr Tydfil, north of Cardiff, and today there are already reports of it expanding into all Wales, being an all-out rebellion. It's the first time a red flag is seen in a workers' revolt, being a symbol of the workers. They protest against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment, and among the shouts were cries of "Caws a bara" (cheese and bread), "Annibyniaeth" (independence) and "I lawr gyda'r Brenin" (down with the king), being a clear threat to the monarchy. Do we give them more rights or we protect the monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWYORKSECONDFIRE;On a night in 1835, a fire broke out in a five-story warehouse at 25 Merchant Street, at the intersection of Hanover Street. As it spread, gale-force winds blowing from the northwest towards the East River spread the fire. It could be seen from Philadelphia, approximately 80 miles away. At the time of the fire, major water sources were frozen in temperatures as low as -17°F, forcing the firefighters to drill holes to access liquid water, which later refroze around the houses and pipes. Efforts were made to deprive the fire of fuel by demolishing surrounding buildings, but there was insufficient gunpowder. Later in the next evening, a detachment of U.S. Marines returned with gunpowder and stopped the fire. During the day and a half that it burned, the fire killed 2 civilians and in total destroyed 660 buildings, resulting in property damage estimated between 20-25 million.

EVTDESC127854;3 days ago Nat Turner, an enslaved African-American preacher, had organizad a rebellion of enslaved and free Black people in Southampton County, Virginia. Turner was recorded as "Nat" by Benjamin Turner, the man who enslaved him and his family. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, under then-current laws which made slavery legal, Nat was inherited as property by Benjamin's son Samuel Turner. On February 12, 1831, he witnessed a solar eclipse that was visible from much of the southeastern United States, and was convinced that it was the sign for which he was waiting. He began preparations for an uprising against the enslavers in Southampton County by purchasing muskets. The last 3 days they have been waging terror in Southampton, but have been stopped today by local militias and detachments of men from the USS Natchez and USS Warren. Approximately 120 black people died today, and around 60 white people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC127855;Turner eluded capture for six weeks, but remained in Southampton County. On October 30, a White farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people, in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. While awaiting trial, Turner confessed his knowledge of the rebellion to attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray, who compiled what he claimed was Turner's confession. Today he got sentenced to death and hanged for "conspiring to rebel and making insurrection".;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16051840;In the rural town of Uster, Zürich canton, locals gathered today in a peaceful assembly to protest the overrepresentation of the cantonal capital compared to Zürich's rural parts. They argue that Uster's livelihood has been neglected, causing its locals to languish in poverty and remain largely uneducated. They also call for a new constitution to overhaul the governance of all Switzerland's cantons. For citizens to call for the constitution's repeal or amendment is unheard of: they are legally prohibited from petitioning the government to make such changes. Neverless, the liberal ideas left behind by Napoleon's rule clearly are still showing their influence. This will definitely not be the last call by our people for fair representation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051841;Never before have our people made such strong demands against our government while also not shedding a drop of blood. Today, discontent locals in the Freiamt region of Aargau canton led an uprising in protest of reduced rural representation in the constitution. They demonstrated their resolve by organizing themselves into militias. Despite clashes across Freiamt where about 6,000 total militia members confronted Swiss forces--with both sides prepared to engage--not a single shot was fired. Miraculously, the government agreed to a revision to the constitution and negotiated an end to the uprising. This marks an indelible end to the illiberal, undemocratic government before Napoleon's time, where the government could get away with unequal or unfair representation of the people. Aargau was ruled particularly heavy-handedly by governor Johannes Herzog, who has been claimed to want to run a duchy instead of a canton. Well, his tyranny ends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When they arrived, the beys were greeted by a military procession--but the next thing they knew, upon a hand signal from Mehmed, the Turkish soldiers opened fire on the beys and killed them all. \n\nThe Ottomans have removed the one element in the government we could count on to stop our full annexation. Lest we let our dream of an independent Albania die out, we must rally our people and declare a war for our liberation against the Ottomans--right now.

CONCEPCIONEARTHQUAKE;A devastating earthquake has hit Concepción and nearby Talcahuano today at 11:30 AM. The quake combined with a resulting tsunami have left Concepción destroyed, with most buildings in ruins. Miraculously, though, casualties have remained low, with only 50 people reported dead. The lack of deaths is attributable to how the quake was slow to intensify and happened at about high noon, allowing locals to get to safety in time. Charles Darwin happened to be in Concepción as the earthquake struck, on a stop for the second voyage of the HMS Beagle. He would describe the quake as such: "I happened to be on shore, and was lying down in the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly, and lasted two minutes, but the time appeared much longer. The rocking of the ground was very sensible . . . The people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm. It is these accompaniments that create that perfect horror of earthquakes, experienced by all who have thus seen, as well as felt, their effects.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The barrage killed 18 people but only minorly wounded Louis-Philippe, and Fieschi was immediately captured. \n\nIt has since then been discovered that four barrels of the volley gun did not fire due to the components' failure. Surely more would have died, including the King, had the weapon worked as intended. Fieschi is imprisoned and awaiting trial, while Pépin and Morey are still at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But now, we have gone a bridge too far for the Ottomans--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of the Emirate of Bohtan, which is a Turk vassal. This can only end badly. . .;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZAKHOISBOHTAN;The Emirate of Soran was established in 1399 and subjugated by us in 1554. It stayed our peacable vassal for several centuries until the ambitious Mir Mohammed proclaimed himself "Emir Mansur"--an independent ruler. He has since then expanded his army and begun waging war on neighboring principalities, hoping for Soran to become the dominant Kurdish tribe. But now, he has gone a bridge too far--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of our vassal the Emirate of Bohtan. Something must be done to stop Soran's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

soran_je_ottoman_desc;While the Emirate of Soran has been driven back, the Emir still poses a threat to the region's stability. Letting his rule continue despite his rebellious actions may inspire other Kurdish chiefs to do the same. While the last expedition retook Soran's conquests but had to turn back shortly before the capital, Rewanduz, due to bad wheather, this second attack is sure to put an end to the dangerous Emir once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

fund_french_settlement_in_algeria_desc;Although our New World colonies are gone, our settler-colonial ventures are not yet over, still going strong in Algeria. But more often than not, these settlers will need a considerable amount of funding to ensure their livelihood in the new land. Thus, as the mother nation, it is seen as our duty to provide for their needs. The question is how much money we shall offer them, if at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGADEADAF;With our newfound victory over the Algerians, we must continue the fight against the tribesmen who are holding out, rallying in the hinterland against colonial rule. Hussein Bey, the former ruler of Algeria has fled to his strongholds in the East surrounding Constantine, as the populace has lost all confidence in his rule due to his defeat. In this power vacuum, a new figure has emerged: Abdelkader ibn Muhieddine, a minor sharif and islamic scholar has rallied the tribes to resist us in unison. We know, however that such backwards, unorganized rabble cannot stop us! Soon, all of Algeria shall be ours! Vive la France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCETROLLED;France has pathetically attempted to conquer our great nation, and they have failed, as they had failed in Egypt in 1800, Haiti in 1804, and Russia in 1812. It is time to choose to either move forward as an independent nation or reapproach the Ottoman Empire for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANDOURENA;It is time to decide our policy of on the new settlers in Algeria and what they shall recive from the French state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUZCUOGLUREVOLTS;A rebellion has risen within the Sanjak of Lazistan, resisting the installment of derebeys--local governors--who are cruel and care most about consolidating Ottoman control. This comes as a result of a blood feud between the Hazinedaroglu and Tuzcuoglu families, both of whom have vied for control of Lazistan as derebeys. Derebey Adjara Osman Hazinedaroglu has used his authority to levy large taxes on his subjects, which contributed to food scarcity in 1829 and 1830. Locals have now begun to stop paying taxes and rebel, with rival Derebey Tahir Aga Tuzcuoglu as their leader. We cannot allow Tuzcuoglu to continue his defiance. We must put an end to the rabble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUZCUOGLUCRUSHED;Lazistan has been pacified and plundered by our army. With the Tuzcuoglu family removed from power, we can tighten our grip on the province and ensure its governors will be unconditionally loyal to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

uruguay_const_1830_desc;Inspired by the liberal ideas of the American and French revolutionaries, calls for a constitution firmly establishing Uruguay as a representative democracy are echoing within the government. Under this constitution, Uruguay will be represented by a president and a two-chamber legislative branch consisting of the Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Senators. Meanwhile, supreme legal power will be put in the hands of the Supreme Court of Justice. The constitution will also strengthen the federal government's authority--so much so that our country will be considered a unitary republic. Nevertheless, the constitution's passing will be a firm, welcomed step in the direction toward equality and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_title;The Anglo-Ashanti Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_desc;Border conflicts with the Ashanti Empire have been a constant occurrence since we first established our colony on the Gold Coast. With it obvious, though, that the Ashanti cannot fully repel our troops and retake that land, perhaps we should send them an ultimatum. We shall force an agreement that our borders will lie on the opposite banks of the Pra River, the natural boundary of the Gold Coast colony. Of course, there's nothing stopping us from eventually breaking this treaty and conquering them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051835;Border conflicts with the British are continuing with no end in sight, lest one of us falls entirely or agrees to peace terms. Britain has come to us with an ultimatum: that we recognize their sovereignty over the Gold Coast colony and share a natural border along the Pra River. This will put us at peace for the meantime and, unfortunately, leave our brethren on the coast at Britain's whim. But war is tiring, and we've certainly had our share of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051836;The Ashanti have accepted our peace offer. We can lay down our arms and rest assured that the next time we go to war with them, they will stand no chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051837;Our peace offer to the Ashanti Empire is dead in the water. If we ever felt guilt over killing these poor tribespeople--well, think back to how they turned Colonel Governor McCarthy's skull into a gold-plated drinking cup. Now we can look forward to drinking wine aplenty from their skulls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romania_semiconst_1831_title;The Regulamentul Organic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romania_semiconst_1831_desc;While the Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moladvia are Ottoman vassals, we have retained garrisons in them since the war of 1828-29. The populace is becoming increasingly resentful of this, especially as we have confiscated Wallachia and Moldavia's treasuries for the time being. It is up to us to shape their governments for the better and hand them back control over their finances. The proposed Organic Regulation would form the organic law, or legal system forming the basis of government, of the principalities. It would establish a national assembly in Iasi and Bucharest elected by no more than 3000 of the most influential citizens. Furthermore, the Organic Regulation would, among other things, ensure the independence of the judiciary and establish a poll tax in place of the old indirect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REGULAMENTULORGANIC;Russia has imposed a legal system forming the basis of government on us:  the so-called Regulamentul Organic, or "Organic Regulation." This semi-constitutional document returns to us the Russian-confiscated treasury, establishes a national assembly elected by the three thousand most influential citizens, ensures the independence of the judiciary and replaces the old indirect taxes with a poll tax among many other reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REFORMISTREVOLUTION;The government of José María Vargas has become opposed by a growing movement for the restoration of Gran Colombia. The rebels are led by heroes of the war of independence, including Santiago Mariño, Diego Ibarra and José Laurencio Silva, all formerly loyalists to the bolivarian cause. They have rallied their forces in the city of Maracaibo and begun marching East to take Caracas. Now, in turn, José Antonio Páez, the man who split Venezuela from Gran Colombia and spelled its doom has returned from retirement and assembled militia to join the struggle on the government's side. It seems that the old rivalry between proponents and detractors of Gran Colombia is to play out one final time--on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_title;The Peruvian Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_desc;Now that the Bermudists have been defeated, we can finally set about finishing the new constitution. The proposed draft mostly reiterates the 1828 constitution and follows its liberal spirit but makes some adjustments to combat instability which has been experienced since. For example, the post of vice-president would be removed due to the bad contact of former VP Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente. Another example is the prohibition of immediate presidential reelection, a tactic used by Augustín Gamarra to elongate his presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCONGRESSPRU;The 1828 Constitution had agreed that in 1833, five years later, a new constitution would be formulated to adapt to the new situation of our country and possibly implement a federal system. Thus, a constitutional congress has gathered and heald a vote to elect a provisional president until the new constitution is finished. Pretenders for the position were the liberal Luis José de Obregoso, the conservative Pedro Pablo Bermúdez and the independent Domingo Nieto. Obregoso won with 47 votes to Bermúdez's 36 and Nieto's 1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCIVILWAR;Pedro Pablo Bermúdez has rejected the result of the constitutional convention's election of José de Obregoso and risen up in revolt, beginning a civil war. While Bermúdez enjoys the support of most of the army, the populace of Lima and Arequipa are on the side of Obregoso, forcing Bermudist troops to retreat from the cities, unable to capture them with the adamant opposition of the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

belgium_const_1831_desc;Belgium's existence is extraordinary, considering how divided along linguistic and cultural lines our two major ethnic groups are. Nevertheless, it is our duty to consolidate our brand-new nation, uniting the Flemish, the Walloons and the small German minority. We shall create a constitutional monarchy, a compromise between liberals and the conservatives. The state will have three branches of government and afford privileges to the Catholic Church. Basic freedoms such as that of expression, worship, and the press will be guaranteed. However, only landed subjects will be able to vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANANTHEM;La Brabançonne, the song that has become a rallying cry and source of Belgian nationalism, was not, in fact, been written by a Belgian. A French mercenary serving in Brussels, known by the alias Jenneval, composed the original poem the song is based on before dying in action. The title refers to inhabitants of the region of Brabant, where Brussels is located. The poem originally scolded rioters during the revolution and claimed the Dutch Prince of Orange would be the "example of kings" and "father of Belgians" if he granted Belgium independence. However, following the bombardment of Antwerp, he wrote a second version condemning the Dutch for their brutality. An arrangement with the second version's lyrics, set by François van Campenhout to the tune of "L'Air des lancers polonais" ("Song of the Polish Lancers"), has immediately gained popularity among our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKING;Although our constitution declares us a constitutional monarchy, as of yet we lack a monarch. Three options have been debated: Firstly, the Duke of Nemours, son of revolutionary king Louis-Philippe of France. Secondly, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a member of the British royal house. Thirdly, a minor noble. The French candidate, while ensuring French protection would surely be concerning to the UK and Prussia who would see it as an increase in revolutionary influence in Europe. On the other hand, the British candidate would probably have some strings attached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRANCE;Belgium has sent us an emissary to propose the coronation of the Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe as king of Belgium. While this would give us much influence over Belgium, it would surely attract the ire of the British and Prussians. Additionally, Belgium's industry, which is larger than ours, would, by increased interaction with our economy, hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRBEL;King Louis-Philippe has given the go-ahead to the coronation of the Duke of Nemours. Celebrations have begun amid his arrival in Brussels. Belgium finally has a king, and a popular one at that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSABONKFR;The Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe of France, has been crowned king of Belgium at the bequest of the provisional government. This act spreads the influence of the French revolution further throughout Europe and endangers the old order. With the Louis-Philippe's son on the throne, Belgium is now a French protectorate in all but name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNO;Louis-Philippe has refused to let his son become king of France. The reason he gives for this is twofold: On the one hand, he does not wish to raise the ire of the other European powers, specifically Prussia and the UK, by extending his influence. On the other hand, Belgium's industry far outmatches France's and economic intermingling between the two would hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGBRIISH;Belgium has sent us an emissary proposing the coronation of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as their king. While it would definitely increase our influence on Belgium, we would get mixed up in their ongoing conflict with the Dutch. An agreement called the "Treaty of the Eighteen Articles" has been proposed which would agree to the coronation of Leopold under the condition that the matters of Limburg and Luxembourg are for Britain to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNOBLE;The British have outright refused to let Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha become our king, wanting to have nothing to do with our revolutionary state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BELGIUMINDEPENDENCE;Rebel leaders have formed a provisional government to cooperate and organize the revolt into a formidable united force. Today, they have finally declared the independence of "Belgium," a Catholic state encompassing Luxembourg, Wallonia, Flanders and Limburg. All these lands are, aside from a few forts still held by our troops, in the hands of the rebels. They have already begun reaching out to other European powers in pursuit of recognition. After the disaster in the September Days, our army is in too much disarray to fight. Our only option is biding our time and invading once we have built up our strength and licked our wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEPTEMBERDAYS;A force of 12,000 soldiers under the leadership of Prince Frederick marched into Brussels, determined to restore order. Yet they were completely unprepared for the challenge they faced: seemingly every inhabitant is on the side of the rebellion. The soldiers were embattled from all sides and constantly under fire. The raw ferocity and determination of the populace brought the organized army to its knees, unable to hold in face of such opposition. After four days of fighting, they were routed and fled North in disarray. This humiliating defeat has solidified the rebels' position and cast doubt on whether we shall ever be able to retake the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRUSSELSRIOTS;Tensions have long been rising in our Catholic southern provinces due to grievances, including but not limited to the following: underrepresentation of Catholics in the General Assembly, the south having to pay for the larger debt of the north, Protestant domination of government ministries, and inadequate freedoms of press and assembly. With news of the successful recent revolution in France, the situation has escalated. A large group of opera-goers began rioting in the streets after attending The Mute Girl of Portici, a sentimental and patriotic opera set during an Italian 17th-century uprising against Spanish rule. Droves of inhabitants joined the mob, which proceeded to storm government offices. Now, a day later, the mayhem has only worsened, spreading across the south and driving our forces into retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANENG;France has proposed that we partition Belgium instead of recognizing it. We would receive Ghent and Antwerp, while France would get Wallonia and Brussels, Prussia would be given Luxemburg and Liège, and the Dutch would receive Limburg and Hasselt. Antwerp's port would be the most likely to be used to launch an invasion of our isles with its large, close port. Thus, its control would be immensely beneficial to our defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The king we have in mind is Purandar Singha, a prince of the Ahom Kingdom. Under our plan, he will be installed as a ruler in Upper Assam, guaranteeing our undisputed dominance in the region without directly governing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;

OHWELLDUTCHNVASION;The Dutch have crossed into Antwerp province, ready to engage our forces and crush our noble revolution. As of now, they are advancing into the forests around Ravels, and Zondereigen has been taken at the cost of 400 Belgian troops being repelled. These troops are clearly better trained and equipped than our own, and their leadership includes the Prince of Orange himself, eager to see his kingdom's reunification through by any means. We must not resign to possible defeat. Our future lies in our own hands, not the House of Orange's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OHWELLDUTCHNVASIONFRA;The separatist Kingdom of Belgium requests our support in fighting off the Dutch for independence. Helping them is tempting, as it weakens the Netherlands and allows us to possibly place a new country on our border under our thumbs.

spanish_inquisition_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! The Tribune of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, commonly called the Spanish Inquisition, is the police force responsible for enforcing strict observance of Catholicism in the Spanish Empire. Established at the end of the Reconquista, it oversaw the mass conversion and expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain, and since then it has been responsible for enforcing the consolidation of the Spanish crown's rule by ensuring Catholicism unites its disparate subjects. But the Inquisition is not what it used to be. It was temporarily abolished under Joseph Bonaparte's reign and was reinstated by Ferdinand VII in 1814. Liberalism continues to weaken the Inquisition's strength to eradicate Christian heteroodoxy. The organization has been reduced to a censorship committee, rarely overseeing prosecutions anymore. Perhaps it is time to disband the Inquisition and bury its legacy in the sand dunes of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

july_ordinances_title;The July Ordinances;;;;;;;;;;;;;
july_ordinances_desc;Liberalism is a scourge upon the monarchy. It must be put down through a heavy-handed approach to ruling France's subjects, lest we fail to save the French people from their naive ideas of how they wish to be governed. Chief Minister Jules Armand de Polignac, an ultraroyalist who has long been targeted by the liberals, proposes a set of royal ordinances meant to reign France in: they include limitation of press freedom, a newly appointed set of reactionary Councillors of State, the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, and the exclusion of the middle class from future elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEIZUREOFLENATIONAL;In response to the July Ordinances' restrictions on press freedom, staff writers at the liberal newspaper Le National published a petition demanding restoration of their rights. Agents of the prince de Polignac then promptly raided the journal's offices. Le National originated as a liberal mouthpiece in light of de Polignac's rise to power, patronized by liberal officials such as the prince of Talleyrand and the duke of Broglie. The paper's existence proves a thorn in the state's backside. We maintain that the government acted fully in its authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JULYREVOLUTION;The Bourbon monarchy is no longer in France as of today. After the surge of reactionary behavior under Chief Minister de Polignac--who was narrowly re-elected after having been voted out in a motion of no confidence--the French people were ignited to relaunch a revolution in the spirit of the first. De Polignac foolishly attempted to singlehandedly alter France's constitution by passing the draconian July Ordinances, attempting to create a newly authoritarian monarchy. Rioting and looting has dragged on for three days, until the people finally captured the Hôtel de Ville in Paris and declared a provisional government, after wholly defeating the last of the royalists' forces. A new monarchy is expected to emerge with Louis Philippe of Orléans, a former Republican general, as king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOUISPHILLIPETROLLS;France's new king has taken the throne: Louis Philippe of Orléans. As duke of Chartres and a former general of the Revolutionary Wars, he served with distinction but later broke with the revolutionaries after they decided to kill King Louis XVI. He later exiled himself to Switzerland in 1793 after it was discovered he was conspiring to restore the monarchy. \n\nCharles X had named Louis Philippe his lieutenant general, though he not-so-secretly held ambitions to succeed Charles as king. Already popular among the masses, the Chamber of Deputies has appointed Louis Philippe I as the first in the Orléans dynasty--hopefully marking a return to the center-right policies of Napoleon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After the funeral of former army commander and anti-monarchist Jean Maximilien Lamarque, riots emerged as citizens sympathetic to his beliefs attempted to make their opinions against the government heard. Attacks against our forces were swift and well-organized, carried out by secret societies such as the infamous Society of the Rights of Men, whose members stockpile weapons as if building an army. Their fighters were reinforced by disaffected Parisien youth and refugees from Germany, Poland, and Italy, each of whom were being pursued by their respective governments for participating in republican activism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

VENDEEETCHOUANNERIE;Legitimist sentiment is rising in the departement of the Vendée, within Brittany. Legitimists pledge allegiance to the House of Orléans as the rightful heir to the monarchy, and are willing to attack French forces to see the installment of an Orléans dynasty through. Charles X, who was exiled to Scotland following the July Revolution, has given up on reclaiming the throne. It has thus been concluded that his daughter-in-law, Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Siciles, must be orchestrating the unrest, for she has been promoting her young son Henri's claim to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIESTARTS;The struggle against the Legitimist rebels in the Vendée has escalated to open combat. Troops must now rally to engage the rabble! Legitimist generals like Louis de Bourmont and Charles de Beaumont d'Autichamp who left France when king Louis Philippe took the throne have returned to spearhead the revolt. But however good its generals may be, the rebellion is comprised of the very conservative rural populace of the region who have little to no experience in combat. Additionally, the rebels lack guns and ammunition which they had hoped to get in the form of foreign support of which there is none forthcoming. \n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEBOR;The Legitimist revolution is a success. France now has a new king: Henri of Orléans, former Duke of Chambourd. Henri was not in the line of succession for the throne under the current Bourbon dynasty, though his mother, Marie-Caroline, Duchess of Berry, resented his exclusion. This is because Henri's birth to his two members of the Bourbon-Two Sicilies house created a perfect line of descendence from King Louis XVI, the first French Bourbon monarch. Thus, Marie-Caroline considers Henri the rightful king and herself regent. She collaborated with Legitimist militants to install her son--and the results now speak for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEFRA;The Duchess of Berry has been connected to the now-defeated Legitimist insurrection in the Vendée. Having resented her son Henri's not being in the line of succession on the French throne, she collaborated with militants to see Henri installed. Her resentment is driven by how Henri is directly descended from King Louis XVI, and also has a mother from his same royal house. Because of this, some legitimists see Henri as the rightful king, after the abdications of Charles X and Louis Antoine. \n\nThe Duchess was arrested today and will remain incarcerated for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These lands are the homes of indigenous tribes such as the Mapuche and Ranqueles, whom we experience friction with due to frequent border raids on our territories by them. The campaign has several front lines, spanning from the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes. By its end, we will have subjugated the Indians and expanded our domain to allow immigrants to settle in its heretofore untamed frontiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAAHUMANU;Following the death of Kamehameha II during his visit to England, Queen Ka'ahumanu became the regent of Hawai’i. The favorite wife of Kamehameha I, the founder of the kingdom, she wields a great amount of influence in the kingdom as she reigns over the minority of her stepson Kamehameha III. \nA devout Christian ever since her conversion in 1824, she has been notable for stamping out pagan practices in the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;
AGAINSTANIMISTS;Today, the Kuhina Nui has proposed an edict against a range of Hawaiian religious practices, including the worship of idols, the consumption of the intoxicating ‘awa plant, and the Hula dance. \nIn effect, she proposes to outlaw native Hawaiian religion entirely.

KAAHUMANUDIES;The Kuhina Nui, Ka’ahumanu, has died at the age of sixty-four. Both feared and beloved in life, her regency passes now to her step-daughter and daughter-in-law Kina'u. Many Hawaiians sill aligning with their native beliefs have breathed a sigh of relief at this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LONDONCONFERENCESTARTS;France, Russia and the UK have finished a conference in London to definitively delineate our borders and establish a permanent government. Their decision was to move our border a bit further North to the so-called Arta-Volos line and to install a Catholic Bavarian prince by the name of Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern. Another demand of the three guarantors is the final abolition of slavery in Greece. While this agreement would hand a significant amount of currently Ottoman land to us, having a German Catholic on our throne is almost unacceptable. However, if we refuse to abide by the conference's terms, our former guarantors may abandon us in the event of an Ottoman attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONDONCONFERENCE1832;France, Russia and the UK have finished a conference in London to establish a permanent government in Greece and definitively delineate its borders. Their decision was to move the border a bit further North to the so-called Arta-Volos line and install a Catholic Bavarian prince by the name of Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern. This means that we would lose even more land to the Greeks than had previously already been agreed on in the convention of 1830. However, if we refuse to conform to the will of the three guarantors of Greek independence, they will surely support Greek expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LONDONCONFERENCENOGPS;We and the other two great powers guaranteeing Greek independence held a conference in London to establish Greece's permanent government and definitively delineate its borders. In lieu of this, the three guarantors--Russia, France and the UK--decided to install Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern as the Greek king and extend the border North to the so-called Volos-Arta line. This has, however, infuriated the Ottomans, who refuse to amend the more favorable border agreed on in 1830.

LONDONCONFENOGPSTUR;The Greek government has refused to abide by the terms of the London Conference in which France, Russia and the UK, the three guarantors of Greek independence, agreed on Greece's final borders and form of government.

FERDINANDEAISLAND;A mysterious island never seen before has been discovered off the southwestern Sicilian coast. Its discovery was preceded by reports of significant earthquakes and a smell of sulfur pervading the Sicilian town of Sciacca--the following day the Italian brig Gustavo reported a bubbling from the sea that seemed connected enough to the strange occurrences. \n\nWithin a few days, the island had materialized, presumably after surfacing from the ocean. \n\nThis island certainly will be useful for connecting trade routes in the Mediterranean--highly valuable real estate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the heat of disputes over control of the enigmatic Ferdinandea Island between the UK, France, Sicily, Spain, and France, the island disappeared into the ocean.

Ferdinandea likely gave out due to wave activity, and its surface retreated below sea level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ecuador_const_1830_title;The Ecuadorian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ecuador_const_1830_desc;The separation of the Districto del Sur from Gran Colombia birthed the new state of Ecuador. As a former province of that once large yet eventually ungovernable country, we lack a national identity--and a constitution. President Juan José Flores has called a assembly to draft our future constitution to proclaim the State of Ecuador. With this said, our intention is to eventually rejoin a future confederated Colombia as one of its constitutent countries. Thus the constitution will contain no clause contradicting Colombia's constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ecuador_const_1835_desc;Juan José Flores' authoritarian policies have left him unpopular with the public--so much so that rebellions favoring the ascension of Vicente Rocafuerte to the presidency have broken out, leaving Flores' hands tied. He was forced to agree to handing the presidency to Rocafuerte while appointing himself as chief military commander. This power vacuum leaves us in a constitutional crisis. Our instability makes aspirations to rejoin Colombia impossible, and we must solidify our identity as a sovereign nation. Ecuador shall be independent forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAPOLEONTHESECONDDIES;The fated heir to Napóleon I's empire passed away today of tuberculosis. \n\nBorn in 1811, Napóleon II had been named Prince Imperial per the French Empire's constitution and was proclaimed King of Rome by his overly proud father. He reigned over France for two weeks after his father's second abdication in 1815, aged only three. The backdrop of the Allies' capture of Paris made an anticlimactic end to his ascension--though he ruled from Austria the entire time while living with his mother. Later he was granted the title of Duke of Reichstadt and was appointed as a cadet in the Austrian army. His military career fascinated and caused apprehension among European leaders, who feared he may usurp the French throne later as an adult. Alas, this never came to be. He died in Vienna's Schönbrunn Palace at 21.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMERICANANTISLAVERYSOCIETY;Slavery's continued existence in the United States continues to face challenges from outspoken critics. The American Anti-Slavery Society, formed by abolitionist journalist William Lloyd Garrison, has grown out of these outcries and vows to do all it can for the abolitionist cause. They are officially pacifist, but its members have signed a pact to show their willingness to become martyrs if necessary. \n\nThe abolitionists know slavery's status quo is slowly crumbling. With the Supreme Court already having proclaimed states cannot nullify federal laws, it is only a matter of time until an abolitionist Congress or president gains power and nationally outlaws slavery. The Anti-Slavery Society wishes in the meantime to appeal to Americans' morals to convince them of slavery's atrocity and sinfulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWZEALANDINDEPENDENCE;The Maori people of New Zealand have codified their nationhood in a documet titled "He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni"--the New Zealand Declaration of Independence. Thirty-four chiefs drafted and signed the document, creating a "Confederation of United Tribes." They hope to solicit the British for protection against French claims to the island, while also doing away with extraterritoriality the British settlers on the island enjoy. \n\nThe Maori chiefs are thankful for the British crown's efforts to officialize their nationhood by desgining a national flag, allowing them to legally trade with ports in New South Wales and Norfolk Island. But they may be terribly naive as to how willing Britain is to respect the independence of a small island nation ripe for colonizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Cape government must mount a swift retaliation if we are to put these raids to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ARC_prov_gov_conservative;The Federal League;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEOFONCATIVO;La Plata is in an on-off civil war, with armies fighting for control of the virtually non-existent federal government. The conflict's two factions, one supporting unitarianism and the other federalism, clashed today in a battle in Oncativo, Córdoba Province. The Unitarian forces of General José María Paz pushed back the Federalist troops led by Facundo Quiroga, showing potential weakness for the Federalist forces led by Buenos Aires. The Federalists had attempted a march toward the Platine interior through Córdoba. With this foiled, the Unitarians may push into the coast--unless Federalist provincial governors unite in a coalition against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARIANLEAGUE;The general José María Paz has declared the formation of the Unitarian League, or the League of the Interior, comprising all the western interior provinces of La Plata. These provinces' leaders vow to restore the unitarian form of government previously held under Bernardino Rivadavia, our first president. After our war with Brazil, the office of the president was declared in an attempt to consolidate La Plata's constantly feuding provinces, each trying to maintain autonomy under their respective caudillos. Rivadavia's authority was firmly rejected by the other provinces. Our country has been run as a weakly-bound confederacy since then. \n\nIf the League of the Interior succeeds, La Plata will be transformed: we will truly begin to think of ourselves as a nation. Nevertheless, they are a threat. Their belligerance challenges the caudillos' authority--and they will defend their lands to the death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEDERALPACT;In response to the Unitarian League's formation, the governors of Buenos Aires, Entre Ríos, and Santa Fé have convened to sign the Federal Pact, pledging commitment to preserving the country's federalism. The pact was proposed by the Buenos Aires governor, Juan Manuel de Rosas, a de facto dictator who has enforced his will through a private militia to maintain supremacy over all the other provinces. \n\nEach of the Pact's members enjoys free trade with each other and a pledge of military protection from other provinces' invasions. It goes to show that La Plata's legal status is so far removed from its reality: it is a collection of virtually independent provinces at each others' throats. But if through federalism is how we are destined to survive, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARYLEAGUEWAR;Federalist General Ángel Pacheco has made his first move in an offensive against the Unitarians. His Buenos Aires division landed an ambush on Unitarian troops in the town of Fraile Muerto, in Córdoba province. His troops' tactical upper hand was further guaranteed by how the ambushed division, led by General José María Paz, contained many former Federalist troops who were captured by the Unitarians and forced to fight for their side. These troops then switched sides again and asisted Pacheco's army. Together they are marching through Córdoba, forcing a Unitarian retreat and spelling true peril for their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

UNITARIANISMREVIVED;Rivadavia's government is avenged! A Unitarian victory has ensured La Plata will be united again as a centralized state, headed by the president in Buenos Aires.

occupy_falklands_desc;The Falkland Islands, or Las Islas Malvinas in Spanish, are a source of great territorial dispute. Having competed with both France and Spain for sovereignty over the islands, we are now left squabbling with the independent Argentine administration over whose countries rightfully deserves to control them. The Falklands' current Argentine governor, Luis Vernet, has ignored our diplomatic protests over the blocking of British fishing rights to the islands' coasts. With him in charge, the Falklands are sure to be consolidated under Argentine control, unless we use the military to retake them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MALVINASSONBRITANICAS;The British brig-sloop HMS Clio, commanded by Captain John James Onslow, docked in Puerto Soledad, Islas Malvinas, today to forcibly capture the islands. Upon arriving, he instructed Admiral José María Pinedo, leader of the Malvinas fleet, to surrender all his ships to Britain and allow the Union Jack to be hoisted on the port's docks. Pinedo contemplated resisting, though his forces' numerical disadvantage made it futile. \n\nThe loss of our territory again, even after our defeat of the Spanish, to European colonialism is an affront to the nation.

BLACKWAR;Ever since Europeans arrived on Australia, there has been conflict between the native Aboriginal peoples and the colonizers. The Black War, or the Tasmanian War as some call it, has plagued the island since 1803 when the first major settlements were established. The Aboriginal's skirmishes with the colonists more than doubled in intensity during the 1820s as a result of the settlers' continued attempts at killing the native people. Between 1826 and 1828 there were multiple major massacres resulting in the deaths of 408 Aboriginal Tasmanians and 61 British settlers. In 1830, lieutenant-governor George Arthur ordered 2,200 men, consisting of soldiers and free citizens, to persecute and forcibly relocate four out of the nine Aboriginal nations into a “reservation." The 31st of December 1831 officially marks the end of the Black War as the last resisting tribes whose numbers had dwindled to 28 people have surrendered after years of persecution and genocide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After independence, however, the capital switched to San José, to some protest that prompted the federal government to create four equal-status capitals. This changed when the current head of state, Braulio Carrillo Colina, repealed the Ambulance Law, cementing San José as the sole Costa Rican capital.

TITHEWAR;Tithe payments are a tax imposed on farmers in Ireland. They pay 10 percent of the value of their agricultural produce to the clergy for the sake of financing the church. This has been a rather unpopular tax within the Catholic Irish communities, resulting in multiple clashes and protests. The "war" took a turn in 1831 when the Irish Constabulary fired on people resisting payments, killing 12 and wounding another 20. This event led anti-tithe protestors to ambush 40 Constabularies, killing 12, including the Chief Constabulary. Today, 200,000 people have gathered in Ballyhale in support of those being charged for the events that resulted in the 1831 killings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BANIKHALID;The Bani Khalid Emirate, once powerful enough to drive the Ottomans from the Persian Gulf, has suffered a long decline. Until recently, they barely existed, as their tribal confederation fractured further with the loss of confidence in leadership. In a final battle, we have now defeated out the last of the forces of the Bani Khalid, sealing their fate forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERALAZORES;The Liberal forces of Dom Pedro, ex-Emperor of Brazil and Regent for his daughter Maria da Glória, the claimant to the throne, have landed in the Azores and defeated our garrison. They dispute the legitimacy of Dom Miguel I and are supported by liberal agitants in Portugal who chafe under Dom Miguel I's absolutist rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DOMPEDRODED;Except for bouts of epilepsy that manifested in seizures every few years, Pedro had always enjoyed robust health. The war, however, undermined his constitution and he has now died of tuberculosis after a long and painful illness. One of his last acts was to dictate an open letter to Brazil: 'Slavery is an evil, and an attack against the rights and dignity of the human species, but its consequences are less harmful to those who suffer in captivity than to the Nation whose laws allow slavery. It is a cancer that devours its morality.' He will always be remembered for having ousted the tyrannical Dom Miguel I and having brought constitutionalism to Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINDELOLANDING;Liberal forces loyal to Dom Pedro have landed at Mindelo, seeking to overthrow his brother Dom Miguel, who has usurped the throne. With them, they have 60 ships and 7500 men, consisting of Constitutionalist forces loyal to Queen Maria II and her regent Dom Pedro, as well as a number of foreign volunteers. The landing caught the Absolutist forces by surprise, and Porto was captured swiftly thereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BATTLEPONTEFERREIRA;Our forces, pursued by Miguelite troops, have been forced to retreat to the safety of Porto after a failed attack on a larger Miguelite army. At 3 AM our forces launched another attack on the Miguelite army. The Miguelites eventually retreated following heavy casualties, but the battle would prove indecisive: Another Miguelite force has been spotted approaching the city of Porto from the south of the river Douro. Our forces have now retreated back into the city to hold its fortifications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BATTLESTVINCENT;Our navy commanded by British naval officer and Vice Admiral of the Portuguese navy Charles Napier has today defeated the Miguelite navy off the coast of Cape St. Vincent! Even though the Constitutionalist fleet was outnumbered by the Miguelites, the battle proved to be a decisive victory for the Liberal side. A bold tactic of closing in- and boarding the numerically superior Miguelite ships, Napier managed to secure Constitutionalist naval supremacy, as well as capturing 4 ships of the line, 1 frigate, and 1 corvette. The result of this engagement means the siege of Porto has been broken, and full out war will break out imminently!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

COVADAPIEDADE;The Constitutionalist forces have landed in the south of Portugal, led by Captain General António de Noronha. The army landed near Faro, and started its march up north through Alentejo towards the capital, Lisbon. The Miguelites responded by hastily gathering forces to stop the Constitutionalists from advancing and capturing the capital, resulting in a clash at Cova de Piedade. The Miguelites eventually get driven back into the Castle of Almada, which is captured by the Liberal forces a day later. Now that the way to Lisbon lays unopposed, there is nothing to stop the Constitutionalists from taking the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MPRLOSES;The Miguelite army, led by General Guedes, set camp on a strong position at the Heights of Asseiceira. Our troops have been deployed to attack their position in three columns, commanded by Colonels Quierós, Nepomuceno and Vasconcelos, which were in turn led by Captain General António de Noronha who was responsible for the capture of Lisbon. The battle was a resounding success for our armies, resulting in Dom Miguel failing to rally his officers behind him for another battle. This marks the end of the civil war, with the usurper Miguel capitulating his title and claim, and being banished from the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The commander of our forces, a brigadier by the name of Luís Guedes, set up camp on the defensive hills and showed an outstanding use of artillery, halting the Constitutionalist attack. The success of this victory, resulted in our forces taking back Lisbon within a week, prompting the pretender, Dom Pedro to end his campaign and flee to Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LAGRANJA;Inspired by the 1830 French Revolution, exiled Spanish liberals have organized many unsuccessful military coups--known as pronunciamentos in Spanish--to re-establish the 1812 Constitution and end Fernando VII's absolute monarchy. The most notable of these was the pronunciamento of general José Torrijos, who ended up shot. The latest to occur was today, in the palace of La Granja, where King Fernando resides. On the 16th, Ferdinand's health took a turn for the worse, and he was expected to die at any moment. His wife, María Cristina, was then betrayed by the top brass in the army, who refused to acknowledge her regency. Thus, she influenced her husband to revoke the Pragmatic Sanction, preventing Carlos Isidro from ascending the throne. On the 18th, Fernando's father, Carlos IV, as regent annulled the Salic law of succession in the Spanish monarchy, attempting to make the royal line patrilineal. But today, unexpectedly, Ferdinand VII has recovered his health, dismissed ministers supporting Carlos's ascension, and repealed his father's decree, making Isabel the heir to the throne again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAGRANJAOPT;And they fail... again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1835TREATYOFLISBOA;Today an agreement between Portugal and Spain has been signed to guarantee both nations free navigation of the Douro River and the use of Porto and Fregeneda as customs ports, bringing prosperity to this sparsely inhabited area in the center of our nation. Let us hope that this treaty will lead to more future cooperation between Spain and Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TORRIJOSPRONOUNCEMENT;Liberals launched another pronunciamento today in Málaga, though it failed after its organizers fell into a trap set by our navy and the captain general of Andalusia. In May, the insurgent general José María Torrijos presented his plan for this insurrection, consisting of a "circumferential" penetration of the country to attack the center, Madrid, from various points. They would pick up liberal sympathizers along the way to encircle the capital, hoping their numbers would suffice to overwhelm the Spanish army. But first, they were to cross into Spanish territory from Gibraltar, with Torrijos leading them, to signal the uprising’s start. Málaga’s governor confided anonymously to Torrijos in September that the best place for the landing would be the coast of Málaga, where he would be assured of the support of local garrisons. On November 30th, two boats with sixty men headed by Torrijos left Gibraltar. They found their destination after forty hours of travel—however, they were met with gunfire from the docked Spanish ship Neptune, and the conspirators have now all been executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FIRSTCARLISTWAR;Today, contingents of an ideology called "Carlism"--nicknamed after Fernando VII's brother and Spain's heir apparent, Carlos María Isidro--have taken up arms against the regency of María Cristina de Borbón. Catalonia, Aragon, Vasconia and Valencia run red with blood, and their populations, blinded by Carlism, are fighting for them. The Carlist uprisings are fueled by Fernando VII's death and the enactment of the Pragmatic Sanction, a liberal law to allow Isabel II to be the heir to the throne. For Isabel to take the throne instead of the megalomaniacal Carlos would mean a new era of prosperity for the nation. Viva Isabel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PRAGMATICSANCTION1830;Today, the Spanish government has published the contents of the 1789 Pragmatic Sanction, passed in that year unanimously by the court, which reinstates the traditional system of succession and abandons that which Felipe V introduced in 1713. From the year of its passing until now, the Sanction never would be revealed to the public and, therefore, had no legal validity. After the death of his third wife, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, King Fernando VII announced in September 1829 that he would marry again. He chose the Neapolitan princess María Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies as his bride, despite her being his niece and twenty-two years his younger. They married on December 10th that year. A few months later Fernando would declare the Pragmatic Sanction of 1789 fully in effect, ensuring that his eldest child—even if they were a girl—would succeed him. The decree has produced discontent among those would desire Carlos María Isidro, Fernando’s brother, to succeed to the throne—thus creating the Carlist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTICLERICALRIOTS1835;A series of riots against the clergy, inspired by the massacre of friars in Madrid produced a year ago, have begun to sow chaos in Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia. The violence is motivated by the clergy's support for Carlism and its work to suppress liberalism. By order of Valencia’s captain general, the archbishop of Barcelona left the country with a military escort and took refuge in Bordeaux, France. He escaped before being able to see the violence reach new heights of bloodshed, with no end in sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTICLERICALRIOTS1835OPT;That was unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ROYALSTATUTE1834;Regent María Cristina de Borbón has issued a new Royal degree to overhaul Spain’s federal government. The decree introduces a bicameral legislature to Spain. It consists of the Estate of Próceres, whose members will be appointed by royalty and the high nobility, and an Estate of Solicitors, whose members will be elected by a vote of 16,000 people, less than 2% of the country's population. The decree clearly takes inspiration from the British parliamentary system. Being conservative in nature, the statute has pleased both reactionaries and conservatives, among them Carlists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FERNANDODIED;A capable and popular king, Fernando struggled to preserve the traditional Spanish way of life. After a reign of 25 years which began in 1808 when his father, Charles IV, abdicated, seeing the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of the viceroyalties, King Ferdinand VII has died today at the age of 49. Somewhat famous for inbreeding, the genetics of the Spanish house of Bourbon cursed Fernando to, despite having been married four times since 1802, have difficulty in having children. Indeed, his parents were cousins, his first marriage was to a cousin and his second and fourth marriages to nieces. Finally, in 1830, Isabel II was born and designated as his heir by the Pragmatic Sanction. However, as his brother, Carlos María Isidro de Borbón, has refused to accept Isabel II's legitimacy, his death has left a succession crisis behind—with one of the factions, the Carlists, already beginning to show signs of an impending rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRITISHSOCOTRA;The British have proposed a treaty to buy the island of Socotra as a coaling station for 30,000 pounds sterling. While this is a lot of money that would surely benefit us, Britain could use the island as an outpost to invade Yemen. Our countrymen on the island would certainly feel abandoned if we were to turn them over to the Brits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With president Orbegoso visiting Arequipa, a revolt broke out among unpaid soldiers and officers garrisoning the Real Felipe del Callao Fortress. Salaverry took the fortress by storm and ended the mutiny. Using his new position of power, he conspired with the rebellious garrison to stage a coup together with his own forces. With the former conservative Bermudists joining his cause against the liberal Orbegoso, Salaverry has taken control of most of Peru with little resistance. However, Orbegoso's main base of support in the liberal South has refused to recognize Salaverry's authority. Orbegoso has approached the Bolivians to seek support against Salaverry, and the war to come will decide the fate of Peru.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although we have the Ottomans on the run, we must consider that our army is also somewhat depleted and will have difficulties standing up to the largest army on Earth -- Russia's.

We would certainly have another opportunity to finish them off for good later on after having time to lick our wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHATOWAR;The region of Champa, in central and southern Vietnam, was reduced to the principalities of Panduranga and Kauthara on the eve of the 16th century. Kauthara was annexed by the Vietnamese halfway through the 17th century, and by now Panduranga has lost its hereditary monarchy status, with kings being appointed by the Vietnamese court in Hue. Panduranga officials have recently been supporting the rival faction of Le Van Duyet, in defiance of the Vietnamese suzerain. In response, Emperor Minh Mang has declared that the Cham king, Po Phaok The, ought to be arrested, and that Champa must be incorporated into the Vietnamese Empire for the king's treasonous behavior.

KATIPSUMAT;Recently, rumors have been brought to light that the Cham Muslim leader Katip Sumat has spent the early months of 1833 gathering his followers in a remote base in the countryside. Demanding from his followers "absolute loyalty to Allah and Islam," he had been preaching the Qur’an and disseminating Islamism, defending the establishment of an Islamist Vietnam and a jihad against the Nguyen dynasty. With their flags raised, and the words Po Rasak written upon them – meaning His Great Glorious Wonderful – a clear implication for either Allah or the prophet Muhammad, the rebels have just launched attacks against Vietnamese tax register centers and military garrisons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JATHAKWA;Following our suppression of Katip Sumat’s Islamist uprising in the summer of last year, the Cham people are once again acting against our rule, and it appears that they are being supported by the Montagnards. Attacking our provinces from Binh Tuan to Phu Yuen, reports reveal that Ja Thak Wa, a Cham Muslim cleric, is the leader of this revolt. It seems that his main interest is in proclaiming a new Champa dynasty, as he has announced that Po War Palei, the son-in-law of the last deputy ruler of the Champa, as the new King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHAMGENOCIDE;Minh Mang, Emperor of Vietnam, had dispatched over 3,000 troops to deal with the Cham rebels since the beginning of the uprisings in the region. The monarch had promised good remittances for soldiers who killed and beheaded rebels, and a wave of massacres and systematic killings took the Cham people by a storm. Slow slicing and rampant mass killings allowed the fury of Vietnamese troops to turn into a de facto ethnocide in Champa, with competitions between the Vietnamese royal troops and Kinh paramilitary units. By the summer of 1835, the Champa king, Po War Lei, was killed in action, and Ja Thak Wa was captured by Vietnamese troops and sentenced to death. Seven to twelve Cham villages were scrambled to the ground, and the murders and exile of other revolutionaries such as Po Phoak The, and the demolition of Cham temples, cemeteries and villages, signals the end of large-scale Cham revolts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GEORGEIVDED;His Majesty, George IV of the United Kingdom, has passed away today, in 1830. Born in 1762, crowned King in 1820, and dead in 1830, George was known for his absurd eating habits, his vast consumption of alcohol and his usage of laudanum to ease chronic pains. Weighing 280 pounds at his passing, George had arteriosclerosis, gout and suffered, like his father, from cataracts. The Scottish artist David Wilkie had remarked that the monarch looked like “a great sausage stuffed into the covering” due to his immense size. Having a rule marked by scandal due to his mistresses, his financial extravagance and a “selfish, unreliable and irresponsive” personality, George gradually grew ill due to his awful habits, with intensifying coughs at the time of his death. Clutching his stomach, the King died from an upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from the rupture of a blood vessel in his stomach. According to some versions, George’s last words were: “my boy [to his page], this is death”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOUISIDED;Grand Duke Ludwig I of Baden has died at the age of 67, leaving the succession of his titles in the hands of his half-brother, Leopold. His life accomplishments during his reign include securing the continued existence of the University of Freiburg, and founding the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe which will go on to become the oldest technical school in Germany. Ludwig’s death means the extinction of his line in the Baden family. There has been much gossiping and rumor-fabrication surrounding his death, some saying that a mysterious 17 year old man named Kaspar Hauser who appeared in 1828 is the illegitimate son of Ludwig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LUDWIGHESSEDED;The Grand Duke Ludwig I of Hessen-Darmstadt has passed away at the age of 76. Succeeding his father, Ludwig IX, Ludwig I was elevated to Grand Duke of Hesse in 1806, due to allying Napoleon I, and joined the Confederation of the Rhine. During the Congress of Vienna, Ludwig would lose his Westphalian territories, but was compensated with the district of Rheinhessen. Because of this acquired territory, he changed his title to Grand Duke of Hesse by the Rhine. He is succeeded by his eldest son, Ludwig II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

baden_tithe_abolition_desc;The practice of tithing, or the mandated payment in-kind of peasants' production to their landlord as part of their feudal obligations, has for over a decade been under scrutiny by our government: In addition to hindering efforts to modernize agricultural practices, transporting and storing tithe goods incurs a significant logistical burden and results in significant wastage of agricultural output. The Baden Estates have come to a resolution to finally begin the abolition of this ancient practice, allowing for estates to forgo tithing in exchange for a compensatory pension equivalent to twenty times a tithe's appraised annual value, with twenty percent of this pension being supplied by a state tithe replacement fund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

brunswick_constitution_1832_desc;After the revolution of 1830, liberal reforms and a new constitution have been proposed by members of the Upper House.

The parliament would also be granted more rights than in most other German states while limiting the Duke’s power and monetary budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYECHARLESBRUNSWICK;While Charles II of Brunswick technically reigned for 15 years, over half of it was through the prince-regent of Great Britain and Hanover. Charles was set to take the throne at the age of 19. However, when he turned 18, Hanover rushed through constitutional reforms that limited his powers, redefined his duchy, hereditary lands and due income. Charles ended his regency early, declaring in an edict that Hanover was a usurper and that the new constitution imposed by it was invalid because it limited his powers and went against all international norms of law, causing outrage in Hanover and England. The German Confederation attempted to intervene in the matter and ordered Charles to accept the new constitution, which he promptly disregarded, keeping Brunswick an absolute monarchy. This year, however, amidst the July Revolution, Charles' absolutism has been getting less popular in Brunswick, culminating in a large mob breaking into the palace to overthrow him, placing his brother William as Duke in his stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTTINGERREV;Liberal citizens of Göttingen started an armed uprising on the 8th of January with the goal of abolishing the feudal governing system. The uprising was quenched on the 16th of January, while the general state of the rest of Hanover remained calm. The reason for the uproar in Göttingen looks to be related to a widespread hatred for a specific book, written by Friedrich Wilhelm Boldewin von dem Knesebeck in praise of the nobility as a preserver of stability. Friedrich implied that stronger surveillance against liberal advocates was necessary, which seems to have been the cause of the recent troubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAX1830REV;1827 marked the death of King Friedrich August I, who was succeeded by King Anton. Anton has so far failed to enact any reforms throughout his 3 years of rule, but this has primarily been blamed on the cabinet minister Detlev von Einsiedel who remains the politically dominant figure within the Kingdom. In June, many of our subjects started outspokenly criticizing the current regime's lack of liberal reforms, primarily in Leipzig where the 300th anniversary of the Confessio Augustana of 1530 was being celebrated. Many felt the ban on wearing student uniforms- a symbol of liberalism- was a form of harassment, and have taken to the streets in protest. Local authorities dispatched police, which increased liberal resistance even further. After the July Revolution in France, protests have started to become more common, with the Leipzig protest repeating in September. From Leipzig, unrest has more recently begun spreading to other cities, such as Dresden. King Anton has now convened a security commission, seeking to deal with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The king would be head of the government, but could not become ruler of another state (save by blood inheritance) without consent of the Diet or parliament. The king's decrees have to be countersigned by at least one of his ministers, and without it, none of the king's acts could be considered valid. The king would have supreme power over religious matters, and could overrule any judgement delivered in court of law. The king has the power to promote laws, and without his consent no proposals for laws may be passed in the Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, as the joint Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet intervened in the Battle of Navarino and sank the Egyptian navy, leading to our defeat in the war. Now, the scheming Muhammad Ali has declared war on us, using their lack of compensation for intervening in Greece as a casus belli, as he never received Crete, Cyprus or Morea. With his recent reforms of administration and army organization, his forces pose a legitimate threat to the levant. We must rally our forces and crush Egypt once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

UCALIBERALSTHIRTYFIVE;José Gregorio Salazar y Castro, a conservative, won the election of 1834 and became supreme leader of the Federal Republic of Central America. However, the El Salvador-based liberals have been becoming ever more influential in the federation's legislative assembly. They have now used their power to declare the election results null with bogous claims of electoral fraud. Gregorio has sullenly agreed to hand over supreme command to Francisco Morazán, head of the liberals. The new government has even relocated the capital from Guatemala to El Salvador, solidifying its new seat of power. While the liberals are celebrating their successful takeover, the conservatives are plotting their revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAVOIEINVASION;Several Mazzinian exiles have attempted to overthrow King Vittorio Emmanuele I. They accused the Sovereign of consolidating central power for himself, giving life to an absolutism that would not have admitted opposition. The revolt involved an invasion of Savoy from the French border and direct action from infamous Italian republican Giuseppe Garibaldi, who would organize a revolt within the Kingdom’s fleet and meet them up with the invaders. \n\nBut the Piedmontese troops expected an invasion for some time, thanks to some information reports received beyond the border. In fact, leading insurgent general Girolamo Ramorino immediately realized the impossibility of the success of the plan, both the invasion of Savoy and Garibaldi's  mutiny. The rebellion’s failure led to some of its organizers, such as Ramorino and fellow general Giovanni Battista Scapaccino, to renounce their republican ideals and defect again to the monarchy. Garibaldi, meanwhile, has gone back into hiding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_title;The Kurhessische Verfassung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_desc;A new constitution modeled to some extent after that of England, has been supported by the Elector. This new constitution would establish a popular representation in a Diet or Congress of the provinces, and would extend liberty of speech and that of the press. The constitution would also seek to separate royal and state revenues, and make ministers swear an oath to the constitution, as well as implementing an impeachment system for ministers who break their oath. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_title;The Staatgrundgesetz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_desc;The Staatsgrundgesetz, a constitution proposed by the estates and supported by cabinet minister Caspar Detlev von Schulte would liberalize our monarchy to appease the left and prevent a repetition of the events of 1830. It would combine the Generalsteuerkasse with the Königliche Generalkasse to a singular Steuerkasse and give the power to set our country's budget to the estates. The city of Hannover's magistrates that the government currently appoints would be made independent with a simple government veto right to their appointment, giving the city more autonomy. More importantly, it would open the upper house of the estates to farmers and the middle class. While staunch conservatives oppose this constitution, it is clearly necessary to maintain the stability of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAPODISTRASDED;Ex-foreign minister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia - and first governor of Greece - Ioannis Kapodistrias, has just been murdered on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplion. His assassination was carried out by the disgruntled brother and son of one Petrobey Mavromichalis (a popular and successful leader in the uprising against Ottoman rule), whose imprisonment had been ordered by Kapodistrias. Konstantinos- Ioannis’ brother, and Ioannis’ son Georgios waited on the steps of the church, and killed Kapodistrias by stabbing him in the chest, and consecutively shooting him in the head. After the deed, Konstantis was shot by general Fotomaris, who witnessed the murder from his window. Georgios, however, had slipped away from the scene and would only surrender to authorities days later. He was subsequently put to death by firing squad, his last words being: “Peace Brothers!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;
althorpact_title;Althorp's Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
althorpact_desc;The Factory Act, or Althorp’s Act, would seek to establish a regular working day, specifically for children in the workforce. Children through the ages 9-12 are limited to 48 hours of work per week, children under the age of 9 would not be allowed in factories (apart from silk mills), children under the age of 18 are not allowed to work at night, children through the ages 9-13 must not work more than 8 hours a day with an hour lunchbreak, children through the ages 14-18 must not work more than 12 hours with an hour lunchbreak. The Act would also establish a Factory Inspectorate, and allow for routine factory inspections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALAWITEREV;While having been relatively content with autonomous rule in the mountains of Latakia, the Alawis within our borders have started organizing an uprising at a scale we have yet to see. The cause of the recent unrest is partly due to the call for mass mobilization by Muhammad Ali, which upset the Alawites who remain loyal to the Ottomans. During a march of Egyptian soldiers from Aleppo to Latakia some 4,000 Alawi militants attacked the column, forcing the Egyptians to retreat to Latakia. The Alawite forces pursued, and laid siege to Latakia, causing much damage and monetary loss. We need to act now to return order to our rebellious provinces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PEASANTSPALESTINEREVOLT;Egypt's war effort against the Ottomans has led to extreme unrest in Palestine. To gather an army capable of marching to Constantinople, Ibrahim Pasha has ordered a fifth of all Muslims under Egyptian rule to be conscripted, including those in the now-conquered Levant. With this extensive draft has come high taxes that are draining the income of Levantine Arab peasants. These peasants, not owning land of their own, receive housing on the farms they tend to by their landlord and are meanwhile paid a subsistence wage that cannot survive high taxing.\n\nWith these factors contributing to huge unrest, the Palestinian sheikh Qasim al-Ahmad has ordered his followers to disobey the Egyptian draft orders and refuse to pay these taxes. Peasants and nobles alike have declared an open revolt, storming cities such as Hebron, Nablus, and Safed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPANISHCHOLERA;It's been nine months since cholera hit France, and our authorities knew it was only a matter of time before it came to Spain as well. Over the past month, cholera was reported in Vigo, Galicia, which now hosts the majority of cases in all the country. The outbreak initially was caused by the landing of auxiliary troops in Portugal, where the War of Portuguese Succession still rages on. Almost instantly another outbreak emerged in Barcelona. But cases are spreading most widely in the south, where thousands of deaths have occurred. The plague is bringing winds of rebellion to the population, who resent the government's poor response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ODAALAPATRIA;A poem in Catalan entitled 'La Pàtria,' or 'The Homeland' in English, by Carles Aribau, has been published recently. The poem is fueling the rebirth of Catalan as a literary language and, thus, its re-emergence in everyday use. It tells of the longing for an independent Catalonia and exalts the Catalan language--a clear threat to the unity of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANKFURTERWACHENSTURM;There is a spectre haunting Germany--that of liberalism--and its effects are becoming more and more visible. Today, fifty students stormed Frankfurt's Hauptwache and Konstablerwache police offices, attempting to gain access to the German Confederacy's treasury. This, in turn, would enable them to hold the Confederacy's leadership hostage and force the German states' unification. The police summarily apprehended the perpetrators. Eight of them, however, escaped to the United States. \n\nIt remains to be seen how much more influence these revolutionaries' circles will gain in Germany. One of the groups participating in the attack, the Burschenschaft, will not rest until Germany becomes a single political entity for the first time in over a millennium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RESTORERSARGQUOTEUNQUOTE;A dreary silence hangs over Buenos Aires, the calm forced upon a city after the sudden topple of the provincial government. The previously-elected governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Ramón Balcarce, has been been deposed and replaced with Juan José Viamonte, a crony of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Balcarce provoked the anger of the Rosas-supporting federalists after announcing that Rosas would be tried for treason, having seized absolute power during his governance from 1829 to 1832. Thus, a contingent of federalists immediately headed for Buenos Aires from Rosas' military campaign in the Pampas and threatened to forcibly oust Balcarce. Rosas' wife, Encarnación Ezcurra, worked behind the scenes to ensure further military support for the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

KRAKOWCONSTITUTION1833;Our constitution as an independent city-state has been revised under the supervision of Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich. Having started the redrafting in 1832 and completed it this year, our government has consequently been reorganized to grant more power to the occupation authorities of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Dissidents have also been purged from our Senate. We are only independent in name now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

munchengratz_conference_desc;The Ottomans' fate is inextricably tied to the welfare and security of Central and Eastern Europe. Having been pushed out of the Levant by Egypt, there is an increased risk that the Ottoman Empire may fall and disrupt the balance of power maintained after Napoleon's defeat. Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich, therefore, proposes petitioning our former allies in the Holy Alliance--Prussia and Russia--to act together with us to maintain the Ottomans' stability. This would ensure no one power exerts total control over the Ottomans' domestic and foreign policies--least of all Russia, who gained the ability to close the Dardanelles to foreign trade at will in the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi. We would also ensure a symbolic preservation of the conservative status quo as each of the monarchies in the former Holy Alliance battle surges of liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

INCORPORATIONOFPERTH;The Swan River colony was established in 1829, declared by Captain Charles Fremantle of the HMS Challenger and has continued to sustain a decently sizable population since, with today’s numbers reaching 1500 people. The name is only a pars pro toto for Western Australia, and it has now been approved for a more formal renaming to include a larger area under a single lieutenant-governor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOSHANGANELIKESTROLLING;Word has reached us that Zulu King Dingane kaSenzangakhona has attacked the Portuguese fort at Lourenço Marques. The garrison had apparently already largely fled and didn't put up a fight, allowing the victorious Zulu to sack the settlement and return to their lands in the South. This now leaves a power vacuum: With the Portuguese crushed and the Zulu horde headed back South, the coast is undefended and ripe for the picking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOSHANGANEREKT;Disaster has struck our settlement in Lourenço Marques. The prosperous slave trading port has long been our center of control over the southern coast of Mozambique and central hub of the commerce taking place in nearby trading posts. The initial calamity was Zulu King Dingane kaSenzangakhona's recent sudden attack on the settlement. A large portion of the garrison fled the fort along with governor Dionísio António Ribeiro who was later hunted down and killed. The remaining token force surrendered to the invaders without a fight, leaving the Zulu to plunder Lourenço Marques. After the Zulus returned to their lands in the South, a new force arrived from the North: The Gaza Kingdom under Soshangane. Not only did he expel the remainder of our forces from the southern coast, he even crushed an expedition from Sofala, forcing our several of our colonial districts to recognize him as king and pay him tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NOONGARMASSACRE;The Binjarebs, a Nyungar tribe, have clashed with Western Australian colonists since the colony's foundation in 1829, when thousands of settlers began fencing off land and hunting the native wild-life, causing food shortages for the Aboriginal people. These clashes culminated in the colony's Governor, James Stirling, leading a detachment of 25 soldiers, police, and settlers to attack the Binjarebs. Over the next hour they shot and killed between 15 and 80 Nyungar men, women and children. The police superintendent was speared and later died. The Perth Gazette noted the attack as a "severe but well merited chastisement". ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TILIMSANINCIDENT;After consulting the ulama of Fez, Abd al-Rahman sent our troops to defend Tlemcen in 1830, consisting of 5,000 cavalry and two pieces of artillery from Fes, under the son of the sultan, Ali. The troops established their headquarters at Tlemcen. Our troops were warmly welcomed, even in the provinces of Tittery and Constantine, however upon discovering that Turkish and Kouloughli remnants were still fighting among themselves, angered by the stalemate, undisciplined Moroccan soldiers rampaged through the streets of Tlemcen. Should we order them to withdraw before they cause chaos?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WADIYAREVOLT;As a result of the Wadiya's withdrawal from Tilimsan some months ago, the Wadiya, military tribes which defend the borders of the state and provide regular contingents to the army, have revolted all around the countryside, from Hasaymatu to Agadir, and recognised a relative of the sultan, Mohammed bin al-Tayyib, as sultan.. Fez is under siege, and the sultan has escaped to Meknes with the al-Bukhari, corps of black-African slaves and Haratin slave-soldiers, only loyal to the sultan. We should stop this rebellion and crack down on the Wadaya!\n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
