liberate_finland_title;Liberate Finland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liberate_finland_desc;§RGain 7 infamy§! As part of the Napoleonic Wars, we fought the Russians in the Finnish War, from early 1808 to late 1809, resulting in the loss of Finland and the nail in the coffin to Sweden's position as a great power in Europe, even after their union with Norway in 1814. Now, with our status restored, it is time for us to right this wrong and liberate Finland from the Russian yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800807;\n\nWe have long been observing the developments in Scandinavia, with the consolidation of an Scandinavian power, it is only natural that we would stand ready for its interest on our lands. It seems that it was only a matter of time for our suspicions to be proved true, as today an envoy from the west came with a offer: We can either swear fealty to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and they will protect us from Russian retaliation or we can remain under Russian overlordship and be "liberated" by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800808;\n\nWe have long been observing the developments in Scandinavia, with the consolidation of an Scandinavian power, it is only natural that we would stand ready for its interest on our lands. It seems that it was only a matter of time for our suspicions to be proved true, as we just recieve the news that our officials in Helsinki have been arrested and Finland has declared themselves free from the Russian rule, with support from our Scandinavian neighbours. It seems that the only option left is to once again fight for control over Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800809;\n\nAfter a series of impressive victories against Russia, the Russian Bear has finally agreed to sit at the negotiation table and hear our demands. While we haven’t yet finalized what our demands will be, we already have a solid idea of what exactly we intend to take from Russia. \n\nFirst, the most conservative option would be to restore the 1808 borders and use this as a basis for a treaty of friendship with Russia — guaranteeing their passage through the Øresund while not renouncing any future claims on their territory. The most popular proposal, on the other hand, would be to demand the entirety of the Grand Duchy of Finland.And last but not least, the most radical option would be to take all of Finland and Karelia as well, significantly shortening our border with Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800810;\n\nWhile we were defeated in the Second Finnish War, upon seeing our enemies demands we were pleseantly surprised in seeing that they are quite generous. Not only they intend on restoring the 1808 borders, but they also offered us a treaty of eternal friendship, that would not only turn us into allies, but also prevent any future claims on us and ensure our acces through the Øresund. While some advisors hold ressentment towards $FROMCOUNTRY$, we can't deny that the best option would be to swallow our pride and accept the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800811;\n\nWith our victory over Russia, Finland is firmly under our control and its fate lies in our hands. It is only natural that, following the end of the war, the place of Finland in our nation would start to be debated. It is clear that this could go one of two ways, with either Finland being entirely integrated into our nation or being granted a certain degree of autonomy, similar to what they had under Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800812;\n\nWhile Karelia wasn't in our initial plans, during our war against Russia, we counted with the support of Karelian insurgents and auxiliaries. After the war, we obviously couldn't leave them in Russian hands, annexing Karelia to ensure that Russia woudln't retaliate against them after our withdrawal from the region. Now the question stands, do we integrate them or do we set up a military government in the region so they can govern themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800813;\n\nDespite Scandinavian aggression against us, we managed to win the Second Finnish War, securing our control over Finland. Now we must decide what to do with the defeated aggressors. Naturally, we will integrate Finland to ensure that such a conflict never happens again, but some of our advisors have expressed interest in acquiring additional territory — such as Finnmark, which, despite its Arctic location, would serve as a warm-water port for us, and the islands of Gotland and Bornholm, which would both strengthen our presence in the Baltic Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SWE_purchase_guadeloupe_title;The Guadeloupe Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;
SWE_purchase_guadeloupe_desc;During the Napoleonic Wars the british transfered control of Guadeloupe to us as compensation for the lands Charles XIV John gave up to become the swedish king. After barely more than a year of swedish rule it was traded it back to the french in exchange for a yearly payment by the british to the swedish monarchy. It is time we try to regain the island, its strategic value is more important to us than some meek payment by the british.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310001;Sweden seeks to buy Guadeloupe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310001;\n\nThe Swedish government has approached us with an offer to buy the caribbean island of guadeloupe from us. This would mean we lose a strategically important part of our caribbean in exchange for a well needed cash infusion. Should we accept this peculiar offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310001;Why not, Guadeloupe isnt particularly valuable to us anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19310001;Absolutely not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310002;The French accept our offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310002;\n\nThe lovely government in paris has agreed to the purchase and will transfer control of the island to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310002;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310003;The French decline our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310003;\n\nThose frog-eaters in paris declined our offer. Quite sad however there really isnt much we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310003;Well then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310004;The British withdraw the Guadeloupe Fund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310004;\n\nAs somewhat expected, the british parliament has decided to withdraw the Guadeloupe fund. Given that the payments were reparations for us not owning the island, they see it fit that since we now own the island, they dont need to pay. This will most likely hit the lifestyle of the monarchy a little bit, but its nothing the income from our new colony cant make up for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310004;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
november_constitution_title:The November Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
november_constitution_desc;§RGain 3 infamy This will lead to the 2nd Schleswig War§! With King Frederick VII showing no sight of producing a valid heir. With fears of the succession of the Schleswig and Holstein being disputed, some of our advisors are already drafting a new constitution that would keep Denmark and Schleswig united, creating a joing parliament, making sure the duchy won't be separated from Denmark. On the other hand, that would most certainly violate the London Protocol, which clearly stated that Schleswig and Holstein shouldn't be separated. While the new constitution ins't needed yet, with King Frederick VII showing no sign of producing a heir, it is only a matter of time before the Augustenburgs get a opportunity to vindicate Prince Frederick and strip Schleswig-Holstein from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800814;\n\nAfter seizing Kiel and declaring a provisional government for Holstein, Prince Frederick of Noer has contacting the German Confederation, the Frankurt National Assembly has called for the liberation of Schleswig-Holstein for the German Empire, ordering us to enact their will on Denmark. \n\nWith the news of the war reaching our capital, liberals have once again began to rally for the creation of a German Empire, pressuring our government to save Schleswig-Holstein. Having suffered from a loss of prestige during the Springtime of Nations, declaring war would undoubtedly placate the liberals and recover a bit of our lost prestige, but on the other hand, our government has no interest in bending the knee to these liberal agitators, much less to see a united German Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800815;\n\nWhile our government has experienced relative stability despite the Springtime of Nations happening in Europe, we got worrying news of a war breaking between Berlin and Copenhagen. Much to our dismay, such a war is guaranteed to break the balance of power in the Baltic Sea, with Denmark being annexed into Germany in the worst of cases. While we have no real obligation to help Denmark, by sending a few soldiers to Fyn and providing them support, we could not only improve relations between our nations, but also guarantee that the Prussians aren't able to occupy the Danish Archipelago, securing the Øresund and Copenhagen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800816;\n\nWhile our government has experienced relative stability despite the Springtime of Nations happening in Europe, we got worrying news of a war breaking between Berlin and Copenhagen. Much to our dismay, such a war is guaranteed to break the balance of power in the Baltic Sea, with Denmark being annexed into Germany in the worst of cases. While we have no real obligation to help Denmark, by sending a few vessels to the North Sea, we could send a clear message to Berlin, guaranteeing that they understand that Britain won't sit idly while the balance of power is broken like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800817;\n\nWhile our government has experienced relative stability despite the Springtime of Nations happening in Europe, we got worrying news of a war breaking between Berlin and Copenhagen. Much to our dismay, such a war is guaranteed to break the balance of power in the Baltic Sea, with Denmark being annexed into Germany in the worst of cases. While we have no real obligation to help Denmark, not only the Danish a cade of our royal line, but their defeat would threaten our passage through the Øresund, be it by having the strait falling under the control of Berlin or by Denmark resorting to closer tier with Sweden after such a defeat. \n\nIt is clear that we must stop Berlin at once! We shall leave a very clear message by sending our fleet to the region and sending a letter directly to Berlin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800818;\n\nAs the war rages on, it became clear that our advances have been met with resistance from the other European powers. Not only has Sweden sent soldiers to aid Denmark and defend Fyn from us, but both Britain and Russia also sent their navy to send us a message. While we could take this as empty shows of force, Russia in particular has sent a message directly to Berlin, demanding a truce and a settlement for peace mediated by the other great powers. \n\nWhile it is bothersome to have other powers meddling in our affairs, we can't say this government was very enthusiastic about the war in the first place. Maybe it is for the best that we back down, especially now that the liberal agitation that drove us into war has calmed down.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
EVTDESC800819;\n\nAs the war against the German Confederation rages on, we were pleased to learn that we have received support from Russia, Great Britain, and even Sweden! It seems the European powers agree that it is for the best that we retain Schleswig-Holstein, and they have pressured Berlin into backing down—prompting the German Confederation to offer us peace. \n\nNegotiations in London have been tense, but we managed to reach a somewhat acceptable treaty. While Schleswig is to remain administratively separate from us and unified with Holstein, both fiefdoms will at least be united under a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark, rather than under the Oldenburg line. This ensures that they would not be separated from us in the event of a succession crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800820;\n\nIt seems that $FROMCOUNTRY$ isn't moved by our threats. The only option we have left to guarantee the balance of power in Europe is to fight them to save the Danish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800821;\n\nWe were victorious in defeating the pretenders in Schleswig-Holstein, despite support from the German confederation. We shall impose our new constitution and unite Schleswig with Denmark once and for all, while also keeping Holstein as a vassal and a buffer against the German Confederation, depriving them of the important port of Kiel and punishing them from meddling in Danish affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800822;\n\nPrince Frederick’s bid for Schleswig-Holstein has been a success! Despite Denmark still claiming Schleswig as its own, our victory—along with support from Frankfurt—has allowed us to declare ourselves the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein: a full member of the German Confederation, free from Danish overlordship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800825;\n\nFollowing our new constitution, it seems that our violation of the London Protocol hasn't gone unnoticed. With Schleswig and Holstein being separated, the German Confederation felt justified in occupying Holstein, with Saxon and Hannoverian troops taking control over the German fiefdom. While we can't be sure, it is pretty likely that we will once again find ourselves at war with Prussia and maybe even Austria this time. We better prepare for the worst as we see how the situation develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800826;\n\nFollowing Denmark's violation of the London Protocol, the German Confederation has ordered the occupation of Holstein, with Saxony and Hannover taking over the fiefdom for the time being. The current arrangement is obviously just a temporary measure, with the German Confederation asking that we once again come to the aid of Holstein. \n\nLast time our government wasn't very keen on the ideia of an unified Germany. But now, things changed and the violation of the London Protocol could ensure us that Britain wouldn't intervine this time, especially if we get the support of Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800827;\n\nFollowing Denmark's violation of the London Protocol, the German Confederation has ordered the occupation of Holstein, with Saxony and Hannover taking over the fiefdom for the time being. The current arrangement is obviously just a temporary measure, with the German Confederation asking that we once again come to the aid of Holstein. \n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has already expressed its intentions of coming to the aid of Holstein, calling us jointly support Holstein, in order to free Schleswig from Danish rule. Doing so would obviously increase relations with our German allies and recover some of our prestige as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800828;\n\nUnsurprisingly, after a tense week of waiting, the German Confederation has demanded that we withdraw from Schleswig, or else have to face the might of Austria and Prussia. While the situation seems even worse than in 1848, we can't afford to back down, seeing that it would instanly throw our country into chaos, with the new constitution becoming null and void in a second.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
