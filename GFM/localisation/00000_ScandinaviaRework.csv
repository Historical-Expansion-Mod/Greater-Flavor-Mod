liberate_finland_desc;§RGain 7 infamy§! As part of the Napoleonic Wars, we fought the Russians in the Finnish War, from early 1808 to late 1809, resulting in the loss of Finland and the nail in the coffin to Sweden's position as a great power in Europe, even after their union with Norway in 1814. Now, with our status restored, it is time for us to right this wrong and liberate Finland from the Russian yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800807;\n\nWe have long been observing the developments in Scandinavia, with the consolidation of an Scandinavian power, it is only natural that we would stand ready for its interest on our lands. It seems that it was only a matter of time for our suspicions to be proved true, as today an envoy from the west came with a offer: We can either swear fealty to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and they will protect us from Russian retaliation or we can remain under Russian overlordship and be "liberated" by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800808;\n\nWe have long been observing the developments in Scandinavia, with the consolidation of an Scandinavian power, it is only natural that we would stand ready for its interest on our lands. It seems that it was only a matter of time for our suspicions to be proved true, as we just recieve the news that our officials in Helsinki have been arrested and Finland has declared themselves free from the Russian rule, with support from our Scandinavian neighbours. It seems that the only option left is to once again fight for control over Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800809;\n\nAfter a series of impressive victories against Russia, the Russian Bear has finally agreed to sit at the negotiation table and hear our demands. While we haven’t yet finalized what our demands will be, we already have a solid idea of what exactly we intend to take from Russia. \n\nFirst, the most conservative option would be to restore the 1808 borders and use this as a basis for a treaty of friendship with Russia — guaranteeing their passage through the Øresund while not renouncing any future claims on their territory. The most popular proposal, on the other hand, would be to demand the entirety of the Grand Duchy of Finland.And last but not least, the most radical option would be to take all of Finland and Karelia as well, significantly shortening our border with Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800810;\n\nWhile we were defeated in the Second Finnish War, upon seeing our enemies demands we were pleseantly surprised in seeing that they are quite generous. Not only they intend on restoring the 1808 borders, but they also offered us a treaty of eternal friendship, that would not only turn us into allies, but also prevent any future claims on us and ensure our acces through the Øresund. While some advisors hold ressentment towards $FROMCOUNTRY$, we can't deny that the best option would be to swallow our pride and accept the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800811;\n\nWith our victory over Russia, Finland is firmly under our control and its fate lies in our hands. It is only natural that, following the end of the war, the place of Finland in our nation would start to be debated. It is clear that this could go one of two ways, with either Finland being entirely integrated into our nation or being granted a certain degree of autonomy, similar to what they had under Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800812;\n\nWhile Karelia wasn't in our initial plans, during our war against Russia, we counted with the support of Karelian insurgents and auxiliaries. After the war, we obviously couldn't leave them in Russian hands, annexing Karelia to ensure that Russia woudln't retaliate against them after our withdrawal from the region. Now the question stands, do we integrate them or do we set up a military government in the region so they can govern themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800812;\n\nDespite Scandinavian aggression against us, we managed to win the Second Finnish War, securing our control over Finland. Now we must decide what to do with the defeated aggressors. Naturally, we will integrate Finland to ensure that such a conflict never happens again, but some of our advisors have expressed interest in acquiring additional territory — such as Finnmark, which, despite its Arctic location, would serve as a warm-water port for us, and the islands of Gotland and Bornholm, which would both strengthen our presence in the Baltic Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SWE_purchase_guadeloupe_title;The Guadeloupe Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;
SWE_purchase_guadeloupe_desc;During the Napoleonic Wars the british transfered control of Guadeloupe to us as compensation for the lands Charles XIV John gave up to become the swedish king. After barely more than a year of swedish rule it was traded it back to the french in exchange for a yearly payment by the british to the swedish monarchy. It is time we try to regain the island, its strategic value is more important to us than some meek payment by the british.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310001;Sweden seeks to buy Guadeloupe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310001;\n\nThe Swedish government has approached us with an offer to buy the caribbean island of guadeloupe from us. This would mean we lose a strategically important part of our caribbean in exchange for a well needed cash infusion. Should we accept this peculiar offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310001;Why not, Guadeloupe isnt particularly valuable to us anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19310001;Absolutely not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310002;The French accept our offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310002;\n\nThe lovely government in paris has agreed to the purchase and will transfer control of the island to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310002;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310003;The French decline our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310003;\n\nThose frog-eaters in paris declined our offer. Quite sad however there really isnt much we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310003;Well then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19310004;The British withdraw the Guadeloupe Fund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19310004;\n\nAs somewhat expected, the british parlaiment has decided to withdraw the Guadeloupe fund. Given that the payments were reparations for us not owning the island, they see it fit that since we now own the island, they dont need to pay. This will most likely hit the lifestyle of the monarchy a little bit, but its nothing the income from our new colony cant make up for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19310004;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
