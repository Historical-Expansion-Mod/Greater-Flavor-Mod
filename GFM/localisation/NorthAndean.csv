icaza_pritchett_convenio_desc;§RRestart cores conflict with Peru§! During its war of independence from Spain, the government of Gran Colombia had incurred a number of debts to private European creditors. Its three daughter states: Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, split the debts amongst themselves. Recently a committee of European investors into Ecuador, the Ecuador Land Company, has organized itself and sent several representatives to discuss settling the debt. George S. Pritchett, one of these representatives, has offered a contract to our Minister of Finance, Francisco de Paula Icaza, giving creditors rights to several territories in the East of the nation. Our sovereignty over the lands would be preserved, though the territories would be tax-exempt for 15 years. Among the lands to be transferred by the Icaza–Pritchett contract are many territories in dispute with Peru, who decry the treaty as a violation of their integrity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_peruvian_ecuadorian_war_desc;The Ecuadorians have remained persistent in the obstinance. Very well! We have already given our president, General Ramón Castilla the right to command an army to recover our land and abrogate its sale to the creditors, and we shall supplement this with a blockade of Ecuador’s ports to bring them to their knees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_colombian_ecuadorian_union_desc;We won the war against our enemies despite all odds and the dreams of creating Bolivar’s Gran Colombia have appeared among our circles once again. While our liberal government has stark differences from Moreno’s conservative, almost theocratic government in Ecuador, we can come to a common ground if we start the negotiations. We can also use the argument that the conservatives during the Civil War forced a disgracing treaty on them, giving concessions if we have to. United we will stand against the enemies of South America!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_pinsaqui_title;Treaty of Pinsaqui;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_pinsaqui_desc;We won the battle against our enemies, therefore using our military and psychological advantage, we will take our claimed territories and make sure their claims over these territories will be annulled. This way, no conflict over these lands will happen again, and hopefully intimidate the opposite side from ever trying to take our lands ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

union_with_venezuela_desc;We were victorious in our attempt to subdue Ecuador; our dreams of Bolivar’s empire are coming closer and closer to reality! However, our military triumphs must be accompanied by political victories, and that’s why we will propose a union between our government and Venezuela. We need to make sure that the deal is fair and acceptable to the other side, but in the end, it is their decision to accept or refuse our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_maracaibo_desc;We won the war against tyrannical Colombians who tried to claim our country in the name of a great leader who passed away a long time ago. This opportunist act shall not go unpunished as we will take our claimed territories as well as demand the withdrawal of Colombian presence from Ecuador with a treaty. Their rampage will be subsumed and democracy restored in Ecuador once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

treaty_of_buenos_aires_desc;We drove our enemies out from the Chaco Region and now we reserve the right, and the arms to enforce our claims and occupy the area once and for all. The oil in the area, if we will find a considerable amount, will help tremendously to recover from the debts and losses we garnered. However, we have to give concessions to our foes as they still hold some claims on the Chaco region, and completely humiliating them in peace deals will bring further resentment to our government from Bolivians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197070;\n\nNews have reached from the city of Guayaquil us that a group of nationalits rebels seemingly being lead by Vicente Ramon Roca, Diego Noboa, Jose Joaquin de Olmedo and surprisingly one of our generals Antonio Elizalde have stared a rebelion to topple our goverment and to rectify the constitution of 1843 know to them as the "Carta de la Esclavitud".This has been the first revolution since our country's creation in 1830.Now the question is will it succeed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197071;\n\nAfter becoming Vice President of Vicente Ramón Roca in 1847. Manuel de Ascazubi came to presidency after concluding the constitutional period of Vicente Ramón Roca in 1849, and the technical draw in the presidential elections that did not decide between Antonio Elizalde and Diego Noboa y Arteta. Now after a popular assembly summoned by general Jose Maria has elected Diego Noboa as Chief Supreme the goverment in Quito have made Ascazubi quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197072;\n\n5 years after the March Revolution had deposed Juan José Flores for his increasing centralization of the state, conservative president Diego Noboa allowed the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, back into Ecuador after their expulsion from New Spain in 1767. The liberal president of New Granada, José Hilario López, feared that the Ecuadorian Jesuits would support the conservatives who conspired against him. Upon learning that Noboa had helped two of these conspirators in the city of Pasto, López was authorized to declare war on Ecuador. Under this pretext President Diego Noboa was granted emergency powers. As Ecuador prepared for war, General José María Urvina and the army staged a coup, worried that the president had similar ambitions of centralization as the founder of the republic, Juan José Flores. With Diego Noboa banished to Peru after the successful takeover, Supreme Chief José María Urvina has been sworn into office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197073;\n\nDuring its war of independence from Spain, the government of Gran Colombia had incurred a number of debts to private European creditors. Its three daughter states: Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, split the debts amongst themselves. In order to help settle these debts, Ecuador has signed a contract with European investors, giving them privileged access to certain lands North of Marañón and Amazon rivers - lands that are rightfully ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197074;\n\nEver since our independence, our northern territory has been disputed among our neighbors and now Ecuador has leased our land to the Englishmen. Perhaps it's time to invite the Ecuadorians to finally solve our border issue and call for suspension of the Icaza–Pritchett Agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197075;\n\nDuring the ongoing issue of the contract made with the Englishmen, words have came from New Granada about a dispatch made between the Peruvian Foreign Minister of Ecuador "Juan Celestino Cavero" and Peru, about a future invasion to Guayaquil, when we asked Cavero for an explanation about this dispatch, he remained silent, what should we do about Cavero?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197076;\n\nOur government is in a tricky situation. The debt we owe to the British has come to the point of crippling our government. When we tried to sell our claimed land in the Amazon Basin, this seriously angered the conservatives led by Gabriel García Moreno in our government. There will be no one helping us in our struggle, we will either win or disappear in the books of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197077;\n\nDuring the civil war in the Granadan Confederation (today’s Colombia), a border conflict took place in Tulcán where Ecuadorian and conservative forces fought with each other. The President of Ecuador also participated in this battle, but to his dismay, his forces scattered and even faced gunfire from his fellow soldiers in the confusion. This short battle resulted in a humiliating treaty forced on Ecuadorians, however, the Ecuadorian parliament would nullify the treaty as the constitution forbade the country from aiding civil wars in Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197078;\n\nThe liberals from Colombia came to us with an offer. They are trying to reinstall the old “Gran Colombia” of the old times. This preposterous offer has been criticized in Ecuador a lot, the differences between us are far too wide, we are religious while they are not, and their government is still suffering from civil war. Still, we may have to sacrifice one thing or two if we want to achieve the greatness of the old Colombia Bolivar. We have decided to…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197079;\n\nSince the dissolution of Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, our northern neighbors and we had claims over Gran Chaco. Their sole claim to the area is that Spanish granted them this territory on a now hundreds of years old defunct treaty, and after the war against Chile in the Pacific War, they turned their eyes on the areas we control. They were busy with their own internal affairs and other enemies, so they left the region alone up until a few years ago. Even though we consolidated our holdings in most of the region, this did not faze them from sending oil companies as a result of finding oil in the region. While we are not sure how much oil resides in Gran Chaco, they are dead set on deciding this dispute once and for all with a war led by an experienced German commander. We must mobilize our armies to face this swollen enemy and throw them once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198071;\n\nAfter the victory of the rebels in Guayaquil, the government repressions began, leading to several clashes throughout our country. The most notable of all the movements against Flores was one started in Manabí by José María Urbina. After President Juan José Flores entrenched himself in his hacienda "La Elvira", on the outskirts of Babahoyo, while his troops were led by Tomás Carlos Wright. The hacienda became the fort for the combats against the revolutionaries led by Elizalde, who in the first two confrontations suffered defeats, however, they have now finally defeated the government forces with the support of Urbina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198072;\n\nNow that Flores has been forced to capitulated in the "La Virginia" farm, owned by Joaquin de Olmedo, the Marcist goverment has enforced the "Tratados de la Virginia" The agreement says that no person could be disturbed for their past opinions, nor for the services they had rendered to the belligerents and in addition, the rank of "General en Jefe" would continue to be preserved for Flores, in addition 20,000 pesos would be granted to him so that he can subsist in Europe for a period of two years. These agreements shall mark the end of the revolution, of Floreanism, and the beginning of a new political stage for Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198073;\n\nAngered by the terms of the Icaza–Pritchett contract, Peruvian diplomats call for the agreement to be voided, reiterating their claims on the lands north of Marañón and Amazon rivers - lands that are rightfully ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198074;\n\nAfter the protest of Peru over the Icaza-Pritchett Contract, the Peruvian Foreign Minister of Ecuador Juan Celestino Cavero has asked us to negotiate. They want the suspension of the contract and to establish a new border treaty that can put an end to our border issue, shall we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198075;\n\nEcuador has sent us a delegation about the new border treaty proposition, they have accepted to sign a new border treaty. However, they flatly refused to suspend the deal with the Englishmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198076;\n\nJuan Celestino Cavero who is the Peruvian Foreign Minister of Ecuador, arrived to Lima recently after being expelled from Ecuador after a lousy rumor about plans of a future Invasion to Guayaquil, the Ecuadorian government asked him for an explanation that Cavero couldn't give to him, so he was banned and eventually expelled. Our government has already sent an Ultimatum to Ecuador, ordering the reinstauration of Cavero as the Peruvian foreign minister of Ecuador once again, but the Ecuadorian government in the end, decided to reject this Ultimatum, making very clear that Ecuador no longer wants to cooperate and breaking relationship with us, the only way this issue can be solved, it's by war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198077;\n\nDuring its war of independence from Spain, the government of Gran Colombia had incurred a number of debts to private European creditors. Its three daughter states: Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, split the debts amongst themselves. Recently a committee of holders of Latin American bonds has organized itself and sent several representatives to discuss settling the debt. George S. Pritchett, representing the one of these companies, signed a treaty with Ecuadorian Minister of Finance Francisco de Paula Icaza, giving creditors rights to several territories in the East of the nation. Ecuadorian sovereignty over the lands shall be preserved, though the territories are tax-exempt for 15 years. Among the lands transferred by the Icaza–Pritchett treaty are many territories in dispute with Peru, who decry the treaty as a violation of their integrity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198080;\n\nWe won the war against the Ecuadorians and reclaimed our rightful territories in the Amazon Basin which they tried to sell to Britain. Their political instability also helped us to achieve our goal more easily. Their armies never stood a chance against our heroic warriors! This will teach others to not mess with us ever again! Peru will be a force to be reckoned with in South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198082;\n\nThe Ecuadorian Civil War was a conflict that lasted a year between liberal Francisco Robles who controlled the government and conservative rebels led by Gabriel García Moreno. It was exasperated by the conservatives being supplied by invading Peruvian forces who wanted to increase their influence in the region and press their claims on the Amazon Basin. The Conservative government won the conflict in the end, albeit with severe losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198083;\n\nAfter the expulsion of liberal government from Quito, all of our influence on the region disappeared. García Moreno used the treaty we signed with liberals as a justification for their legitimacy to govern, and their bet paid off. Now that they consolidated their control, they also declared the treaty null on the basis that Ecuador was not unified during the war, and the usurper only used this treaty for opportunity. It would be best to avoid this issue from now on before we shame ourselves in front of our people even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198084;\n\nNot only did the Ecuadorians reject the treaty, but even the mention of it was said to anger Moreno so much that they sent an army to invade us and settle this dispute once and for all. They claimed we were interfering with their internal affairs again and mobilizing their troops in a crusade to defeat us as the defenders of the Catholic faith. Casting aside how nonsensical their opinions are, we must prepare for the upcoming war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198085;\n\nWhen the petty Ecuadorian dictator Garcia Moreno entered into a conflict with us, they did not know what they had put themselves into. Our defenders of liberty have destroyed the clerical dictatorship in the South. The suppression of the people went too far and we had no choice but to liberate them. Now that we are victorious, we will make sure no one will suppress the people in the name of God and his Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198086;\n\nThe liberals at New Granada made a horrible mistake by choosing to be our enemies and interfering with our internal affairs. However, God willing, we have defeated them, ensuring that the irreligious will not suppress the Christians in Ecuador. While our enemies shiver, our friends are proud.  We will demand compensation as well as take our claimed territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198087;\n\nOur neighbor Colombia approached us with an interesting proposal. We had territorial disputes for a long time and they are seeking to solve this by sharing the border between the Napo and the Putumayo Rivers. While we can agree to this proposal and resolve our long-running disputes once and for all, some of our politicians see this as an act of submission to Colombians. We can agree and forget about this forever, or refuse and find a way to get our claims via force in the future. The choice is up to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198088;\n\nOur neighbors from the north approached us with a troubling offer. According to them, we will lose control of a massive region in the Amazonas to give them a beachhead to settle and benefit from it. The border will be drawn in the Putumayo River which means a shaking loss for us. However, they will recognize our territorial claims in Ecuador and even let us establish an enclave in the region. They are also propped up by the USA which puts us at a bigger disadvantage. If we refuse, we will fall out with the USA and even with our other neighbors. If we will accept, we will have leverage over Ecuador to settle our forces forcefully if we have to. The choice is up to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198090;\n\nIt seems are facing an unexpected invasion of Colombia at the city of Leticia, a small town that was controlled by us after years severals hardships to consolidate control over it. Colombians Civilians under their government's support, launched an invasion and successfully ocupied Leticia expecting we wouldn't fight back, of course they thought wrong as we prepare for war making the tensions between our nations sparks in an unexpected war between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198091;\n\nThe President Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro of Peru attended a military review in Lima at the Santa Beatriz racetrack. As he standed watching the military parade, a crowd of supporters and military personnel surrounded him. In the midst of the event, a young man, Abelardo Mendoza Leyva, approached the president. Without warning, Mendoza draws a revolver and fires several shots at Sánchez Cerro. The president falls to the ground, gravely wounded, and chaos erupts around him. His security detail and nearby soldiers immediately react, but it was too late to save him. Mendoza is immediately shot and killed by the president’s security forces. President Sánchez Cerro is rushed to the hospital but dies shortly after from his wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198092;\n\nFollowing the assassination of President Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro in April 1933, Peru decides to shift its stance in the ongoing conflict with us, which had erupted in 1932 over territorial disputes in the Amazon region. The new president, General Óscar R. Benavides, takes power and seeks to stabilize the country, which is already struggling with internal divisions and political unrest. Benavides recognizes the need to de-escalate the conflict with us in order to focus on domestic issues. Diplomatic negotiations between Peru and us intensify, and international pressure, particularly from the League of Nations, urges both countries to find a peaceful solution. Peru, under Benavides' leadership, chooses to prioritize diplomacy over military confrontation and Peru begins to withdraw its forces from the disputed region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198093;\n\nAfter months of tension and armed clashes over the Amazonian town of Leticia, we find ourselves in a strong position to negotiate, especially after the assassination of Peru’s President Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro, which shifts their focus toward internal stability. With General Óscar R. Benavides now leading Peru, we see an opportunity to push for a peaceful settlement. International pressure, especially from the League of Nations, urges both countries to avoid further conflict, and in Rio de Janeiro, with mediation by Brazil and support from the United States and Argentina, we sit down with Peru to formalize an end to hostilities. Through the protocol, we secure control of the Leticia region, which had sparked the conflict, while Peru agrees to withdraw its claim over the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198094;\n\nAfter the assassination of President Sánchez Cerro, our focus shifts to internal stability under the leadership of General Óscar R. Benavides. Recognizing the need for peace, we agree to enter negotiations, encouraged by the League of Nations and international mediators. Through the protocol, we consent to withdraw our claim over Leticia, while Colombia secures the region. The agreement ends hostilities and commits us to resolving future disputes through diplomatic channels, promoting stability in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198095;\n\nThe enemies in the south finally unleashed their wrath upon our innocent border guards in the front. One of the border clashes between our troops in Chaco got out of hand, and they started mobilizing on us as a result of the ordeal. Their troops may outnumber us, but these masses remind a commoner of feudal-age peasant levies rather than an actual army. We are less, but more experienced and flexible. In the modern age we live now, it is more important to have a small but professional army than giving everyone a gun and sending them to their death. Still, we will see who wins on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC198096;\n\nAs we seek to finalize the territorial disputes with $FROMCOUNTRY$ after the devastating Chaco War. At the negotiations in Buenos Aires, we agree to cede much of the disputed Gran Chaco territory to $FROMCOUNTRY$. The treaty ensures that we retain access to the Paraguay River, giving us an outlet for trade and navigation, which is vital for our future development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC832025;\n\nWe had a dream of reclaiming our sister republics and ushering in a new age of prosperity and glory in South America. That dream is gone forever as we are forced into a treaty by our victors to release Ecuador and give concessions to our enemies. Perhaps it is time to break with the past and consolidate what we have at hand. The dream of Gran Colombia is over, for all we know, it may never be rekindled again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC832024;\n\nWe have won the day, neither petty oligarchs in Venezuela nor the priests in Ecuador stood on our way. Far from being a distant dream, United States of Colombia stands tall and her head looking forward to manifest her destiny. There will be obstacles on our way, from inside and outside, but every citizen will work for the betterment of the country to bring the golden age she deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC832023;\n\nBlinded by their victory in Ecuador, the Colombian dictator declared war on us to ensure our "union" between two nations. Should we fall, our fatherland will be the victim of vultures who use the name of Bolivar to further their own agenda. We will either defeat Colombians here, or fall under their thumb like Ecuadorians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC832022;\n\nVenezuelans have accepted our offer to unite our countries for the great destiny of Bolivar once again! We have the resources and the power to rebuild Gran Colombia to reshape our destiny, rid of corruption and clergy. May our empire prosper and build itself to be a formidable force in South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC832021;\n\nPetty Venezuelans refused our offer just because they wanted to hold to a small grasp of power! This act of insolence at the last moment should not go unpunished! At this moment, we must decide if we will enforce this union by force or give up our pursuit of building the empire we were so close to until now. However, there is something else to consider: If we declare war and lose the war, our enemies, external and internal will have the courage to rise against us. We will either hold on to what we have or take the risk for a great payoff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC832020;\n\nOur neighbor Colombia approached us with an interesting offer. They wish for our countries to be united under one banner to revive the dreams of Bolivar once again. While they have their reasons for the unification, we have our reasons to refuse it. Our hold on power will be at risk as they can abuse their power. We can either accept this on the road to building the destiny of Bolivar’s Empire or refuse to consolidate our power and ruin the dreams of Colombians once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC197080;\n\nIn a clear act of Imperialism, the Peruvian Government has claimed Guayaquil once again, which is a violation of the Treaty of Guayaquil in 1829.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199075;\n\nEcuador has sent us a delegation about the new border treaty proposition, they have accepted to remove any deal with the British private investors and to sign a new border treaty with us. However, in the end neither side could agree in a new border, so they called for the border issue to be solved in a future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199080;\n\nDespite the ongoing civil strife in our country, we have stood against the common enemy, Peru, and destroyed them with no chance to recover. Our small but formidable armies prevailed over a nation that was many times bigger than us, proving to everyone to think twice before declaring war on us. Our people are overjoyed with the news, reminding us to stay strong in dark times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199082;\n\nAgainst all odds, we won against the conservatives in our struggle to control the country. Even though this needless ruined the country for the future, we can at least start the negotiations with the British to alleviate some pressure off of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199083;\n\nWe have received the horrible news that liberals have aligned themselves with Peruvians for support in exchange for giving whatever they wanted. This is the highest treason to our fatherland and another reason for people to unite under us to expel these traitors from our fatherland. If we want to control the integrity of our lands, we have to win this war, for we have no other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199084;\n\nWe thought this proposal would be dead on arrival, therefore when Moreno accepted the proposal it shocked everyone. People did not expect an Ecuador led by a devout Catholic to join our country. Even they must have realized the potential to bring the legacy of Bolivar back!  Neither the Pope nor Peruvians will stop us from achieving our dreams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199085;\n\nWe have lost the war and $FROMCOUNTRY$ has forced us to comply with their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199087;\n\nOur negotiations with Ecuador proved to be successful, putting two brother countries closer to each other than ever. This will open further negotiations with other countries, proving that we are willing to sit down and talk about our problems rather than bullying countries to submission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199088;\n\nOur brothers in the south accepted our offer, rekindling the friendship between the future countries for years to come. In exchange for gaining land for our country, we recognized the Peruvian claims over the Ecuadorian-controlled Amazon regions and even granted them a new enclave as we made it clear in the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199089;\n\nWe tried our best to appease the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, but they were not willing to accept other than complete secession of the territory. This is unacceptable, damaging our domestic and foreign relationships. Some even say force of arms must be considered to undo the humiliation we had to endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199090;\n\nIt seems are facing an unexpected invasion of Peru at the city of Leticia, a small town that was handed to us under the he Salomón-Lozano Treaty of 1922. Peruvians Civilians under their government's support, launched an invasion and successfully ocupied Leticia expecting we wouldn't fight back, of course they thought wrong as we prepare for war making the tensions between our nations sparks in an unexpected war between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199091;\n\nIn 1933, after the assassination of President Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro, General Óscar R. Benavides, assume leadership of Peru during a time of deep political unrest and external conflict. The country is divided, and the war with Colombia over the Leticia region escalates, putting strain on our military and resources. Our priority is to restore stability and prevent further internal chaos, but we must also decide the fate of the ongoing war. Now, as we face both domestic and international pressures, should we continue the war with Colombia, or is it time to pursue a ceasefire and negotiate peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199092;\n\nDespite our willingness to negotiate, Colombia, driven by military pressure and nationalism, chooses to continue fighting, escalating hostilities in the contested Leticia region. As the war drags on, we face mounting casualties and economic strain. Colombia seeks to solidify its control over Leticia and dismisses international calls for peace, forcing us to mobilize more forces despite our internal instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199095;\n\nSouth America is known to its residents where countries waged numerous wars with each other for border conflicts that were left to them as a gift from their colonial overlords. This is the reason why, when the $FROMCOUNTRY$ announced their withdrawal from the Chaco Region after various standoffs with their northern rivals, it left everyone puzzled. Still, the people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are enraged with this news. The cowardice of the current government will certainly leave a bad taste in the mouth, and disgruntled officers might try to depose the government with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199096;\n\nOur neighbors have been fighting for the Chaco Region for some time. When the guns were finally silenced and the soldiers halted, both sides looked for a neutral country to settle the dispute once and for all. We have common grounds with both of the countries and this will show our goodwill to everyone in South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC298079;\n\nWe got the news of Colombians and Peru signing a treaty of territorial exchange in Bogota. Colombia allied with Peru and recognized their Amazon claim in our land. We must be aware of the escalating tensions that might arise in upcoming years, and prepare for a potential conflict to enforce their claims over us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC298080;\n\nAfter our independence, the borders between New Granada and us has not been yet properly defined. Now colombia proposes us to sign a border treaty, this treaty represents our effort to establish clearer borders and foster peace between our nations. In negotiations, we agree to define our boundaries more explicitly, particularly in the eastern regions. This accord helps to ease tensions that have arisen from overlapping claims, allowing us to focus on rebuilding and strengthening our nation, but we will be giving up most of our claims on Colombia and Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC298083;\n\nWe find ourselves facing controversy over the Michelena-Pombo Treaty with New Granada. Although the treaty was meant to clarify our borders and promote peace, it sparks tensions as we believe our interpretation of the boundaries does not align with the agreement's intentions. We assert that the treaty establishes clear territorial lines, but New Granada disputes our understanding, claiming it encroaches on their sovereignty. In response to this growing tension, we demand a renegotiation of the treaty, seeking adjustments that would better protect our national interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC298084;\n\nWe find ourselves embroiled in controversy over the Michelena-Pombo Treaty with Venezuela. Although the treaty was intended to clarify our borders and promote peace, tensions arise as we believe that Venezuela's interpretation does not reflect the agreement's true intentions. Venezuela asserts that our understanding of the boundaries encroaches on their sovereignty, and they call for a renegotiation of the treaty. This demand sparks public outcry and nationalistic fervor within our borders, as many of us feel that our territorial claims are being undermined. As our diplomatic relations deteriorate, we remain firm in our position, believing that we can establish another treaty with Venezuela in the future that can solve our border dispute once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3459011;\n\nEver since the colonial era, Panama and its regional culture has been vastly different from the rest of Colombia, with many of them not even feeling identified as Colombians but as a group different from the rest of Colombia. As we recognize the unique identity of the Panamanian people, we consider three options: to protect their cultural heritage, to force them to adopt a more Colombian identity, or to grant them greater autonomy. If we choose to protect Panamanian culture, we commit to fostering a sense of pride and collaboration, promoting their traditions while ensuring they feel valued within our nation. On the other hand, if we decide to enforce a more Colombian identity, we risk alienating the Panamanians, leading to resentment and potential unrest. Alternatively, granting them autonomy could strengthen our ties by allowing them to self-govern while still being part of Colombia. This approach might help balance national unity with regional pride. As we weigh these options, the future of our relationship with Panama hangs in the balance. What should we do to ensure harmony and respect for their identity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3459012;\n\nBy imposing Colombian customs, language, and educational curricula over the course of ten years. We created a sense of national identity among many Panamanians, as we invest in infrastructure and economic development in the region. Some citizens embrace Colombian culture, participating in national celebrations and adopting our customs. However, this approach also sparks resistance among others who feel their unique identity is being erased. Over time, underlying resentment builds, and cultural tensions flare as Panamanians struggle to reconcile their heritage with imposed Colombian norms.
