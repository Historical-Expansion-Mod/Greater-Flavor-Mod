The liberal president of New Granada, José Hilario López, feared that the Ecuadorian Jesuits would support the conservatives who conspired against him. Upon learning that Noboa had helped two of these conspirators in the city of Pasto, López was authorized to declare war on Ecuador. Under this pretext President Diego Noboa was granted emergency powers. As Ecuador prepared for war, General José María Urvina and the army staged a coup, worried that the president had similar ambitions of centralization as the founder of the republic, Juan José Flores.

Recently a committee of European investors into Ecuador, the Ecuador Land Company, has organized itself and sent several representatives to discuss settling the debt. George S. Pritchett, one of these representatives, has offered a contract to our Minister of Finance, Francisco de Paula Icaza, giving creditors rights to several territories in the East of the nation.

Our government has already sent an Ultimatum to Ecuador, ordering the reinstauration of Cavero as the Peruvian foreign minister of Ecuador once again, but the Ecuadorian government in the end, decided to reject this Ultimatum, making very clear that Ecuador no longer wants to cooperate and breaking relationship with us, the only way this issue can be solved, it's by war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
