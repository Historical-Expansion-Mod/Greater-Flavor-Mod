COPENHAGENCHOLERA;Doctors have been warning us for decades about the unsanitary conditions present in the city of Copenhagen. Garbage and excrement flows in the streets, families are cramped tight inside the city walls and drinking water is simply supplied via hollowed-out logs from surrounding lakes. Now, our worst fears have come to pass: A severe outbreak of cholera has occurred! Over 7000 infections have been reported, of which hundreds have already died. The death toll will surely rise into the thousands, as experience in other cities shows that roughly 65% of cholera victims do not survive the illness. Additional cases have been reported outside the city, causing fears of the disease spreading throughout the country..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOMBAYPLAGUEEPIDEMIC;In 1855, a new, deadly plague pandemic originated in Yunnan. Thankfully, it remained contained in that mountainous region for many decades, but in 1894 it finally reached Hong Kong. From there, it was only a matter of time until it reached India. Now, the first cases have been reported in the bustling city of Bombay. Due to the mortality rate of 80%, the disease has thoroughly terrified the populace, causing tens of thousands of people to flee the city for the countryside. Dr Acacio Gabriel Viega, the man who diagnosed the first plague victim in the city, has begun a vociferous campaign to clean up slums and exterminate rats, the carriers of the fleas which spread the plague bacterium. We can only hope that his measures will bear fruit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATFLOODPARIS;Last Winter, Paris and the surrounding area experienced higher than normal rainfall, saturating the ground and filling rivers. The Seine's water level rose and fell again in December, lulling the people into a false sense of security. Just a few days ago, Parisians were preoccupied with daily life and consequently ignored the warning signs, including reports of mudslides and flooding occurring upriver. Now, water has begun pushing upwards from overflowing sewers and subway tunnels, seeping into basements through fully saturated soil. Thousands of Parisians have evacuated their homes as water infiltrates buildings and streets throughout the city, shutting down much basic infrastructure. With the water a full 8.6m above its usual level, the costs of repairing the ensuing damage will surely be in the millions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BALTICSEAFLOOD;News of a devastating flood has reached us from the Baltic Sea Coast. In the past few days, a storm blew from the southwest across the Baltic that drove the sea towards Finland and Baltic States. The result was flooding there and extreme low water levels on the Danish-German coastlines. The storm increased in strength, and suddenly changed direction. Tremendous winds now blew from the northeast, driving the water masses back in a south-westerly direction. Because the water could only slowly flow back into the North Sea, huge waves caught coastal dwellers by surprise and caused floods over a metre high in coastal towns and villages. According to the latest reports, nearly 300 people have died, almost three thousand homes have been destroyed, hundreds of ships have sunk and an estimated ten thousand livestock have drowned. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATFLOODINUS;Major rivers in the central and eastern United States have flooded from runoff and several days of heavy rain. A couple days before the flood, a massive blizzard engulfed 20 states. Then, strong Canadian winds stalled a high-pressure system off Bermuda and delayed the normal easterly flow of two large successive low-pressure systems passing over the Midwest. For two days, 3 to 8 inches of rain have fallen in Ohio, Indiana, and southern Illinois. Major rivers in Indiana and Ohio have experienced heavy runoff exacerbated by rising temperatures melting the leftover snow. Downstream, where the Ohio River enters the Mississippi, the water level has broken record highs. Cities such as Indianapolis, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Youngstown, Dayton, and Columbus, Ohio have all experienced severe flooding, causing heavy damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATSHEFFIELDFLOOD;To satisfy the expanding city of Sheffield's growing need for clean water, the Sheffield Waterworks Company constructed the Dale Dyke Dam to hold a reservoir for the city's use. Last night, as the reservoir was being filled, the company's resident engineer, John Gunson, noticed a concerning crack in the dam's structure, but thought it wasn't dangerous. In the middle of the night, the dam collapsed, releasing 3 million cubic meters of water barrelling into the city. The centre of the town, situated on the hill to the south, has escaped damage, but the densely populated district of the Wicker, around the new railway viaduct, has been completely destroyed. In all, 238 people have died and some 700 animals have been drowned. 130 buildings have been wrecked and 500 partially damaged. 15 bridges have been swept away and six others badly damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FLOODINMISKOLC;Today, large storms coming from the Transdanubian region arrived in Northern Hungary -- first in Eger, next in Óhuta, Diósgyor and Miskolc, and then in Tállya, Golop and Mád. The rainfall swelled the streams Szinva and Pece, and destroyed the largest part of downtown Miskolc. The water has swept away bridges, mills and houses, carrying a large amount of debris. The water level rose by half a meter per minute, making it impossible for many people to escape. The water reached a depth of 4-5 meters in some parts of the city, destroying 2000 buildings and killing almost 300 people. Miskolc has a long history of floods, with major flooding occurring in 1691, 1788, 1813, 1845 and 1853. This is, however, by far the worst flood in the history of not just Miskolc but all of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHURCHOFTHECOMPANYFIRE;In Santiago de Chile's Church of the Company, the celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception was about to start when an oil lamp ignited some of the veils adorning the walls. The situation got worse when a strong gust of wind knocked a candle off the podium, starting a fire that roared through the church, resulting in its total destruction. Tragically, when the mostly female attendees panicked and tried to escape, they stampeded towards the main entrance as the side doors, which closed inwards, had been sealed in order to accommodate more people. The priests fled to the sacristy and closed its door, whereupon they gathered the church's valuables to save them. While the priests escaped unharmed, this prevented anyone from escaping through the sacristy after the door was closed. An incomprehensible 2500 people have died in the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1897ASSAMEARTHQUAKE;Last evening, a powerful earthquake devastated northeastern India from its epicenter in Assam. The earthquake has caused huge damage to infrastructure, with bridges collapsing, roads being made impassable by fissures, and railways bending and buckling. In Shillong, the earthquake has damaged every single stone house and half the houses built of wood. A landslide occurred in Sohra Cherrapunji, causing 600 deaths. In Goalpara, the earthquake caused massive waves from the Brahmaputra River to flood the town, destroying the market. In all, over 1500 people have lost their lives, having been buried in collapsing buildings, drowned by floods or even swallowed by fissures. The earthquake was so powerful that it caused damage in Calcutta and could even be felt as far as Gujarat and Peshawar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1889KUMAMOTOEARTHQUAKE;Last night, an earthquake struck the western part of Kumamoto on the island of Kyushu. Twenty people have died, hundreds of houses have been destroyed, and even parts of Kumamoto Castle have been damaged. Thankfully, because the earthquake occurred close to midnight, few houses had fires lit, meaning that, unlike after other earthquakes, no destructive blaze developed. The locals have now begun repairing the devastation caused by the earthquake. Notably, this is the first Japanese earthquake to have been captured by the newly introduced medium of photography, making pictures of the damage available in print throughout Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1880ATTEMPTASSASSINTSAR;An attempt has been made on the life of Tsar Alexander II! Last night, at dinnertime, a powerful explosion in the basement of the Winter Palace ripped all the way through the intervening floor and demolished the dining room. The royal family escaped unscathed due to a stroke of luck: A guest arriving from Berlin was delayed, meaning that dinner was delayed for the first time in years. The bomb exploded right as the family left the drawing room for the dining room, barely missing them. The explosion was so great that it could be heard all over Saint Petersburg. In the guard room above the basement, 11 members of the Finnish Guard were killed and a further 30 wounded. Investigations have uncovered that, to kill the Tsar, a member of the Narodnaya Volya terrorist organization working as a carpenter secretly placed dynamite in the basement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1850ATTEMPTASSASSINENG;Last evening, army officer Robert Francis Pate Jr. attempted to assassinate Queen Victoria. She had been visiting her dying uncle, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, at Cambridge House in Piccadilly. When her carriage left the courtyard, Pate hit the Queen on the head with the short feruled cane that he was carrying. The blow was heavy enough to crush her bonnet and draw a little blood. Pate was immediately arrested by sergeant James Silver and taken to Vine Street police station. The attack has left our monarch with a mark on her forhead, but she is thankfully in good health nonetheless. In court, Pate was charged with unlawfully and maliciously striking the Queen, alarming the Queen, and breach of the peace. He has been sentenced to seven years of penal transportation to Tasmania and will not be heard from again anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1905ATTEMPTASSASSINSULTAN;An attempt has been made on the life of our beloved sultan, Abdul Hamid II! As his carriage was passing in front of the Yildiz Hamidiye mosque, Zareh, a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, threw a bomb at him, killing many, including himself. Miraculously, the sultan escaped unharmed whilst over ninety others died. As Abdul Hamid II prays at the Yildiz Hamidiye mosque every Friday at the same time, the ARF terrorists planned to assassinate him by parking a carriage with a time bomb in it in front of the mosque, relying on the sultan's punctuality to time the explosion. Thankfully, Abdul Hamid II got caught up in a conversation with his Sheikh ul-Islam, Mehmet Cemaleddin Efendi, delaying his arrival and forcing Zareh to throw the bomb, presumably saving the sultan's life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ballot_act_of_seventy_two_title;The Ballot Act of 1872;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ballot_act_of_seventy_two_desc;Due to ballots not being secret, employers and landowners have been able to use their sway over employees and tenants to influence the vote, either by being present themselves or by sending representatives to check on the votes as they are being cast. Small retailers are also concerned not to upset their bigger customers by voting differently from them. To solve these problems, radicals, such as the Chartists, have long campaigned for the a secret ballot to be introduced. With the idea gaining ever more popularity, perhaps it is finally time to pass it into law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1898FIRSTASCENTOFKEBNEKAISE;Towering at a height of 2120m, Kebnekaise is the tallest mountain of Sweden. Lying in Swedish Lapland, about 150 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, the remote, majestic peak has long eluded mountaineers' grasp. Now, the mountain has finally been conquered by an expedition made up of Frenchman Charles Rabot, its leader, Jon Larsson, Hans Monsen and Pehr Abrahamsson. Setting out from from Elvegård in Skjomdalen, Norway, the hike to the foot of the mountain took them six days. After an arduous ascent, the victorious party finally reached the elusive peak at 7PM. Monsieur Rabot, highly celebrated for his impressive achievement of mountaineering, has published a book titled "Au Cap Nord", in which he describes the treacherous course of the expedition, bringing the fascination of distant peaks to the common man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
