COPENHAGENCHOLERA;\n\nDoctors have been warning us for decades about the unsanitary conditions present in the city of Copenhagen. Garbage and excrement flows in the streets, families are cramped tight inside the city walls and drinking water is simply supplied via hollowed-out logs from surrounding lakes. Now, our worst fears have come to pass: A severe outbreak of cholera has occurred! Over 7000 infections have been reported, of which hundreds have already died. The death toll will surely rise into the thousands, as experience in other cities shows that roughly 65% of cholera victims do not survive the illness. Additional cases have been reported outside the city, causing fears of the disease spreading throughout the country..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOMBAYPLAGUEEPIDEMIC;\n\nIn 1855, a new, deadly plague pandemic originated in Yunnan. Thankfully, it remained contained in that mountainous region for many decades, but in 1894 it finally reached Hong Kong. From there, it was only a matter of time until it reached India. Now, the first cases have been reported in the bustling city of Bombay. Due to the mortality rate of 80%, the disease has thoroughly terrified the populace, causing tens of thousands of people to flee the city for the countryside. Dr Acacio Gabriel Viega, the man who diagnosed the first plague victim in the city, has begun a vociferous campaign to clean up slums and exterminate rats, the carriers of the fleas which spread the plague bacterium. We can only hope that his measures will bear fruit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATFLOODPARIS;\n\nLast Winter, Paris and the surrounding area experienced higher than normal rainfall, saturating the ground and filling rivers. The Seine's water level rose and fell again in December, lulling the people into a false sense of security. Just a few days ago, Parisians were preoccupied with daily life and consequently ignored the warning signs, including reports of mudslides and flooding occurring upriver. Now, water has begun pushing upwards from overflowing sewers and subway tunnels, seeping into basements through fully saturated soil. Thousands of Parisians have evacuated their homes as water infiltrates buildings and streets throughout the city, shutting down much basic infrastructure. With the water a full 8.6m above its usual level, the costs of repairing the ensuing damage will surely be in the millions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BALTICSEAFLOOD;\n\nNews of a devastating flood has reached us from the Baltic Sea Coast. In the past few days, a storm blew from the southwest across the Baltic that drove the sea towards Finland and Baltic States. The result was flooding there and extreme low water levels on the Danish-German coastlines. The storm increased in strength, and suddenly changed direction. Tremendous winds now blew from the northeast, driving the water masses back in a south-westerly direction. Because the water could only slowly flow back into the North Sea, huge waves caught coastal dwellers by surprise and caused floods over a meter high in coastal towns and villages. According to the latest reports, nearly 300 people have died, almost three thousand homes have been destroyed, hundreds of ships have sunk and an estimated ten thousand livestock have drowned. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATFLOODINUS;\n\nMajor rivers in the central and eastern United States have flooded from runoff and several days of heavy rain. A couple days before the flood, a massive blizzard engulfed 20 states. Then, strong Canadian winds stalled a high-pressure system off Bermuda and delayed the normal easterly flow of two large successive low-pressure systems passing over the Midwest. For two days, 3 to 8 inches of rain have fallen in Ohio, Indiana, and southern Illinois. Major rivers in Indiana and Ohio have experienced heavy runoff exacerbated by rising temperatures melting the leftover snow. Downstream, where the Ohio River enters the Mississippi, the water level has broken record highs. Cities such as Indianapolis, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Youngstown, Dayton, and Columbus, Ohio have all experienced severe flooding, causing heavy damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATSHEFFIELDFLOOD;\n\nTo satisfy the expanding city of Sheffield's growing need for clean water, the Sheffield Waterworks Company constructed the Dale Dyke Dam to hold a reservoir for the city's use. Last night, as the reservoir was being filled, the company's resident engineer, John Gunson, noticed a concerning crack in the dam's structure, but thought it wasn't dangerous. In the middle of the night, the dam collapsed, releasing 3 million cubic meters of water barreling into the city. The center of the town, situated on the hill to the south, has escaped damage, but the densely populated district of the Wicker, around the new railway viaduct, has been completely destroyed. In all, 238 people have died and some 700 animals have been drowned. 130 buildings have been wrecked and 500 partially damaged. 15 bridges have been swept away and six others badly damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FLOODINMISKOLC;\n\nToday, large storms coming from the Transdanubian region arrived in Northern Hungary -- first in Eger, next in Óhuta, Diósgyor and Miskolc, and then in Tállya, Golop and Mád. The rainfall swelled the streams Szinva and Pece, and destroyed the largest part of downtown Miskolc. The water has swept away bridges, mills and houses, carrying a large amount of debris. The water level rose by half a meter per minute, making it impossible for many people to escape. The water reached a depth of 4-5 meters in some parts of the city, destroying 2000 buildings and killing almost 300 people. Miskolc has a long history of floods, with major flooding occurring in 1691, 1788, 1813, 1845 and 1853. This is, however, by far the worst flood in the history of not just Miskolc but all of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHURCHOFTHECOMPANYFIRE;\n\nIn Santiago de Chile's Church of the Company, the celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception was about to start when an oil lamp ignited some of the veils adorning the walls. The situation got worse when a strong gust of wind knocked a candle off the podium, starting a fire that roared through the church, resulting in its total destruction. Tragically, when the mostly female attendees panicked and tried to escape, they stampeded towards the main entrance as the side doors, which closed inwards, had been sealed in order to accommodate more people. The priests fled to the sacristy and closed its door, whereupon they gathered the church's valuables to save them. While the priests escaped unharmed, this prevented anyone from escaping through the sacristy after the door was closed. An incomprehensible 2500 people have died in the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1897ASSAMEARTHQUAKE;\n\nLast evening, a powerful earthquake devastated northeastern India from its epicenter in Assam. The earthquake has caused huge damage to infrastructure, with bridges collapsing, roads being made impassable by fissures, and railways bending and buckling. In Shillong, the earthquake has damaged every single stone house and half the houses built of wood. A landslide occurred in Sohra Cherrapunji, causing 600 deaths. In Goalpara, the earthquake caused massive waves from the Brahmaputra River to flood the town, destroying the market. In all, over 1500 people have lost their lives, having been buried in collapsing buildings, drowned by floods or even swallowed by fissures. The earthquake was so powerful that it caused damage in Calcutta and could even be felt as far as Gujarat and Peshawar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1889KUMAMOTOEARTHQUAKE;\n\nLast night, an earthquake struck the western part of Kumamoto on the island of Kyushu. Twenty people have died, hundreds of houses have been destroyed, and even parts of Kumamoto Castle have been damaged. Thankfully, because the earthquake occurred close to midnight, few houses had fires lit, meaning that, unlike after other earthquakes, no destructive blaze developed. The locals have now begun repairing the devastation caused by the earthquake. Notably, this is the first Japanese earthquake to have been captured by the newly introduced medium of photography, making pictures of the damage available in print throughout Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1880ATTEMPTASSASSINTSAR;\n\nAn attempt has been made on the life of Tsar Alexander II! Last night, at dinnertime, a powerful explosion in the basement of the Winter Palace ripped all the way through the intervening floor and demolished the dining room. The royal family escaped unscathed due to a stroke of luck: A guest arriving from Berlin was delayed, meaning that dinner was delayed for the first time in years. The bomb exploded right as the family left the drawing room for the dining room, barely missing them. The explosion was so great that it could be heard all over Saint Petersburg. In the guard room above the basement, 11 members of the Finnish Guard were killed and a further 30 wounded. Investigations have uncovered that, to kill the Tsar, a member of the Narodnaya Volya terrorist organization working as a carpenter secretly placed dynamite in the basement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1850ATTEMPTASSASSINENG;\n\nLast evening, army officer Robert Francis Pate Jr. attempted to assassinate Queen Victoria. She had been visiting her dying uncle, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, at Cambridge House in Piccadilly. When her carriage left the courtyard, Pate hit the Queen on the head with the short feruled cane that he was carrying. The blow was heavy enough to crush her bonnet and draw a little blood. Pate was immediately arrested by sergeant James Silver and taken to Vine Street police station. The attack has left our monarch with a mark on her forehead, but she is thankfully in good health nonetheless. In court, Pate was charged with unlawfully and maliciously striking the Queen, alarming the Queen, and breach of the peace. He has been sentenced to seven years of penal transportation to Tasmania and will not be heard from again anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1905ATTEMPTASSASSINSULTAN;\n\nAn attempt has been made on the life of our beloved sultan, Abdul Hamid II! As his carriage was passing in front of the Yildiz Hamidiye mosque, Zareh, a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, threw a bomb at him, killing many, including himself. Miraculously, the sultan escaped unharmed whilst over ninety others died. As Abdul Hamid II prays at the Yildiz Hamidiye mosque every Friday at the same time, the ARF terrorists planned to assassinate him by parking a carriage with a time bomb in it in front of the mosque, relying on the sultan's punctuality to time the explosion. Thankfully, Abdul Hamid II got caught up in a conversation with his Sheikh ul-Islam, Mehmet Cemaleddin Efendi, delaying his arrival and forcing Zareh to throw the bomb, presumably saving the sultan's life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ballot_act_of_seventy_two_title;The Ballot Act of 1872;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ballot_act_of_seventy_two_desc;Due to ballots not being secret, employers and landowners have been able to use their sway over employees and tenants to influence the vote, either by being present themselves or by sending representatives to check on the votes as they are being cast. Small retailers are also concerned not to upset their bigger customers by voting differently from them. To solve these problems, radicals, such as the Chartists, have long campaigned for the a secret ballot to be introduced. With the idea gaining ever more popularity, perhaps it is finally time to pass it into law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1898FIRSTASCENTOFKEBNEKAISE;\n\nTowering at a height of 2120m, Kebnekaise is the tallest mountain of Sweden. Lying in Swedish Lapland, about 150 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, the remote, majestic peak has long eluded mountaineers' grasp. Now, the mountain has finally been conquered by an expedition made up of Frenchman Charles Rabot, its leader, Jon Larsson, Hans Monsen and Pehr Abrahamsson. Setting out from from Elvegård in Skjomdalen, Norway, the hike to the foot of the mountain took them six days. After an arduous ascent, the victorious party finally reached the elusive peak at 7PM. Monsieur Rabot, highly celebrated for his impressive achievement of mountaineering, has published a book titled "Au Cap Nord", in which he describes the treacherous course of the expedition, bringing the fascination of distant peaks to the common man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLANTYREMININGDISASTER;\n\nThis morning, Scotland was hit by the worst mining accident in its recorded history. At 9:00 AM, a blast was heard coming from the Blantyre Colliery's number 3 pit, followed by flames and steam. Debris falling from the damaged shaft has clogged up the shaft, trapping over 200 miners within. The explosion was a consequence of buildup of firedamp, a dangerous, highly combustible gas found in coal deposits. Despite ventilation via the number 2 pit, the blockage combined with the fire have almost certainly caused a depletion of oxygen. At first, their voices and screams could be heard from above, but, now that they have faded, all hope for the miners' survival is lost. With so much blackdamp, a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen, having choked the mine, any rescue or salvage operation is unthinkable. It must be manually pumped out over the course of several days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AVONDALEMINEDISASTER;\n\nThe Avondale Colliery near Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania, has been befallen by a deeply tragic disaster. This morning, a coal breaker atop the mine's only entrance shaft caught fire. The flames grew rapidly, quickly setting most of the surrounding wooden structures alight. Thus, the miners were hopelessly trapped, with the flames gradually traveling through the shaft by burning wooden supports. With the oxygen being exhausted by the fire, all 108 miners died excruciating deaths by suffocation. Futile rescue attempts have turned into recovery missions as those sent into the mine after having put out the surrounding fires have themselves died, victims of the toxic blackdamp, a mixture of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen incapable of supporting life. If only the mine had had a second exit, perhaps everyone could have made it out alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HARTLEYCOLLIERYDISASTER;\n\nA horrific accident has taken place at the Hartley Colliery in Northumberland. The Hartley Pit, accessed by just one shaft, was prone to frequent flooding, necessitating the installation of the largest steam-driven pump employed in all of Britain. At 10:30 AM, as miners of the back shift were taking over from the fore shift, doubling the number of people in the mine, the pumping engine's beam suddenly snapped, falling down the shaft and jamming in its midst. Together with falling debris, this blocked the only way in and out of the mine. In multi-shaft mines, there is both a downcast and an upcast shaft, allowing air to flow in and out. In the Hartley Pit, a brattice, now destroyed by debris, was instead installed in the middle of the shaft to divide it into an up and downcast portion. Without air circulation, all 200 miners have now surely asphyxiated in the depths, never again to see the light of day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OAKSEXPLOSIONMINING;\n\nThe Oaks Colliery, located in West Riding of Yorkshire, has been devastated by a series of devastating explosions. Infamous for large emissions of firedamp, the Oaks is considered to be one of the most dangerous coal mines in all of England. Company inspectors are reported to have resorted to simply using chalk to write 'FIRE' on the walls of dangerous areas. Disaster first struck at 1:20 PM when 430 miners were working underground. An explosion ripped through the workings, shaking all land within three miles as if an earthquake had occurred, accompanied by a loud roar akin to thunder. Two dense columns of smoke and debris erupted from the shafts. While over 80 men have since been rescued, some have since died of their injuries. Additionally, nearly thirty would-be rescuers have themselves become victims of the blaze that has taken over the colliery. With over 300 dead, this is, no doubt, the worst mining disaster in English history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DRUMMONDMINEEXPLOSION;\n\nTragedy has struck Canada's largest mine, the Drummond Colliery. For years now, small fires have frequently erupted in the coal seams due to accumulations of firedamp, a dangerous gas. This morning, fireman Robert McLeod started a small, controlled fire with gunpowder on a ledge of coal to remove traces of firedamp. But when he attempted to extinguish it with a bucket of water, he found it impossible to put out. After 20 minutes and several buckets, he left and alerted the manager. Upon his return, the blaze had grown beyond control. He ran for safety, just as the first explosion occurred, around 12:15. With the force of a volcano, towers of flame spewed miners, timber, and rocks from all the mine entrances. In all, seventy miners are estimated to have been burned alive, suffocated or buried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SENGHENYDDCOLLIERYDISASTER;\n\nYesterday at 8:00 AM, a terrific explosion occurred at the Universal Colliery in Senghenydd, near Caerphilly, Glamorgan, Wales. At 3:00 AM that morning, company inspectors had descended into the pit to conduct daily checks for gas. Between having to travel more than two miles from the shaft bottom to the main workface and having only three hours, they could only do a rudimentary check for explosive gases using an open flame. Thus, a major buildup of firedamp went unnoticed and ignited in the morning, causing an immense explosion in combination with the coal dust spread throughout the mine. Rescuers were almost entirely powerless in the face of the resulting inferno. Reports liken the opening of the mineshaft to a huge furnace. The jaw-dropping death toll is estimated to exceed 400, but we will only know with certainty once the flames are extinguished, which will, no doubt, take weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_cobden_chevalier_treaty_title;The Cobden-Chevalier Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_cobden_chevalier_treaty_desc;Liberal statesman John Bright has proposed to MP Richard Cobden that, instead of spending money on armaments against a possible French invasion, the British government attempt instead to persuade France to trade freely with Britain. French engineer, statesman and economist Michel Chevalier has spoken out in favor of the treaty and believes that the French monarch can be convinced. By lifting our tariffs, we would increase trade substantially: British manufactured goods will flood into France, whilst French wine, silk and brandy will become widespread in Britain, all at a significantly cheaper price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COBDENCHEVALIERENDED;\n\nThe Cobden-Chevalier Treaty, previously responsible for reduced tariffs and increased trade between France and Great Britain, has declined due to a multitude of factors. With other powers increasing their tariffs, enthusiasm reducing over time, nationalism on the rise and Anglo-French relations cooling, it has been become evident that the treaty is now obsolete. Now, tariffs have returned to pre-treaty levels, and trade is sure to suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COBDENCHEVALIERDENIED;\n\nThe French have refused to sign the proposed treaty. A disappointing decision on their part, since its effects would have been mutually beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COBDENCHEVALIERACCEPTED;\n\nThe French government has readily agreed to our proposal, recognizing the value of a free trade agreement to both our economies. France and Britain will both surely prosper as a result of this historic treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COBDENCHEVALIERPROPOSAL;\n\nGreat Britain has proposed a free trade agreement that would significantly reduce our tariff barriers and substantially increase our mutual trade. British MP George Cobden and French statesman Michel Chevalier have arranged an audience with the monarch of France to convince him of the great benefits of the treaty: France could more easily export its wines, brandies, silk goods and more to Britain, whilst sought-after industrial goods would cross the Channel in the opposite direction, all available to consumers at significantly cheaper prices due to the removal of tariff barriers. Is this not in the interest of both France and Britain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cobden_chevalier_modifier_desc;The Cobden-Chevalier Treaty is an Anglo-French free trade agreement that has ended tariffs on the main items of trade, including wine, brandy and silk goods from France, and coal, iron and industrial goods from Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
