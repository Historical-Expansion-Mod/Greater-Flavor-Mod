rail_consolidation;Rail Consolidation;;
rail_consolidation_desc;Rail development was originally often local, resulting over time in ownership distributed over a myriad companies of various sizes, all operating to maximize their own profits without regard for the rest of the network, many having been rendered barely viable due to economic developments since their original construction. By governmental consolidation of rail lines, either through promotion of mergers or outright nationalization, viability was improved as development could be done with regard to the whole, rather than the narrow interests of owners of small parts of it.;;

structure_of_the_atom;Structure of the Atom;;
structure_of_the_atom_desc;The idea that matter consists of indivisible elementary particles called atoms has existed since antiquity. In the 19th century, chemists had largely concluded that to be the case, as that postulate explained the mass ratios of reagents and products of chemical reactions. However, experiments carried out at the beginning of the 20th century showed that the atom might not be elementary after all, but actually consist of electrically charged constituent parts. The first model was the plum pudding model, depicting the atom as a continuous positively charged medium with smaller negatively charged electrons as discrete particles embedded in it. Other experiments suggested the concentration of positive charge to a nucleus. A development of that idea was the planetary model of the atom, wherein negative electrons orbited the nucleus like planets around the Sun. While this latter model enjoyed more empirical support, it raised the question of why the electrons do not lose energy by emitting radiation, as charged particles were known to do when being accelerated. It was the first indication that the microscopic world of elementary particles worked according to entirely different laws than the macroscopic, paving the way for the development of quantum mechanics.;;

;;;Erster Mähdrescher in $PROVINCENAME$
;;;'Mutter, warum haben wir noch keinen McCormick-Mähdrescher? Jeder andere hat schon einen!'\n\nIm frühen 19. Jahrhundert wurden diverse mechanische Werkzeuge für die Landwirtschaft entwickelt: zum säen, ernten, dreschen oder die Forstwirtschaft.
;;;Wir ernten, was wir säten
;;;
;;;Dampfmaschinen in $PROVINCENAME$
;;;'Mutter, hörst du das? Da ist ein neues Ding in der Mine, welches die Steine von ganz alleine bewegt.'\n\nEine der ersten Einsätze für Dampfmaschinen war der Transport des Erzes aus den Minen. Diese frühe Entwicklung der Industriellen Revolution hat nun Einzug gehalten in die Minen von $PROVINCENAME$.

;;;Lancashire Webstuhl
;;;This was the first semi-automatic loom. With a single operator action, it kept weaving until the shuttle ran out of thread. Consequently, a single worker could operate several looms simultaneously, increasing productivity.
;;;Einfachnaht-Nähmaschine
;;;A lockstitch seam is one consisting of two threads on opposite sides of the cloth, held in place by being entwined at each hole made by the needle. It is a simple but very neat and durable seam, and a machine capable of quickly producing one will improve the efficiency of clothing production.
;;;Einspannvorrichtungen
;;;Die Einführung von Einspannvorrichtungen steigerte die Effizienz aller Maschinen enorm, was wiederum die Produktion der meisten Industriegüter steigerte.
;;;Mechanische Bandsäge
;;;Band saws offer an advantage over circular saws both in being able to make curved cuts and in having a smaller cut width, wasting less wood as sawdust.
;;;Northrops Mechanischer Webstuhl
;;;This was the first fully automatic loom, improving on earlier semi-automatic looms by adding an automatic loading mechanism to replace empty shuttles without any operator action. It allowed a single worker to operate up to 16 looms at once.
;;;Doppelnaht
;;;The overlock pattern consists of two parallel seams connected by a crisscrossing third seam. It is a very durable pattern. Machines capable of producing such a pattern will efficiently produce clothing of high quality.
;;;Packautomaten
;;;The assembly line enhances many manufacturing processes, but particularly ones that consist of a sequence of mechanically simple actions, such as packaging.
;;;Colburn Glaswalze
;;;This was a machine that mechanically rolled molten glass into flat panes, allowing for efficient mass production of windows.
;;;Owens Glasblasautomat
;;;Mechanization of the act of glassblowing itself increased the output of the glassware industry tremendously.
;;;Drehrohröfen
;;;The rotary kiln allowed for cement to be heated with higher thermal efficiency than before, while simultaneously being mixed, with continuous feeding of raw material and removal of final cement. Its introduction increased both the quality and quantity of cement produced.
;;;Portland Zement
;;;By using calcium sulphate as the reactive ingredient, Portland cement yielded concrete that was both stronger and faster to settle than earlier formulas.
;;;Rauchfreier Sprengstoff
;;;Smokeless powder is gunpowder that combusts almost completely, leaving neither ash to foul the barrel nor smoke to impair vision on the battlefield. Not having to clean the barrel between shots greatly increases potential rates of fire.
;;;Kraft-Prozess
;;;The Kraft process is a chemical process using sodium hydroxide and sulfide to break down wood into pulp. Contrary to earlier processes, it allows for most of the pulping chemicals to be recovered afterwards. Simply put, our paper industry has developed a way to have its cake and eat it too!
;;;Aspirin
;;;Relatively cheap and easy to produce industrially, aspirin was one of the first mass-produced pharmaceutical products.
;;;Geräuscharme Signalübertragung
;;;Electromagnetic shielding, twisted pairs, differential transmission, and other methods of noise reduction can be used to allow for signal transmission over longer distances, and for more precise functionality in electric systems.
;;;Katalytisches Cracken
;;;Cracking is the breaking of large hydrocarbons into smaller parts. It allows for heavy, thick, ungainly oils to be turned into more fluid ones, improving the quality of refined fuel.
;;;Vakuumröhren
;;;A vacuum tube is a device where thermal emission is used to cause a controllable current. Different kinds of vacuum tubes can, in a fairly rudimentary way, fulfil the function of a diode or a transistor, allowing for actual electronics for the first time.
