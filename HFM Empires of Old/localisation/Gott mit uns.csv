EVTNAME200001;Der Dom zu Köln;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC200001;Romantic sentiment and evolving nationalistic spirit of our people have evoked a high interest in the medieval age, which is seen as the root of the german culture. A symbol of these far away and backward times are the cathedrals of gothic architectural style. Cologne, once the biggest german city, and one of the finest places in the times of the Holy Roman Empire, has one of the greatest cathredrals in human history - which is a large, abandoned construction area. Founded in the 13th century, the building work was suspended in the 1530s. Even the old construction crane is there above! Since 1814, when the construction plans were found again by Georg Moller in Darmstadt, there were several voices to revive the work of our ancestors - and new founded societies have argued, that this project should not be only a private intention. Maybe we should give state support, and finish this great gothic masterpiece, in the name of the german nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cologne_cathedral_title;The Cathedral of Cologne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cologne_cathedral_desc;With the 19th century romantic enthusiasm for the Middle Ages, and spurred on by the lucky discovery of the original plan for the façade, it was decided, with the commitment of the Court, to complete the cathedral. It was achieved by civic effort. In 1840, the burghers of Cologne petitioned the king for the foundation of a association regarding the buidling of the Cologne cathedral. After the permission and promised financial help, the Central-Dombauverein was founded in 1842. The association raised two-thirds of the enormous costs (over 1 billion US-Dollar in today's money), while the state supplied the remaining third.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME200005;The German anthem;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200005;A debate is held in the parliament of our newborn nation. Nationalists, liberals, monarchists and conservatives argued in an open tumoil regarding the new anthem of Germany. Several songs were nominated, but each has a different meaning for different political groups. Intellectuals are convinced, that the new anthem will have a heavy influence on our people, and will be a symbol of Germany in the world. The struggle between monarchists and liberals was settled by some moderate conservatives, who proposed other suggestions for the anthem. In the end, we have now four nominations, the first proposed by the monarchists, the second by the liberals, and the other two as a way to strike a balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME200006;The first 'Beethovenfest';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200006;In 1845, the greatest living musicians of Germany fullfilled their project to erect a monument in memory of Ludwig van Beethoven, born in the city of Bonn in 1770. Beethoven is viewed by many as the most influential compositor of the 19th century. The inauguration of the monument was celebrated with a great music feast, in which Franz Liszt took part. High ranking monarchs of the german states and whole europe joint the festivity, which was marked by unbelieveable musical mastership, scandals and diplomatic issues between the great powers. Anyway, Beethoven was a symbol of the unresting german nation spirit, and the values of liberty and democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME200007;The Constitution of Hanover;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200007;When King William died, Princess Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. Ernest Augustus became the King of Hanover. Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective, and would have preferred the popular viceroy, the Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but both of Ernest's younger brothers refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. Hanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in 1819. This did little more than denote Hanover's change from an electorate to a kingdom, granted by the Congress of Vienna. The Duke of Cambridge, as King William's viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganisation of the Hanoverian government. William IV had given his consent to a new constitution in 1833. The Duke of Cumberland's consent was neither asked nor received, and he had formally protested against the constitution's adoption without his consent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200008;The Göttinger Seven Protest;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200008;About one month after he succeeded to the throne, King Ernest addressed the matter of the Constitution. He stated that he was not bound by it, as his consent had not been asked to it. He also indicated that it would have been different, or perhaps even non-existent, had he been in power at the time of its composition. He declared that it was his aim and ambition to make the necessary changes to the constitution and rewrite it to reflect his values. Hearing this, Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann - a famous german historian -, made an attempt to persuade his colleagues at the University of Göttingen senate to disapprove of the king's intent to change the constitution, and take some form of action. At first, none of his colleagues were willing to support him. But when King Ernest annulled the constitution, Dahlmann again appealed to the university, and composed a protestation in regards to opposing Augustus' decision. This time, he received a better response, six other professors were now willing to sign as opposers. These six, plus Dahlmann, would become known as the Göttingen Seven.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200009;The Göttinger Seven;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200009;Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the new King Ernest August dissolved the parliament which had been convened under the disputed constitution. He proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the ground that his consent had not been asked, and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs. The King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored. In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at Göttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths, and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions, and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover. However, he was widely criticised in other parts of Germany and Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths, and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree. In the House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British King, the Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British Throne by his actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200011;The Famous Göttinger Seven;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200011;Remember our heroes! Remember the Göttinger Seven! Praise their virtues!' When Professor Dahlmann published his documents against the King of Hanover, it received popular support by german students and liberals. It had an explosive influence in the german states of the German Confederation. The students at the university of Göttingen produced many hundreds, or even thousands, of copies and disseminated them across Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200012;The Göttinger Seven Seek Refuge;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200012;History shows us noble and free men, who dared to say the full truth in the face of the King. The permission has one, who has courage.' After their struggle in Hanover, some of the Göttinger Seven searched a new university where they could continue their work, namely Dahlmann, Gervinus and Jacob Grimm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200013;Aftermath of the Göttinger Seven;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200013;Now, that Germany is united and liberal thoughts are not more seen as a thread, but a basis of our values, the Göttinger Seven are viewed as national heroes. They are remembered by the politicans as spearheads of our liberal constitution and the people see them as upright Germans, who fought for their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200014;Vormärz;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200014;In 1836, the states of the German Confederation were in the middle of the so-called 'Vormärz' (pre-March). The name derived from the later (failed) revolution in the march of 1848, and was a period which was shaped by the Austrian and Prussian police states, the censorship of the press and restricted freedoms. But it was also the time of german romanticism, evolving nationalism and great personalities, which made germany to the land of poets and thinkers. German culture blossomed, intellectuals stood up against reactionary governments, and such ideas as national unity and wider suffrage became topics of a new liberal and democratic movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200015;The kneeling controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200015;Traditionally, Bavaria was a catholic state. But with the foundation of the kingdom and the annexations of surrounding lands in the Napoleonic age, Bavaria gained large territories which were protestant. In this time, the king promoted a more tolerant politic toward his subjects. An example was the edict, that protestant soldiers had not to knee in front of a catholic mass or procession. However, Minister Karl von Abel has proposed to change this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200016;The Blittersdorf Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200016;Baden was one of the most liberal states in the German Confederation. However, in the late 1830s and beginning 1840s, minister Friedrich von Blittersdorf went against the liberal and democratic traditions of Baden. He promoted monarchic traditions, which lead to much discontent among the liberal society of this south german country. Especially the bureaucrats and officials were upset by his reactionary politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200017;Baden Ends Government Censorship;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200017;It seems that the government in Baden has decided to reestablish free press rights. That is against the Carlsbad Decrees, which were enforced by us and should save the monarchical order in this region. Maybe we should protest against this step.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200018;Austrian and Prussian Protests!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200018;Austria and Prussia have protested against our reestablished press rights. We can still go on, but it will ruin our relationship with these great powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200019;Deutsches Wörterbuch;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200019;Das Deutsche Wörterbuch (The German Dictionary) is one of the most important dictionaries of the German language. It is for German what the Oxford English Dictionary is for English, containing detailed historical information about the origin and use over time of German words, with examples taken from actual documents. In German the dictionary is also known as 'Der Grimm'. It was started by the Grimm brothers (known also for Grimms' Fairy Tales) in 1838.  Initially the Grimm brothers expected the project to take ten years and produce 6–7 volumes. In fact, the first volume was not published until 1854. Wilhelm Grimm died in 1859, and Jacob in 1863, while working on the entry for 'Frucht' (fruit). After their deaths multiple institutions were involved in the work, including the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Berlin Academy, with a center in Goettingen also involved. Finally completed in 1961, the dictionary will contain 32 volumes and include about 350,000 main entries. The 'Grimm' was not only a scientific, but also national work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200021;Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200021;In 1843, the german poet Heinrich Heine, who left Germany 1831 for France, went back for a few weeks, visiting his mother and publisher Julius Campe in Hamburg. Heine was not a typical romantic author, but more a satirical one who criticized the reactionary policy and censorship of the authoritarian german states, but also his nationalistic and chauvinistic compatriots. On the return journey to Paris, the first draft of 'Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen' (Germany: A Winter's Tale) took shape. The verse epic appeared in 1844 published by Hoffmann and Campe, Hamburg. According to the censorship regulations of the Carlsbad Conference of 1819, manuscripts of more than twenty folios did not fall under the scrutiny of the censor. Therefore it was published together with other poems in a volume called ‘New Poems’. The work showed Heine’s world of images and his folk-song-like poetic diction in a compact gathering, with cutting, ironic criticisms of the circumstances in his homeland. Heine’s verse-epic was much debated in Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200023;Heine and Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200023;Still always that wooden pedantic race/ Still always a right angle/ In every movement and every face/ The frozen conceit.' Heine, a former Prussian citizen (he was born in Düsseldorf), was against the militarism in his own country. In his verse-epic he critized the 'Prussian behaviour', but went also against the transfiguring german romanticism. In fact, he made fun of the anachronistic Germans, who prefered to finish a medieval cathedral, instead of looking forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200025;Scandals at the Beethoven Festival;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200025;The ceremony was not without its awkward moments. Beethoven monument turned its back on the most important guests, King Frederick William IV of Prussia and the British Queen Victoria, who had taken their places on the balcony of the Fürstenberg Palace. Alexander von Humboldt saved the day by remarking that Beethoven had always been a rude fellow. Even more embarrassed was the fact that, during the toasts at the festival banquet in the 'Goldene Stern', Liszt snubbed the French contingent led by Berlioz and nearly caused a riot. Also, the Spanish dancer, Lola Montez, the famous mistress of the popular tragic-romantic King Ludwig I of Bavaria, made a scandalous guest appearance by dancing wildly on the tables. The king was later forced to end his affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200029;Germanistentag 1846;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200029;In 1846, a conference of german historians, philologists and lawyers was held in Frankfurt. German history, law and language were debated topics, but also political issues like the question regarding a national state. Prominent personalities of this remarkable meeting of german thinkers were Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, Georg Waitz and Johann Gustav Droysen. Venue was the old townhall of Frankfurt, the 'Römer'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200031;Germanistentag 1847;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200031;In 1847, a conference of german historians, philologists and lawyers was held in Frankfurt. 170 academics under the leadership of Jacob Grimm debated on history, law and language, but also political issues. The conference was described as an 'intellectual assembly of the German people'. On the last day, when a banquet was held in the old townshall of Lubeck, Heinrich Carl Jaup demanded a general citizenship as a first step towards a unified nation state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200033;Goethe Monument;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200033;The citizens of Frankfurt have edified a monument to honour Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, perhaps the most important german-speaking author and a symbol of german culture in general. This event is regarded as a national sensation among liberals and patriots.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200034;The Constitutional Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200034;Like Baden, Hesse-Kassel had a rather liberal constitution. But after the liberal revolution, Elector Friedrich Wilhelm assigned a reactionary government and conducted an unpopular policy against the traditional liberties. The most radical step were his decrees, which were against the constitution. A conflict between the elector and the parliament evolved, ending in the suspension of the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
free_press_in_baden_title;Abolish Censorship of the Press!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
free_press_in_baden_desc;As one of the pioneers of liberalism and constitutionalism, until 1832 Baden had been one of the few states with the freedom of the press. However, under immense pressure of the reactionary governments in the German Confederation - namely Prussia and Austria - we were forced to abolish this fundamental right. We can try to reintroduce free press rights, but we will face the wrath of these two great powers once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME200035;Humboldt's Kosmos;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200035;Kosmos (usually referred to in English as 'Cosmos') was an influential treatise on science and nature written by the German scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. Kosmos began as a lecture series delivered by Humboldt at the University of Berlin, and was published in five volumes between 1845 and 1862 (the fifth was posthumous and incomplete). Widely read by academics and laymen alike, it applied the ancient Greek view of the orderliness of the cosmos (the universe) to the Earth, suggesting that universal laws applied as well to the apparent chaos of the terrestrial world. Controversially for the time, Humboldt in Kosmos spoke of the spirituality of the natural world only in general terms, avoiding the notion of a creator.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200036;Robert Schumann;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200036;Robert Schumann is regarded as one of the most representative composers of the Romantic era. In 1850, he suceeded Ferdinand Hiller as musical director and moved to Düsseldorf. Although criticized regarding his poor conductor skills and scoffed because of his 'creative decay', Schumann composed his last symphony, the 'Rhenish'. He used Beethoven's and Mendelssohn's symphonies as a model, but was also inspired by his impressions of the Rhineland. Schumann himself stated, that his journey to Cologne and the sight of the cathedral were his main inspiration for this composition, which became one of his most famous works.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200037;Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200037;Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy was a German composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early Romantic period. Early success in Germany, where he also revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, was followed by travel throughout Europe. His essentially conservative musical tastes, however, set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook. His Violin Concerto was his last large orchestral work and is one of the most popular and most frequently performed violin concertos of all time. The concerto was first performed in Leipzig on 13 March 1845 with Ferdinand David as soloist. Mendelssohn was unable to conduct due to illness and the premiere was conducted by the Danish composer Niels Gade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200038;Franz Liszt;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200038;Franz Liszt became renowned in Europe during the nineteenth century for his virtuosic skill as a pianist. He was said by his contemporaries to have been the most technically advanced pianist of his age. In the 1840s he was considered by some to be perhaps the greatest pianist of all time. He was also a well-known composer, piano teacher, and conductor. He was a benefactor to other composers, including Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg and Alexander Borodin. He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work in which he influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated some 20th-century ideas and trends. When Liszt took up a long-standing invitation of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia to settle at Weimar, the most important period of his creative work began. Liszt had ample time to compose and during the next 12 years revised or produced those orchestral and choral pieces upon which his reputation as a composer mainly rested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200039;Johannes Brahms;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200039;Johannes Brahms was a German composer and pianist, and one of the leading musicians of the Romantic period. Born in Hamburg, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna, Austria, where he was a leader of the musical scene. In his lifetime, Brahms's popularity and influence were considerable. Following a comment by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow, he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the Three Bs. Brahms composed for piano, chamber ensembles, symphony orchestra, and for voice and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works and worked with some of the leading performers of his time. It was the premiere of A German Requiem, his largest choral work, in Bremen, in 1868, that confirmed Brahms's European reputation and led many to accept that he had conquered Beethoven and the symphony. This gave him the confidence finally to complete a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200040;Schubert's 'Unfinished';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200040;Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B minor, commonly known as the 'Unfinished Symphony' (German: Unvollendete), was started in 1822 but left with only two movements known to be complete, even though Schubert would live for another six years. After his death, the work fell into oblivion, until Johann von Herbeck found it in the possession of Schubert's friend Anselm Hüttenbrenner in 1865. Herbeck conducted the symphony in the same year, and the performance was met with great enthusiams by the audience. The work is often referred to as Schubert’s first romantic symphony owing to its emphasis on expressive melody, vivid harmony, and creative combinations of orchestral tone color. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200041;Johann Strauss;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200041;Johann Strauss (son) was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as 'The Waltz King', and was largely then responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include The Blue Danube, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known. The operetta 'Die Fledermaus' premièred on 5 April 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, and has been part of the regular operetta repertoire ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200042;Gustav Mahler;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200042;Gustav Mahler was a late-Romantic Austrian composer and one of the leading conductors of his generation. As a composer, he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). His innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner and Mozart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200043;Richard Strauss;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200043;Richard Georg Strauss was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include Der Rosenkavalier and Salome, his Lieder - especially his Four Last Songs - and his tone poems and other orchestral works, such as Death and Transfiguration, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, Also sprach Zarathustra, An Alpine Symphony, and Metamorphosen. Strauss was also a prominent conductor throughout Germany and Austria. Strauss, along with Gustav Mahler, represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Richard Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. In 1905, Strauss produced Salome, a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the play by Oscar Wilde, in 1909 followd Elektra. Both were performed in Dresden for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200044;Anton Bruckner;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200044;Anton Bruckner was an Austrian composer known for his symphonies, masses, and motets. The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies. Unlike other musical radicals, such as Richard Wagner or Hugo Wolf who fit the enfant terrible mould, Bruckner showed extreme humility before other musicians, Wagner in particular. The apparent dichotomy between Bruckner the man and Bruckner the composer hampers efforts to describe his life in a way that gives a straightforward context for his music. His works, the symphonies in particular, had detractors, most notably the influential Austrian critic Eduard Hanslick, and other supporters of Johannes Brahms. He died in 1896.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200045;Arnold Schönberg;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200045;Arnold Schönberg was an Austrian composer and painter, associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. In the 1920s, Schönberg developed the twelve-tone technique, a widely influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation, and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea. Schönberg was also a painter, an important music theorist, and an influential teacher of compo...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200046;Mondnacht;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200046;Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff was a German poet and novelist of the later German romantic school. Eichendorff's guiding poetic theme was that Man should find happiness in full absorption of the beauties and changing moods of Nature. The lyricism of Eichendorff's poetry is much praised, and his poems have been set by many composers, including Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hans Pfitzner, and Alexander Zemlinsky. In 1837, his poem 'Mondnacht' (Night of the Moon) was published, which is often seen as the 'pearl of pearls' of german romantic lyricism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200047;Carl Spitzweg;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200047;Carl Spitzweg was a German romanticist painter and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era. His father, a wealthy merchant, had Carl trained as a pharmacist. He attained his qualification from the University of Munich, but while recovering from an illness he also took up painting. Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, and began by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed his first work to satiric magazines. Upon receiving an inheritance in 1833, he was able to dedicate himself to painting. His later paintings and drawings were often humorous genre works. In 1839, his first painting 'The Poor Poet' was published. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200048;Clemens Brentano;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200048;Clemens Brentano was a German poet and novelist, born in Ehrenbreitstein, near Koblenz. Brentano, whose early writings were published under the pseudonym Maria, belonged to the Heidelberg group of German romantic writers, and his works are marked by excess of fantastic imagery and by abrupt, bizarre modes of expression. On the whole his finest work is the collection of Romanzen vom Rosenkranz (published posthumously in 1852). His short stories were very popular. The latter part of his life he spent in Regensburg, Frankfurt and Munich, actively engaged in promoting the Catholic faith. Against his will, his works were often seen as devotional literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME200049;The Weavers of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200049;In $PROVINCENAME$, social, economical and political problems are evident.

EVTDESC200050;In $YEAR$, an uprising of weavers took place in $COUNTRY$.

EVTNAME200052;The Weavers;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC200052;In $YEAR$, Gerhart Hauptmann's play The Weavers was first performed. Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period, as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions, the play has no true central character, providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting. Instead of a hero, Hauptmann created a mob. This mob is therefore the protagonist - or chief character - and if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long.

the_grunderzeit2_desc;The 'Gründerzeit', 'The Founding Era', refers to a period, stretching roughly from 1840 to the mid 1870s, of rapid economic modernization and industrialization of Germany and eastern Europe in general, and Vienna in particular. The era became know among other things for a its particular style of architecture, inspired by neo-gothic themes and imagery and the new building styles that industrialization had made possible, as well as for the rising tide of political liberalism that came with it. Support these new trends, and watch our capital blossom.;"Le ""Gründerzeit"" (époque des fondateurs) désigne une période comprise entre 1840 et le milieu des années 1870 qui se caractérise par la modernisation économique et l'industrialisation rapides de l'Allemagne et l'Europe de l'est en général, et de Vienne en particulier. Cette période est notamment connue pour son style architectural (inspiré par les thèmes et l'imagerie néogothiques ainsi que par les nouveaux styles de bâtiments que l'industrialisation avait rendu possibles) et pour la vague montante de libéralisme politique qui l'accompagna. Soutenez ces nouvelles tendances et assistez à la floraison de Vienne.";Der Ausdruck 'Gründerzeit' bezieht sich auf eine Periode, die sich grob von 1840 bis Mitte der 1870er Jahre erstreckte. In dieser Phase war Deutschland und Osteuropa, besonders Wien, Schauplatz rascher wirtschaftlicher Modernisierung und Industrialisierung. Die Ära wurde unter anderem für ihren besonderen architektonischen Stil berühmt, der von neugotischen Themen und von der Industrialisierung ermöglichten Baustilen sowie dem damit einhergehenden Aufstieg des politischen Liberalismus inspiriert wurde. Dies war besonders in Wien der Fall. Wenn wir diese neuen Trends unterstützen, wird Wien aufblühen.;;La 'Gründerzeit' o 'era de los fundadores' hace referencia a un período que va más o menos de la década de 1840 a mediados de la década de 1870 que se caracterizó por una rápida modernización económica de Alemania y Europa Oriental en general, especialmente de Viena. Esta era fue conocida entre otras cosas por su particular estilo de arquitectura inspirado por temas e imaginería neogótica y por los nuevos estilos de construcción que la industrialización había hecho posible. También fue conocida por la oleada de liberalismo político que al acompañó. Viena, en esta era, apoyaría esas nuevas tendencias y experimentaría un gran florecimiento.;;;;;;;;x;

build_schiller_denkmal_desc;Friedrich Schiller was the greatest son of Württemberg. He was a poet, philosopher, historian, and playwright. Schiller stands in one row with Goethe, and both were the leaders of the period which is known as Weimar Classicism. It is time to build a monument for him. This will reassure a little bit the liberal elite in the short term, but may have influence on the national movement in the long term.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

build_neuschwanstein_desc;Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century Romanesque Revival palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, Germany. The palace was commissioned by Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and as a homage to Richard Wagner. The palace was intended as a personal refuge for the reclusive king, but it was opened to the paying public immediately after his death in 1886. Later, Neuschwanstein became a global of the era of the era of Romanticism. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

build_maximilianstrasse_desc;The neo-Renaissance Maximilianstraße in Munich is one of the city's four royal avenues. It starts at Max-Joseph-Platz, where the Residenz and the National Theatre are situated, and runs from west to east. Principal was king Maximilian II of Bavaria, who started the project in 1850, the avenue is named for his honour. Leading architect was Friedrich Bürklein. With this project, the king also aimed to 'invent' a new architectural style which would combine the best features of historical models combined with then modern building technology. The avenue is framed by mostly neo-Gothic buildings influenced by the English Perpendicular style. With its palaces, monuments and hotels, the Maximilianstraße became one of the most attractive streets in Germany and Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

early_archaeology_desc;Archaeology is the study of human activity, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which includes artifacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record). Study of human antiquity date back in the days of the Renaissance, but in the 19th century, Archaeology evolved to a real science. Archaeologists began to investigate various areas around the world, with the study of ancient Aegean civilization being stimulated by the excavations of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy, and of Arthur Evans at Crete, whilst John Lloyd Stephens was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of Maya civilization throughout Central America. However, the methodologies employed by these archaeologists were highly flawed by the standards of the 20th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
modern_archaeology;Modern Archaeology;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
modern_archaeology_desc;Further advancements in archaeological field methodology arose in the late 19th century. One of the pioneering figures in this was Augustus Pitt Rivers, who meticulously excavated on Cranborne Chase in southern England, emphasising that it was not only items of beauty or value that should be recorded but mundane items as well. He therefore helped to differentiate archaeology from antiquarianism. Flinders Petrie introduced systematic methodology in archaeology and preservation of artifacts. Archaeologists - once nothing more than tomb raiders - became reputable scientists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC201005;Unfortunately, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to give us access to the jungle of Yucatan. That was an official statement of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Minister of foreign affairs. Nevertheless, there may be still a chance to get a permission. Our diplomats were able to talk with some deputies, who would talk with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ head of state. But without bribing and a share of our research findings, it will be impossible to convince him. And if we succeed, we will be viewed as dishonest in the archaeological and international scene.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

A high regarded exhibition is held this week, to celebrate our newly made researchs in Africa, Asia and Southern America.  In fact, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologists are highly regarded in the world. Precious artefacts, amazing sarcophagues and ancient steles or sculptures are exposed by them on this occasion. People of our nation, neighbours, and even other great powers are guests.

EVTNAME201015;$COUNTRY$, a backward country?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201015;The last archaeological exhibition was not without it side effects. We were mocked as 'backward scientists'. Without excavations and expeditions, our prestige has suffered in the international scene. To make things worse: we lack even the basics of archaeological science. If we want to catch up, we must better our methods and educate a new generation of scientists. But without practice, we won't get further. As we can't get access to the exotic places of this world, a commission has proposed to gain experience in a local excavation. If we have an organized and professional troop of archaeologists, we may have more chances in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201017;Local excavation;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201017;It seems, that after years of practising and studying, our scientists have found an interesting place, which was mostly neglected in the past.

It seems, that we have started our own archaeological project.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC201018;Modern science is on the rise. $COUNTRY$, a high regarded nation of historians, philologues and archaeologists, is well-known for its researches.

EVTNAME201021;An old stele;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201021;Deep in the jungle, our archaeologists have found an old stele of the classical period. This artefact is not only a wonderful piece of art, but will give us new insight in the ancient world of the Mayas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201022;Mysterious Maya Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201022;Haze lays above the forests and hills of Yucatan. The mist clears up, as our expedition keeps going through the wild and awkward jungle. Jaguars and other ferocious beasts are living in this unspoiled nature. Savages has hunted a group of our team and injured many. They were doomed. Others were infected by Malaria, victims of the feared and bloodthirsty Mosquitos. Only a little grouplet of three persons has survived the exertions. The leader, a man with three-day stubble and a bull-whip in his hand, gives a sign to rest for a while. Steles and rocks with engravings. The whole territory is marked by them. The archaeologist's eyes flit over stairs, destroyed and mossy. The ancient ruin of a Maya pyramid. He pricks up his ears, as one of the heavers raises his hand and shouts: 'Hombre, I think I found the entrance!';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201023;Our expedition has found an ancient Maya Pyramid in the middle of the jungle of Yucatan. And even more, our chief-archaeologist, René Emile Belloq, was able to get a holy idol, which was coincidentally in the hand of a fedora-wearing american archaeologist. Unfortunately, this poor man was slained by savages of the local Hovito tribe, as Belloq affirms. Now, this wonderful idol will be our new tourist attraction in the Mesoamerican section of the Louvre!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201025;Expedition members eaten by Dinosaurs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201025;The members of our last expedition in the unexplored jungles of Yucatan have returned without success. The survivors, emaciated, pale and littered with scars, have lost even their equipment and are happy that they were able to return. But the director of the Archaeological Museum rose his eyebrows, when they were forced to tell, what happened to the other team members, the heavers and the equipment. The leading archaeologists shouted like a maniac, made wild gesticulations and told, that they were lost in a hidden valley, in the middle of the jungle, unknown to anyone. In this valley, prehistoric animals like dinosaurs and other extinct creatures lived and attacked the expedition. He continued his fantastic story, becoming even more exaggerated, and was finally brought in a sanatory. We don't know what happened, but this man has clearly lost his mind. Now we must start from the scratch. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201026;El Mirador discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201026;Ruins in the jungle as far as the eye can reach. These remains are old - very old, as our archaeologists affirm. This huge city is one of the biggest places ever found in Yucatan, and it dates back to pre-classical times. El Mirador, one of the oldest and greatest settlements of the Mayan culture, was rediscovered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201027;A Mayan Riddle;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201027;Footsteps resound in the hall. Light is rare, only a torch illuminates engraved walls. Silence. You go farther, through a corridor. Observing the plates on the ground, the roots of enormous trees, which break through the collapsed ceiling. An amazing place. You take a breath. A breath of history, which floatens this atmosphere. Then, after minutes of walking through mossy corridors, you find a monumental gate, decorated with faces and hieroglyphs. A short view in your book later, you are able to read what the Mayas wrote centuries ago on this wall. It's a riddle: 'The farmer needs it/ the capitalist loves it/ and builds even factories/ but you hate it./ If you stockpile the/ most useless good in/ the world you will/ uncover the truth.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201028;The Idol;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201028;You fetch your bag with fertilizer. (Every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist has his bag with fertilizer with him, as everyone knows, because of the famous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fertilizer Decree, which enforces every archaeologist to take a bag of fertilizer with him, because nobody in the world wants to buy it and $COUNTRY$ searches ways to get rid of it.) In front of you stands an altar. Gold sparkles in the glimming light. An Mayan idol. A sceptical look to it. A look to the bag. You weigh the bag in your hand, estimating the weight of the idol. Fertilizer runs out of the bag. It is now lightier. You are waiting for the moment, staring at the idol, the bag with fertilizer in the left hand, your right hand on the head of the artefact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201029;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201029;You are able to replace the idol. The bag of fertilizer lays on the altar. You look in the face of the strange idol, enjoying the beauty of Mayan art. Savouring this moment, only for a little while. Noises. Brutal, loud noises interrupt the scene. You look upward. Something has changed. The muffled noise becomes louder. Something is rolling. Something big. Very big. A gigantic stoneball!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201030;You escape through the corridors, the idol in your right hand, but the trap is triggered. A gigantic stoneball is rolling right behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201031;An evil Frenchman;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201031;With a last jump you are able to reach the exit of the pyramid, landing in the grass of the jungle - and cornered by mesoamerican Indios. A voice with a soft french accent sounds in the near. A man in white clothes looks at you, amused by your escape. 'It is nice to meet you. But I think, this artefact should be in better hands than yours.' You are forced to surrender, as the heavers were killed by the tribe. 'Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do' is your only response. Your are able to flee - but without the idol.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201032;Leaving the Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201032;On your way out of the pyramid, you clatch at a root in the ceiling. The idol in the left, the root in the right, the stoneball rolls under your shoes, through the corridor, and crushs in the jungle. You slump down, following the devastation. As you reach the exit, you see smashed bodies of Indios, scattered spears and weapons. It seems, that someone prepared an ambush, which was dissolved by the huge ball. Not sure, what happened here, but now, that the expedition was a full success, it is time to return to $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201033;An archive of cuneiform tablets;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201033;Clay tablets were used as writing medium in the ancient middle east. Imprinted cuneiform characters can give us a whole new viewing of the old times of Babylonia. Satisfyingly, our archaeologists have found a whole archive of old tablets on their last expedition. They believe, that this archive was part of a large palace of an unknown ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201034;Sumerian palace found;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201034;Today is an exceptional day for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology. After months of researchs and excavations, our team has found an old palace, dating back to sumerian times. Our archaeologists estimate, that this structures are over 5000 years old!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201035;Mesopotamian expedition failed;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201035;The archaeological team in Mesopotamia is in a bad crisis. It seems, that the place of research was miscalculated by the chief-archaeologists. In fact, they have searched for month at the false place, finding nothing and remaining only with dirt in their hands. That is a heavy setback for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201036;The Tower of Babel;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201036;Scientific research and aerial photos leave no doubt: Babylon, once a myth and known in the west only as a decadent city mentioned in the bible, is now a well known place of modern archaeology. The Hanging Gardens of Semiramis and a large palace were found and carefully examined. Archivs full of clay tablets were translated. But the most prestigious trove was the discovery by an $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist, who confirmed that even the legendary Tower of Babel is not a fable, but has historical roots. A large building was found, believed as the example for the story in the bible. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

inca_excavations_interrupted_desc;The communication between our expedition in Peru and our archaeological society is interupted. Until the war goes on, our enemies will try to disturb every information exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201040;Preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201040;The Andes are rough and dangerous. Our archaeologists should be well equipped before we send them in the mountains. A list of goods was made, which the expedition demands. We should prepare 1 airplane, 1 off-road vehicle, 2 units of canned food and 3 barrels of fuel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201041;The expedition begins;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201041;The Peruvian sun scorches our skin. We have left Cusco one week ago, entering the endless lands of mountains. The majesty of the Andes is overwhelming, and the ravines deep like the gorges of hell. Henry, my fellow student from twenty years ago, has joined this journey to undiscovered lands. His nose and eyes are deepened in a book. 'So, this was the way they took?', he asks en passant. 'No wonder they got lost.' My only response is a nod. Henry is an experienced archaeologist, a high regarded personality. Unlike me, he was able to climb the career ladder. They say, that he would be able to find Alexander's tomb in a second, only wandering in it's near - when others dug for centuries, only excavating some old chicken bones. 'The aeroplane is ready', I mention, wiping the sweat from my eyebrows. It's the moment, when Henry puts his book away. 'Aeroplane?', sounds his voice sceptically, 'I don't like them. You know, I get sick in these darn machines. What about the car the government offered us?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201042;An old bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201042;I follow Henry's advice. I'm the official leader of this expedition, but I know Henry's aversion against these new technologies. When we began with our studies at the university, our professors put us for days in dirty holes, only equipped with a rusty shovel and outdated instruments. Now, everything has changed. The methods, the equipment. Even a car. 'That's a fine kind of travelling', Henry says, leaning in the cushioned seat beside me, viewing the panorama. Maybe I must correct myself - some technologies seem to please even Henry. But than, we are forced to make a stop. A river cuts the hills in front of us, and only an old bridge connects both sides. It is obvious that we can't go on the other side with our vehicle. The bridge seems in a bad condition, only made of ragged ropes. I look in Henry's direction. 'And now? What shall we do?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201043;Crossing the bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201043;"The ropes make noises, as we have decided to left the car behind and cross the bridge. We have shouldered our equipment. We make one step after another, looking only forward. The noises become louder. 'Maybe that was not the the best idea', I suggest. Henry doesn't give an answer. His hands are trembling. His hands staring to the ropes. 'The ropes! The ropes are ripping - go back, before the whole bridge collapses!"" But his warnings are to late. It seems, that we have overloaded the old bridge, tearing the ropes in pieces. Yelling and cryings later, clutching the salvaging ropes with both hands, we dangle above the abyss, seeing our equipment falling in the depth of Andean valleys. We are save, hanging at the clip, but lost our equipment. An idea comes to our mind: this bridge was an Incan trap. And without our provisions we are forced to give up.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201044;Lost in the mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201044;Taking the vehicle wasn't the best thing we could do. Now, that we have been for days in the Andes, we realize that the steep and inhospitable mountains are not made for such a technology. There are no more streets we can take, and we are running out of fuel. Even our provisions are used up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201045;Peruvian Sky;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201045;It was not easy to persuade Henry, but after hours of discussion he indulges. We take the 'Atalanta', an aircraft which the government provided us. After the take-off, Henry takes his diary, searching the bookmark in it. 'Manco Capac', he notes. 'The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state is searching for his remains? I didn't know that there are such optimists in the government.' His voice has turned in a sarcastical mood. Henry searched the last five years for a sign of the legends associated with Manco Capac. Manco Capac, the last glorious King of the Incas. He fought the Spanish in a rebellion. He moved from Cusco to Vilcabamba and made the latter city his new capital. The last capital of the free Incan people. The discovery of Machu Picchu made many archaeologists believe, that there could be more historical sides nearby. 'You should fly lower', Henry proposed, ' we can't see anything.' 'But there is fog, and the mountains are clouded. It is too risky', I reply. But Henry is not convinced: 'And what happens, if we overlook something?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201046;The crash;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201046;Wreckages lay lounge around. The smell of fire comes from the motor. The aeroplane is battered, pieces of metal gleam in the Andean sun. I can rescue my colleague out of the wreck. Henry is unconscious, but alive. My manouver was a bit too confident,I wasn't able to see the rough cliffs in the clouds. Our journey is over, as I decide to return to Cusco.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201047;A temple? A temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201047;We have won hight. The scenery becomes miniature. Henry, who was at first against this decision, suddenly seems interested. 'Did you see that?' 'What?' 'I bet I saw a temple! Look! There! I'm sure, on this plateau', he points with his finger on the window. A temple! Henry was right. It was buried by the mountains, but here in the sky, from above, it is clearly to see. 'We must land!', Henry becomes excited. 'Immediately!' I see the look in his face. He is a rational and cold mind, but when it comes to an archaeological discovery, Henry changes. It seems, that he can smell this type of things. But I can't share his opinion. The plateau is not the best field to land. It is not very large, and it would cost me a lot of courage to do this bold step.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201048;Temple lost out of sight;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201048;I searched for a better place to land, but when I found it, it was nearly impossible to find the place where the temple was. I made a second round to rediscover the Incan monument, but it was without success. Henry made his own expedition by foot, which resulted in failure. After weeks of useless search, we gave up hope to find the temple again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201049;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201049;I was able to land 'Atalanta', despite my concerns. The aeroplane landed softly on the plateau, and Henry jumped out of the machine when the airscrew were still moving. I follow him, looking up to the temple which is in a surprising good condition. Too untouched to be true. 'On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape', Henry mentions. 'That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished.' I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. 'Any information?', I ask, but he denies. 'That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201050;Breakfast with Llamas;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201050;Manco Capac, eh? You two are searching for the remains of the famous last Incan ruler? Follow me!' A native offered his service. Now we travel through the Peruvian mountains, our equipment and ourself carried by llamas. Henry is convinced, that a voyage with this creature, which were domisticated to reach even the most inhospitable areas of the Andes, will be more useful than the new technologies. But when I turned to him, I saw his grim face. 'Henry, what is the matter?' 'I don't trust this man', Henry answers. 'It would be better if we buy the llamas and leave him instead. For me, he knows too much.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201051;Weren't we here once before?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201051;Days and weeks go by. It took this long time after I realized, that Henry was right with his assumption. This llama leader wanted to trick us. Unfortunately, it was to late. When we wanted to confront him, he escaped with the llamas. It took us days before we were able to return to Cusco, exhausted and without equipment or success.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201052;Through the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201052;Without a leader, we are shift for ourself. The journey continues, but the problem of disorientation becomes obvious. Henry spent five years to examine Incan culture, chasing every evidence regarding the legendary capital of Manco Capac, Vilcabamba. But this area is unknown to him. Wandering through this inhabitated landscape drives us to despair. No ruins. No Incan remains. Nothing. Which direction should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201053;Lost in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201053;The blue heaven. The golden sun. Grey stones and mountains. Nothing has sense. We don't find the way to a promising archaeological place. We don't even find back home. The Andes are our grave, and maybe one day we will be found by other archaeologists, in thousands of years, making a good sample for an exhibition...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201054;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201054;The sunset brightens the sky in red colours, shining on stones. Stones of a building. On the top of a plateau, an old temple sits enthroned like an Incan god-king above the Andes. I tether the llamas, but Henry keeps going forward. 'On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape', he mentions. 'That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished.' I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. 'Any information?', I ask, but he denies. 'That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201055;War interrupts expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201055;The communication between our expedition in Peru and our archaeological society is interupted. Until the war goes on, our enemies will try to disturb every information exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201056;Expedition in Peru responds again;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201056;Immedietly after the end of the war, the expedition in Peru has contacted us again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201037;Tutankhamun's Tomb discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201037;The discovery of this archaeological sensation is an international event. What should we do now, regarding the Great powers?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201038;El Mirador discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201039;The Tower of Babel discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201058;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201058;We searched for hours, but we didn't find the entrance. A huge portal marks an area, which we identify as a possible gate, but it it is closed by a huge stone slab. Knots of alpaca hair is hanging above us, corded in strange knots. 'A quipu! At least something.' Henry seems facilitated. The Incas wrote their messages in a complicated systems of knots, why we call them also 'talking knots'. Henry is able to decipher it, but his look is confused. 'But... that can be true. The most quipus were conserved in the coast regions. In the mountains, nearly 90% are rotten.' 'Henry, please, continue the translation', I interrupt. 'We have later time for these investigations.' Henry grumbles, cathces a breath. Than he proceeds: 'Sacrifice the flesh of an animal/ the flesh of a tree/ the flesh of the sea/ and the flesh of the earth./ Finally, after five pounds of llama wool/ you will see Intis sun.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201059;The Labyrinth;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201059;We gathered the asked goods. The are forced to give up our provisions, and I sacrifice my golden pocket watch, to fullfill the 'flesh of a god' part. Lastly, we lay the llama pelts, which we took with us - fearing the cold of the night in the Andes - to the other pieces of the sacrifice, in front of the slab. 'That is ridiculous', Henry delivers. 'What comes next? Will Inti step down from the sky and open the door?' 'Do you have a better idea?' 'Maybe not a better one, but at least not so dumb like this unscientific proposal!' I want to respond, but the sound of a shattering rock breaks in. The ground trembles, shakes, and rips. The food and the wool vanish in a dark hole, together with dust and gravel. After a moment of shoke, we decide to climb down. Henry takes his rope, and after a while, we abseil in the darkness. The spark of a torch later, we stare at corridors, stairs, different floors and bizarre constructions. I never saw such an amazing compilation of dizziyng architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201060;Donwstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201060;After a hard downfall, we realize, that we are cought in a pit. I grab the torch, fire is enlightning the environment again. 'Henry?' 'Yes?' 'Why is the ground moving?' Silence follows. I lower the torch - we are surrounded by snakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201061;Upstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201061;We reach a higher level, following a passage through a tunnel. 'Something seems… similar', I notice. 'What?', Henry asks - following a strange sound, like a switch, which is now activated...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201062;It's a Trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201062;AHHHHHH!' Our screams echoes in the labyrinth, followed by the sound of the gigantic stoneball behind us. At least, we are able to escape in a save corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201063;The corridor;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201063;Reconsidering our situation, taking the corridor was a bold step. Everything seems confusing, and when we go upstairs, it seems that we go downstairs. Each step could be a trap. And there are many different routes we can chose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201064;Lost in the Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201064;Right. Left. Left. Right. Upstairs. Downstairs. Deadlock. Return. Right. Upstairs. Deadlock. Return. Return. Left. Right. Corridors, scales, floors - everywhere. I give up. We are completly lost in this strange place. There is no exit, no way out!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201065;The Sanctuary;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201065;A wide hall. Symbols and scenes decorate the walls. It seems, that we have left the labyrinth. We look up, to the ceiling, higher than 20 feet. Snakes, made of stone, surround a portal on the other side. He sits on a bench, a plate on his thighs - the food on it, which we 'sacrified'. He is skinny and old. He notices us, but doesn't react. While he is eating, we come nearer. 'Im sure, that behind this portal, there is something very imporant', I say to Henry. 'Clearly. An old, skinny man is guarding it. Every important chambered is guarded ba an old, skinny, mysterious. Hell, he lacks only a long white beard and a crusader-sword!' Henry...', I try to . Henry can become very sarcastic in such situation. 'And he is eating our provision!' 'Please, please... don't be so loud, my ears', quits the old man his meal. 'If you calm down, I'm willing to answer your questions. This is the Temple of the Sun. A holy place. And I'm the guard of the heritage of our progenitors.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201066;The Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201066;It's the duty of my family to protect this place', he begins. 'Since generations, one man in one generation takes it on. The people from the near villages come to this sanctuary, bringing food and clothes, so I can concentrade on my service. But, times are changing. And I can't protect a culture which will die. The young people in the Andes are not interested in our past or our religion.' He stands up, nodding, than he looks to us. 'I know what you want. But do you really know what you want?' 'Oh that is such a cliché. An old mysterious man is protecting an ancient place, all his life, and then, when - casually - two archaeologists come around, he spends time on philosphical phrases...' 'Henry!' 'It is true!', my colleague underlines. The old man grins. 'Anyway', he begins, 'what are you going to do?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;

encourage_italian_aircraft_desc;In the years after the Great war, Italy had taken an uncommon interest in aviation, which is even more remarkeable because of its lacking industrial capacity. Nevertheless, the unconquered territories of the sky were a field in which Italy - in relation to other countries with much larger ressources - was a leading nation. High esteem by the people and an excessive propaganda formed some of the best pilots of that time, like Italo Balbo. Italian airplanes and seaplanes were famous for establishing records, which are still unbeaten. Well, let the show begin - maybe our Minister of Aviation will be even parodied by the Marx Brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

The street is covered by an arching glass and cast iron roof, a popular design for 19th-century arcades, such as the Burlington Arcade in London, which was the prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the Saint-Hubert Gallery in Brussels (opened in 1847), the Passazh in St Petersburg (opened in 1848), or the Budapest Galleria. The Milanese Galleria was larger in scale than its predecessors and was an important step in the evolution of the modern glazed and enclosed shopping mall, of which it was the direct progenitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Italian patriots have observed the ongoing unrest in our country and drove our garrisons out of the city. Popular uprisings are spreading in our Italian depencies, building barricades, raising flags with the Italian tricolore, and shouting their battle-cry for an unified Italy. After five days, the last Austrian soldier had to draw back. Our men fought bravely, but we had no chance - these rude traitors are now in complete control of the capital of Lombardy, celebrating these 'Five Days of Milan'.

With Vienna itself in revolt, both Milan  and Venice, the main cities of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, under Austrian rule, revolted. The situation was favorable for Sardinia, which would see the full support of the lombard patriots in Milan. The Kingdom decided to exploit the moment, and attacked the weakened Austria in her Italian possessions. After a plebiscite, Milan was annexed by Sardinia, and a combined army beat the Austrians at Pastrengo. The War of Italian Independence had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202003;The Fall of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202003;The Fall of Milan was a huge blow to the Piedmontese army. The way to Turin lay open, Austrian forces had been reorganized and had rotted most of our armies. Sardinia is in a very delicate situation, and the total collapse of the country was imminent if the Austrians pressed their advance. The King, Charles Albert, has proposed that he abdicate the throne and return the provinces in Lombardy to Austria, in return for the return to the status quo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC202006;After existing as an independent maritime republic for 100 years and a leading naval power in the Mediterranean for most of that time, the Republic of Venice surrendered to Napoleon during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1797 and was ceded to the Austrian Empire (as the kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia) by the Treaty of Campo Formio a few months later. Austrian rule, after realising that mutually-agreeable home rule would not be possible, exploited Venetian resources, economically and politically, favouring Trieste as the imperial seaport. Within 50 years of their acquisition of the former republic, Austria had taken 45 million Austrian lire more from the region than had been spent there and Venetian capitalism had been stifled by a reluctance on the part of the slow, bureaucratic Habsburg régime to grant credit to Venetian entrepreneurs. In the chaos of the springtime of nations,  Daniele Manin entered the Venetian Arsenal with 'a number of public-spirited Venetians', in a direct challenge to Austrian rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

The Inno delle nazione exalted the brotherhood of man, and became a huge success, when it was performed, making a lasting impression.

He organized a new political society called La giovine Italia (Young Italy). Young Italy was a secret society formed to promote Italian unification. Mazzini believed that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy, and would touch off a European-wide revolutionary movement. Young Italy counted ca 60,000 adherents in 1833, with branches in Genoa and other cities. In that year Mazzini launched a first attempt of insurrection in Sardinia, which failed.  He organized another uprising for the following year. A group of Italian exiles were to enter Piedmont from Switzerland and spread the revolution there, and founded a new association with German and Polish refugees, called Young Europe.

EVTDESC202014;The conclave of 1846, following the death of Pope Gregory XVI (1831–46), took place in an unsettled political climate within Italy. Because of this, many foreign Cardinals decided not to attend the conclave. At its start, only 46 out of 62 cardinals were present. Moreover, the conclave of 1846 was steeped in a factional division between conservatives and liberals. Faced with deadlock, liberals and moderates decided to cast their votes for Mastai-Ferretti in a move that contradicted the general mood throughout Europe. By the second day of the conclave, on 16 June 1846, during an evening ballot, Mastai-Ferretti was elected Pope.  As liberal Europe applauded his election, he introduced political reforms on a broad scale. For the next twenty months after the election, Pius IX was the most popular man on the Italian peninsula, where the exclamation 'Long life to Pius IX!' was often heard.

EVTDESC202015;As a liberal and aware of the political pressures within the Papal States, his first act of a general amnesty for political prisoners did not consider its potential implications and consequences: The freed revolutionaries merely resumed their previous activities and his concessions only provoked greater demands as patriotic Italian groups sought not only a constitutional government, which he was sympathetic to, but also the Unification of Italy under his leadership and a war of liberation against Catholic Austria, which claimed the northern Italian provinces as its own. By early $YEAR$, all of Western Europe began to be convulsed in various revolutionary movements. The Pope, claiming to be above national interests, refused to go to war with Austria, which totally reversed the up to now popular view of him in his native Italy. In a calculated, well-prepared move, Rossi was assassinated on 15 November 1848, and in the days following, the Swiss Guards were disarmed, making the Pope a prisoner in his palace. A Roman Republic was declared.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202033;I Promessi Sposi;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202033;The Betrothed (orig. Italian: I Promessi Sposi) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years under Spanish rule, it is sometimes seen as a veiled attack on Austria, which controlled the region at the time the novel was written. I Promessi Sposi was the first Italian historical novel,  a model for subsequent Italian literary fiction and a basis for the modern Italian language. In the early 19th century, there was still some controversy as to what form the standard literary language of Italy should take. Manzoni - originally from Milan - was firmly in favour of the dialect of Florence and, after 'washing his vocabulary on the banks of the Arno' (as he put it), he revised the novel's language for its republication in 1842.  Many expressions, quotes and names from the novel are still commonly used in Italian, such as Perpetua (meaning a priest's house worker) or 'Questo matrimonio non s'ha da fare' ('This marriage is not to be performed', used ironically) and it is still considered a true masterpiece of world literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202035;Il Canto degli Italiani;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202035;Il Canto degli Italiani (The Song of the Italians) is best known among Italians as 'Inno di Mameli' (Mameli's Hymn), after the author of the lyrics, or 'Fratelli d'Italia' (Brothers of Italy), from its opening line. The words were written in $YEAR$ in Genoa, by the then 20-year-old student and patriot Goffredo Mameli, in a climate of popular struggle for unification and independence of Italy which foreshadowed the war against Austria. Two months later, they were set to music in Turin by another Genoese, Michele Novaro. The hymn enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the period of the Risorgimento and in the following decades. The hymn was also printed on leaflets in Genoa, by the printing office Casamara and published on the December 10: the demonstration was officially dedicated to the 101st anniversary of the expulsion of the Austrian powers from the city - in fact it was an excuse to protest against foreign occupations in Italy and induce Carlo Alberto to embrace the Italian cause of liberty. In this occasion the tricolor flag was shown and Mameli's hymn was publicly sung for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202038;The Legacy of Ugo Foscolo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202038;"When Italy conquered Rome, the new nation state antagonized the Papacy and was in a permament struggle with the Apostolic See. Italy favored secular movements and a new national spirit to encounter the strong catholic sentiment within the country, emulating the french state. Italian artists, philosophers or scientists were promoted, and Santa Croce in Florence became an equivalent to the Pantheon in Paris. Especially personalities with secular or atheistic views were important, like the famous Italian revolutionary and poet Ugo Foscolo. Foscolo, born on Zakynthos (the venetian Zante) in 1778 was an important figure in this new gallery of ""Secular Saints"", but unfortunately, Foscolo died in Chiswick, Western London, after eleven years of exile in England. In $YEAR$, Italy requested his remains.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202042;First wireless transatlantic transmission;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202042;At the turn of the 20th century, the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began investigating the means to signal completely across the Atlantic, in order to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, Co. Wexford in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall and Clifden in Co. Galway. He soon made the announcement that on 12 December 1901, using a 152.4-metre (500 ft) kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at Signal Hill in St John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada) signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. In $YEAR$, Marconi built a station near South Wellfleet, Massachusetts that sent a message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202045;La Mole Antoniellana;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202045;The Mole Antonelliana is a major landmark building in Turin. It is named for the architect who built it, Alessandro Antonelli. The building was conceived and constructed as a synagogue. The Jewish community of Turin - with a budget of 250,000 lire and the intention of having a building worthy of a capital city - hired Antonio Antonelli. Antonelli promised  to build a synagogue for 280,000 lire. The relationship between Antonelli and the Jewish community was not happy. He proposed a series of modifications which raised the height to 167 meters, over 46 meters higher than the dome in the original design. Such changes, in addition to greater costs and construction time than were originally anticipated, did not please the Jewish community and construction was halted in 1869, with a provisional roof. The people of Turin, who had watched the synagogue rise skyward, demanded that the city take over the project. The state considered to establish a museum dedicated to the Italian unification, reflecting the greatness of the Risorgimento - in one of the highest buildings of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202046;Macchi M.C.72;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202046;The Macchi M.C. 72 was an experimental seaplane designed and built by the Italian aircraft company Macchi Aeronautica. The M.C. 72 was built in 1931 with the idea of competing for what turned out to be the final Schneider Trophy race, but due to engine problems, the M.C. 72 was unable to compete. For two years, the M.C. 72 suffered from many mechanical defects, as well as the loss of two test pilots who died trying to coax world class speed out of the M.C. 72. After 35 flights, the engines were overhauled in preparation for a record attempt. The aircraft finally lived up to expectations when it set a new world speed record on 10 April 1933, with a speed of 682 km/h. Not satisfied, development continued as the aircraft's designers thought they could break 700 km/h with the M.C. 72. This feat was in fact achieved on 23 October 1934, when Agello piloted the M.C. 72 for an average speed of 709 km/h over three passes. The M.C. 72 held the world speed record for all aircraft for five years and remained the fastest speed ever attained by a piston-engine seaplane - until today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202047;A Visit in Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202047;In $YEAR$, the Emperor and the Empress of Austria visited Venice. The city was still aware of its lost independence, and nationalistic movements were around. In fact, the windows were locked and the streets empty. The Serenissima prepared a cold reception. Franz Josef mentioned later, that the silence 'killed more than a bullet'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202048;St Mark's Campanile;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202048;St Mark's Campanile (Campanile di San Marco in Italian) is the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, located in the Piazza San Marco. It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city. In July 1902, the north wall of the tower began to show signs of a dangerous crack that in the following days continued to grow. Finally, on Monday, July 14, around 9:45 am, the campanile collapsed completely, also demolishing the logetta. Remarkably, no one was killed, except for the caretaker's cat. Because of the campanile's position, the resulting damage was relatively limited. Apart from the logetta, only a corner of the Biblioteca Marciana was destroyed. The pietra del bando, a large porphyry column from which laws used to be read, protected the basilica itself. Nevertheless, the loss of one of the greatest symbols of old Italian culture was discuessed in the whole nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202049;The Death of Leopardi;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202049;Giacomo Leopardi was an Italian poet, essayist, philosopher, and philologist. Although he lived in a secluded town in the ultra-conservative Papal States, he came in touch with the main thoughts of the Enlightenment, and, by his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. Leopardi often wrote about poetry in general and about his own idea of poetry, of its language and scope. Many pages on this subject can be found in the Zibaldone, a private diary and collection of notes, literary projects, translations, etc. Together with Alessandro Manzoni, Leopardi hat an immense impact on the Italian language and was one figurehead of patriotic and nationalistic movements in Italy. The greatest poet of Italian Romanticism died at 38 years in Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202050;Giosuè Carducci;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202050;Giosuè Carducci, born 1835 in Valdicastello (Lucca), was an Italian poet and teacher. He was very influential and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy, being a part of the general cultural and political life. Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. His political views were consistently opposed to Christianity generally and the secular power of the Catholic Church in particular. This anti-clerical revolutionary zeal is prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative 'Inno a Satana' (Hymn to Satan). While 'Inno a Satana' had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years. His collections Rime Nuove (New Rhymes) and Odi Barbare (Barbarian Odes) contain his greatest works.  Carducci also translated some works  of Goethe and Heine into Italian. One year before his death, Carducci became the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202051;Pascoli: La grande proletaria si è mossa!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202051;Giovanni Pascoli was an Italian poet and classical scholar. He studied at the University of Bologna, where his teacher and mentor was Giosuè Carducci. Pascoli, even in a period of Positivism and scientism, believed that life is a mystery. Only symbolic associations discovered in the humble things of nature can lead man to catch a glimpse of the truth behind mere appearances. His later poems share similar themes but are more experimental, and reflect his knowledge of classical antiquity. They were a great influence on later Italian poets, who incorporated his melancholy themes into their own works. He wrote in both Italian and Latin, he also translated English poetry. Pascoli was also a political activist, sympathising with Socialism. In $YEAR$, when the War of Libia broke out, he assumed a prominent role in the public debate. Pascoli's interventionist politicis were not unique in Italian intellectual circles: his rhetoric helped to shape the public mind and to create feelings of patriotism, of fraternal pride and of a shared destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202052;Gabriele D'Annunzio;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202052;Gabriele D'Annunzio was an Italian writer, poet, journalist, playwright and soldier. He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature and political life. He was nicknamed Il Vate (The Poet) and Il Profeta (The Prophet). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism. At the height of his success, D'Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing and his work had immense impact across Europe and on generations of Italian writers. He came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. In 1897 D'Annunzio was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he sat as an independent. He collaborated with Debussy, Mascagni, Marinetti and took a flight with Wilbur Wright, becoming a pilot himself and a hero in air-battles. Not only D'Annunzio himself, but also his contemporaries viewed him as Nietzschean 'Superman'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202053;La Conoscienza di Svevo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202053;Aron Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo, was an Italian writer and businessman. Italo Svevo (literally Italian Swabian) wrote the classic novel La Coscienza di Zeno (Confessions of Zeno, or Zeno's Conscience) and self-published it in 1923. The work, showing the author's interest in the theories of Sigmund Freud, is written in the form of the memoirs of one Zeno Cosini, who writes them at the insistence of his psychoanalyst. Schmitz's novel received almost no attention from Italian readers and critics at the time. The work might have disappeared altogether if it were not for the efforts of James Joyce. Joyce had met Svevo in 1907, when Joyce tutored him in English while working for Berlitz in Trieste. Joyce championed Confessions of Zeno, helping to have it translated into French and then published in Paris, where critics praised it extravagantly. That led Italian critics to discover it. Svevo was also a model for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Joyce's Ulysses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202054;Gioachino Rossini;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202054;Gioachino Antonio Rossini was an Italian composer who wrote 39 operas as well as sacred music, chamber music, songs, and some instrumental and piano pieces. His best-known operas include the Italian comedies Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville) and La Cenerentola and the French-language epics Moïse et Pharaon and Guillaume Tell. A tendency for inspired, song-like melodies is evident throughout his scores, which led to the nickname 'The Italian Mozart'.  Until his retirement in 1829, Rossini had been the most popular opera composer in history. He returned to the Papal States, namely Bologna, where he became dircetor of music, spending his time by composing chamber and sacred music.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202055;Donizetti's Caterina Cornaro;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202055;Gaetano Donizetti was an Italian composer from Bergamo, Lombardy. Along with Vincenzo Bellini and Gioachino Rossini, he was a leading composer of bel canto opera. Following the success of Linda di Chamounix, Caterina Cornaro was commissioned by Bartolomeo Merelli, impresario of the Kaertnerthortheater in Vienna, and was partly composed in 1842/1843. The Viennese realised that the same subject had been set to music the preceding year by Franz Lachner and the debut was cancelled. Two months after the triumph of Dom Sébastien in Paris, Caterina was booed at the San Carlo in Naples. The composer, who had been unable to be present at rehearsals or to oversee the orchestration, had clearly predicted the opera's failure: 'I am anxiously awaiting news of the fiasco of Caterina Cornaro in Naples. La Goldberg as a primadonna is my first disaster without knowing it. I wrote for a soprano, they give me a mezzo! God knows if Coletti, if Fraschini intend their roles as I intend them. God knows what a catastrophe censorship has brought.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202056;Cavalleria rusticana;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202056;Cavalleria rusticana (Rustic Chivalry), is an opera in one act by Pietro Mascagni to an Italian libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti and Guido Menasci, and considered one of the classic verismo operas. Although Mascagni had started writing two other operas earlier (Pinotta, premiered in 1932 and Guglielmo Ratcliff, premiered in 1895), Cavalleria rusticana was his first opera to be completed and performed. \n\nIt remains the best known of his fifteen operas and one operetta. Its success has been phenomenal from its first performance in the Teatro Costanzi in Rome until the present day. At the time of Mascagni's death in 1945, the opera had been performed more than 14,000 times in Italy alone. The first performance of Cavalleria rusticana caused a sensation, with Mascagni taking 40 curtain calls on the opening night, and winning the First Prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202057;Fountains of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202057;Ottorino Respighi was an Italian composer, musicologist and conductor. His musicological interest in 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century music led him to also compose pieces based on the music of this period. He also wrote a number of operas, the best known being La fiamma. \n\nHe is best known for his orchestral 'Roman trilogy': Fountains of Rome (Le fontane di Roma), Pines of Rome (I pini di Roma), and Roman Festivals (Feste romane). Fountains of Rome is a sinfonic poem, seperated in four sections, depicting one of Rome's fountains during different periods of the day and night. Although the premiere in Rome was unsuccessful, Arturo Toscanini finally conducted the work in Milan in 1918 with tremendous success.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202058;Nessun Dorma…;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202058;Giacomo Puccini, considered the greatest Italian composers of opera after Giuseppe Verdi, his operas were among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire. While his early work was rooted in traditional late-19th century romantic Italian opera, he successfully developed his work in the 'realistic' verismo style, of which he became one of the leading exponents. Turandot, Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished, and the last two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer's sketches. The libretto for Turandot was based on a play by Carlo Gozzi, also called Turandot. The music of the opera is heavily inflected with pentatonic motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavor to the music. Unlike La Fanciulla, Turandot contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them Nessun dorma. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202059;Aida;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202059;Aida, sometimes spelled Aïda, is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on a scenario often attributed to French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette. Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write the opera for the performance in January $YEAR$, paying him 150,000 francs. \n\nAlthough the premiere was delayed, Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo on 24 December $YEAR$. Auguste Mariette designed the costumes and accessories and oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were created in and shipped from Paris for the premiere. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian premiere, held at La Scala, Milan, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC202061;Rigoletto is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The Italian libretto was written on the play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo. It was first performed at La Fenice in Venice in $YEAR$. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere. \n\nIt is considered by many to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career, being the first of his three 'Popular' operas (Il Trovatore and La Traviata conclude the trilogy). Rigoletto premiered to a sold out La Fenice and was a complete triumph, especially the scena drammatica, and the Duke's cynical aria, 'La donna è mobile' which was sung in the streets the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC202063;On $MONTH$, $YEAR$, the Italian writer and humanist Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi had admired all his adult life and met in 1868, died. Upon hearing of his death, Verdi resolved to complete a Requiem for the most important Italian writer of the 19th century. The Requiem was first performed in the church of San Marco in Milan and three days later at the Scala, conducted by Verdi himself. It won immediate contemporary success, and became a national celebration of arts, as two of the greatest cultural personalities of Italy - one in the field of music, one in the field of literature - merged together in an allegory of artistic spirit. As to the music qua music, the critical consensus agreed that the work displayed 'fluent invention, beautiful sound effects and charming vocal writing.' Critics were divided between praise and condemnation with respect to Verdi’s willingness to break standard compositional rules for musical effect, such as his use of consecutive fifths.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202065;Restaurazione;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202065;Following the defeat of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (1815) convened to redraw Europe. In Italy, the Congress restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments, either directly ruled or strongly influenced by the prevailing powers, particularly Austria. Since the Habsburgs controlled the predominantly Italian-speaking northeastern part of present-day Italy, it expectedly was the most powerful force against Italian unification. The Habsburgs vigorously repressed nationalist sentiment growing on the Italian peninsula, as well as in the other parts of their domains. \n\nKlemens von Metternich, an influential Austrian diplomat stated that the word Italy was nothing more than 'a geographic expression'. However, Italian artistic and literary sentiment nevertheless turned towards nationalism, provoking a climate, in which the Resurgence of Italy would occur: The Risorgimento.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
