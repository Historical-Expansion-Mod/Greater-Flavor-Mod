Governor of Buenos Aires and president of the Argentine Confederation, Juan Manuel de Rosas, received him as the constitutional president and soon offered him the command of the armies of the Argentine Confederation. Rivera, the interim president of Uruguay and leader of the Colorados, is extremely hostile to Rosas and to the Confederation thanks to the fact that Rosas and other Federalist Argentines backed Oribe in the past as well due to ideological differences.

EVTDESC600059;The political scene in Uruguay during the 1830s became split between two parties, the conservative Blancos ("Whites") and the liberal Colorados (literally "coloureds", more usually "Reds"). The Colorados were led by Fructuoso Rivera and represented the business interests of Montevideo. The Blancos were headed by Manuel Oribe, who looked after the agricultural interests of the countryside and promoted protectionism. The two groups took their names from the color of the armbands that they wore. Initially, the Colorados wore blue, but when it faded in the sun, they replaced it with red. \n \n The Uruguayan Constitution of 1830 didn't anticipate the sharing of political power between parties, which forced the minorities to resort to revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were opposed to the Argentine Federalists, who wanted a federation of independent provinces, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Unitarians, sympathetic to our government, fled Argentina in exile after being defeated in 1831. Rosas, the so called Restorer of the Laws, controlled the Argentina Confederation for too long under his despotic rule. They harbour Oribe, who claims is still president, and their government is hostile to ours. Our most trusted Caudillos argue that it is time to prepare for war and for that end we can weaken the Confederation by using our Unitarianist friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC600070;The war with Argentina and the Blancos costed too much already and our people want peace, internally and externally.

Our diplomats began the talks and the conditions the Brazilians are asking are the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of our claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil's right to interfere with our internal affairs. \n \n Getting Brazilian help would undoubtedly tip the war in our favour and it is better than to risk another Blanco government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In exchange for our help, they  are proposing several benefits for our country, such as treaties for the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of their claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil's right to interfere with Uruguay internal affairs.

EVTNAME700000;Death of Francia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC700000;Paraguayan supreme dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, took several precautions against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure there was no poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide. All shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed. Sensing his mortality, he destroyed all his papers and refused medical aid, even lashing out at a physician with his sabre. In this day, Francia breathed his last and passed away. Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years' pay. His daughter later burnt all his furniture after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A few months later, Congress changed his post from consul to president, and elected him to the new post for a 10-year term. The constitution not only legally sanctioned López' dictatorial powers, but included no guarantees of civil rights. Indeed, the word "liberty" was not even mentioned in the text.\nHis government now is directing energy towards developing the material resources and strengthening the military power of the country. One of his first actions was to strengthen Paraguay's grip on the Chaco region by building forts and founding villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC500000;The Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland was a Statute which replaced the Constitution of 1815 in the aftermath of the failed November Uprising in the Russian Partition. The Statute was pronounced in occupied Warsaw on March 1832 by Marshal Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich, who named himself a namestnik. The Statute, signed by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, replaced the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Empire with the "eternal incorporation" of Poland into Russia.

In Warsaw alone 116 demonstrations were held in $YEAR$. Much of these manifestations in ended in clashes with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. In spite of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across an important River.

EVTNAME4661006;Bolivian-Argentine Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC4661006;The border between Bolivia and Argentina has long been under influence of Caudillos from both countries, the provinces being raided and conquered numerous times. The Bolivians conquered Cochinoca, an Argentine province, using the attempt to stop Argentinian Caudillos from raiding Bolivia's countryside as the justification. After the recent war the Argentine took Cochinoca and Tarija, the latter being claimed by some Argentine northern Caudillos as being part of Argentina but that province long has been under the rule of Bolivia and has mainly a Bolivian population. Now with the post-war peace talks, our diplomats proposed that we raise the question of the settlement of the borders between Bolivia and Argentina. The best deal we can get by our diplomats calculations is to offer to renounce all our claims in Cochinoca, Uquia, Jujuy and Salta in exchange for the return of Tarija and their renouncement of their claims in that province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTPDII50000;The Republican Coup;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50000;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of "now or never". Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d'etat and tried to institute a republic on November 15, 1889. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He only commented:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vargastitle;The Rise of Getulio Vargas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vargasdesc;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME50009;The Rise of the Andinos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50009;The course of Venezuelan history changed markedly at the turn of the 20th century. In 1899 General Cipriano Castro, a caudillo from the Andean state of Táchira, descended on Caracas with his provincial army and seized the presidency. As a result, five successive military strongmen from Táchira, known as Andinos, controlled the nation for the next 59 years, except for an interlude in 1945–48. The longest rule being the one of General Juan Vicente Gómez. Gómez was an effective, if ruthless, dictator. By manipulating elections, abolishing all organized political activity, and monopolizing appointive powers, he established a completely subservient legislative and judicial structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
