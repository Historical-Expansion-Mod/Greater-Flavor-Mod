end_ottoman_domination_title;End Ottoman Domination;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_ottoman_domination_desc;The Rhomaion people have done what was long believed impossible, and have wholly routed the Ottoman armies. The city of Constantinople laid bare to the rebellion, the center of Ottoman control has been seized, and the twilight of the Turkish occupation of the holy city is at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_countryside_war_title;End the Countryside War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_countryside_war_desc;In order to bring order back into the countryside of the empire, the army must be substantially expanded in order to ensure the border regions of the empire do not fall into ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_klepht_problem_title;Ending the Klepht Domination;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_klepht_problem_desc;The Klephts remain a powerful force in the Rhomaion military, and utilize their position to extract bribes from the populace while leaving the army a disorganized mess. A substantial investment must be made into the command structure of the military if we wish to undo this corrupt influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
purge_phanariote_corruption_title;Reigning in the Phanariotes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
purge_phanariote_corruption_desc;The Phanariote class serves as a large portion of the administration of the state, and plays a major role in the diplomacy of the empire. Competent administrators, their abilities are better put to work serving the state than their own pockets, but it will take a comprehensive investment to make this become a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_church_state_within_state_title;The Church and the State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_church_state_within_state_desc;The Orthodox Church remains a dominant institution in the Rhomaion state, holding vast amounts of land titles and holding a great degree of influence in the realm of the secular. The tenuous balance of powers created by this institution must be addressed if the realm is to bring its cultural institutions into the modern realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
crack_down_rouspheti_tradition_title;Crack Down on the Rouspheti Tradition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
crack_down_rouspheti_tradition_desc;The Rouspheti tradition, the traditional giving of gifts to keep the wheels of state turning, and the dispensing of favors in exchange for political influence, is little more than another word for corruption. To do away with this practice is necessary if the state is to modernize, but investment must be made into the cultural sector of the nation in order to accomplish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reign_kodjabashi_title;Reign the Kodjabashi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reign_kodjabashi_desc;The kodjabashi as a noble institution date back to the Ottoman domination of the empire, and their influence in the state has rendered the nation as an industrially backwards state. In order to alter this, their power must first be eroded so as to render them subservient to state interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_commerce_monopoly_title;End the Commerce Monopoly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_commerce_monopoly_desc;The Phanariotes hold a monopoly on virtually all overseas commerce, and as such enforcing Rhomaion control over its own foreign trade is effectively impossible, until such time as the infrastructure is in place to abolish or integrate their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
stop_coastal_piracy_title;Put an End to the Pirates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
stop_coastal_piracy_desc;The piracy along the Aegean coastline has cost many lives and much produce from the peoples of the Rhomaion state. Only with a comprehensive growth of the naval apparatus can these pirates finally be hunted down and eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_anatolia_tur_title;Reclaim Anatolia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_anatolia_tur_desc;The Anatolian coastline in recent years has seen the mass deportation of our Turkish brethren, effectively ousting our claims to the coastline, until we can reclaim enough power for ourselves to take it once again by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
undo_byzantine_deportation_title;Undo Byzantine Deportation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
undo_byzantine_deportation_desc;If we can manage to break the Byzantine lines in Anatolia and once again secure its coastline for ourselves, we can undo the unjust deportations our people suffered, and once again secure our homeland from the invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
armenian_integration_title;Integrate the Eastern Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
armenian_integration_desc;With the initial stability of the empire secured, one matter that can be addressed is that of the eastern christians present in the realm. With no state to call their own, it would be a simple matter to integrate them as part of the administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rebuild_chios_title;Rebuild Chios;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rebuild_chios_desc;The island of Chios, once one of the greatest mercantile centers of the Aegean, was ransacked and destroyed almost in its totality during the war of independence by the Ottoman government. Over two-thirds of the population was massacred, and the region never regained its prominence in the economic sphere again. With substantial investment, however, we can restore this destroyed infrastructure and bring back at least some of its prominence in the Mediterranean trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rebuild_constantinople_title;Rebuild Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rebuild_constantinople_desc;Constantinople has been in utter disrepair since the success of the revolution, brought to ruination both by centuries of mismanagement and by the destruction of the revolution. With substantial funding and technological investment, however, the city can be brought back to functioning order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
protect_thrace_title;Protect Thrace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
protect_thrace_desc;Thrace has been a vulnerable frontier to the city of Constantinople since long before the Ottoman conquest, an open route to the holy city for any balkan power that seeks to destroy the empire. If the Basileia tos Rhomaion is to recover its standing on the world stage, the first and highest priority must be to reclaim this frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_bulgaria_title;Reclaim Bulgaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_bulgaria_desc;Bulgaria has long been the thorn in the empire's side, a powerful rival on the Balkan frontier that has never been quite done away with. If the empire is to ever reclaim its glory, the Bulgarians must be stamped out as a rival in the Balkan sphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_western_balkans_title;Reclaim the Western Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_western_balkans_desc;The western Balkans were the stomping grounds of the ancient Roman Empire well into the Middle ages, and historically comprised its sphere of influence until the 4th Crusade. With Bulgarian resistance stamped out, it is finally time to restore this frontier's integrity once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_anatolia_title;Reclaim Anatolia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_anatolia_desc;Finally, the time has come to bring the Anatolian countryside under control once and for all, and to bring the full weight of the Basileia tos Rhomaion to bear against the Turkish threat once and for all, and to undo the disaster of Manzikert all those centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
renovate_constantinople_title;Renovate Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;
renovate_constantinople_desc;The city of Constantinople has been recovered and repaired from its ruinous state, but much work still remains to be done. The financial institutions of the city need to be restored, and the infrastructure of the city itself is aged and worn. In order to bring the city to modern standards, much will need to be imported from foreign realms, and the cost will be truly enormous.;;;;;;;;;;;;
renovate_trebizond_title;Restore the Jewel of the Black Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
renovate_trebizond_desc;Trebizond, the jewel of the Black Sea, has long languished over the slow decline of the Ottoman presence in the black sea. The city, which once served as the greatest settlement along the coastline, and the key to controlling the Black sea, as well as the capital of the short-lived empire of Trebizond, still holds much value that can be restored, should the right investments be made.;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_armenia_title;Avenge Manzikert;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_armenia_desc;The legacy of the battle of Manzikert still haunts the Basileia tos Rhomaion, a stain on its otherwise glorious legacy, the wound that slowly bled the empire to death under the yoke of the Turkish invasions. If the empire is to ever proclaim itself as the true hegemon of the Middle East once more, it must reclaim these distant lands and undo the humiliation it suffered so long ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_theme_system_title;Restore the Theme System;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_theme_system_desc;The Theme system was a system of bureaucracy wherein the provinces of the empire were managed as landed realms handed in trust to the military officer corps, ruled by the state and appointed based on competence on the field. While restoring the exact specifications of the system would be foolhardy, the system could be used as inspiration to greatly increase assimilation across the realm, by selectively appointing those favorable to our empire to positions of power, slowly displacing local populations in favor of more favorable ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
renovate_smyrna_title;Renovate Smyrna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
renovate_smyrna_desc;The city of Smyrna has long been the center of Greek civilization along the Anatolian coastline, ever since the days of the ancient Hellenes, long before the days of Rome. While not as prestigious as Constantinople or Trebizond, the city holds a special place in the history of our nation, and deserves similar treatment, especially since it sits in an advantageous position for Mediterranean trade, and has historically been a major regional trade node.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_levant_title;Reclaim the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_levant_desc;The Levant was long the financial heartland and eastern frontier of the Basileia tos Rhomaion, and its loss devastated the imperial coffers, leaving the remaining provinces severely depleted. Reclaiming the province, while it may not hold the same value it once did, will demonstrate thoroughly the recovery the empire has made in recent decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_egypt_title;Reclaim Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_egypt_desc;The Egyptian breadbasket was once the heartland of Rhomaion agriculture, the breadbasket from which the empire procured the vast majority of its produce from. With the restoration of the empire to the glory it once enjoyed, for the first time in many centuries, this breadbasket sits open to the empire for the taking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_constantinople_title;Expand Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_constantinople_desc;The city of Constantinople has been restored and modernized to the specifications of a modern city, on line with Western models. However, this still is not yet far enough. If the empire is to showcase its splendor to a degree never seen before, its cities must reflect that, and reach a level of development that will cause even the great powers of the West to look to in surprise and adoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
seize_ionian_islands_title;Seize the Ionian Islands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
seize_ionian_islands_desc;The Ionian Islands have been occupied by the British empire ever since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and serve as a weak western flank to the Rhomaion empire. With the continual downturn of relations between us and the British Empire, the possibility of seizing the islands by force becomes an increasingly prevalent idea in military circles. With the aid of locals whom know the terrain, the sparse English positions can easily be overrun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgk_line_title;The Schomburgk Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgk_line_desc;Following the dissolution of Gran Colombia, its unsettled and remote eastern frontier in Essequibo has been left unorganized and unprotected. Following our acquisition of Guyana from the Dutch, we inherited a territorial dispute over Essequibo with Gran Colombia which disputed the former Spanish treaty. Thus we have legal justification to seize this patch of jungle without conflict. The Royal Geographical Society of London recommends we send Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk to explore the region and delineate a proper border with Venezuela, as his work on surveying the Virgin Island of Anegada was quite impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgkexplained;Abusing flimsy claims of inheritance of responsibilites from treaties between Spain and the Dutch, Great Britain has occupied Essequibo. With our recently nascent country barely posessing an army of note, there is nothing we can do to resist the Brits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORDEATH;After resigning from the presidency, Bol var made his way to Cartagena de Indias to board a ship and settle down abroad. However, he rested in the Customs House of Santa Marta as his health made travel difficult. As his condition worsened, he needed a transfer to a quieter place and moved to a farm located in San Pedro Alejandrino on the outskirts of the city, where he entered the full care of his trusted family doctor. Initially optimistic, both he and his doctor eventually recognized the severity of the condition, leading to Bol var writing his will and instructing his entourage how to proceed in the event of his death. \nAfter the passage of morning marked by an increasing decline of vital signs, the silence of the house's main hall, occupied by the aides, military leadership of the Patriot Army and Bol var's closest friends, was interrupted by the words of his doctor inviting them to the next room to witness the great liberator's last moments. Surrounded by his entourage, and after a long but calm agony, Sim n Bol var died at 1 PM, 3 minutes and 55 seconds on Friday, December 17, 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORSLASTWORDS;'Colombians: You have witnessed my efforts to raise freedom where tyranny once reigned. I have worked with selflessness, abandoning my fortune and even my tranquility. I separated from command when I was persuaded that you distrusted my detachment. My enemies abused your credulity and they trampled on what is most sacred to me, my reputation and my love of freedom. I have been a victim of my persecutors, who have led me to the doors of the tomb. I forgive them. As I disappear from your midst, my affection tells me that I must make a manifestato of my last wishes. I do not aspire to any other glory than the consolidation of Colombia. All of you must work for the inestimable good of the Union: The people obeying the government to be free from anarchy, the ministers of the sanctuary directing their prayers to heaven, and the military using their sword to preserve the peace. Colombians! My last wishes are for the happiness of the country. If my death contributes to the end of the parties and the consolidation of the Union, I shall go to the grave in peace.'   -Sim n Bol var;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_title;The Apulo Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_desc;Gran Colombia is doomed. Without Bol var, no force is strong enough to hold it together. With Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama in open revolt, Perhaps it would be better to face the facts and abandon the dream rather than spill more blood. President Rafael Urdaneta cannot handle the situation and has called for a convention to put an end to Gran Colombia and create a new state with a new constitution to consolidate what remains of our once great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORRESIGNS;Since 1828, Sim n Bol var has attempted to keep Gran Colombia together by assuming dictatorial powers to deal with the emergencies at hand. He has finally seen that this course of action has kept the union together but divided it ever more severely. He has now arrived at the conclusion that it would be best for Gran Colombia if he, El Libertador, resigned and left the presidency to a less divisive person. This however creates ever more uncertainty. Gran Colombia has always had Bol var at its helm, what will happen now that he has left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES;Led by traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence following the example of Venezuela and Ecuador. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived unlike those in Venezuela and Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSECEDES;Informed of the secession of Venezuela and Bol var's death, the assembly of the district of the South has declared independence, founding the state of Ecuador. The departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are now under the supreme rule of Juan Jose Flores, the head of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASECEDES;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of hero of the wars against Spain, General Jos  Antonio P ez who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata that occurred between 1826 and 1829. While the assembly's rhetoric was anti-Bolivarian from the start, once it had been informed of Bol var's death, it took a turn for a worse. The assembly ultimately ceremoniously announced its independence from Gran Colombia as the state of Venezuela under the leadership of General P ez himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAQUESTION;General Tom s Herrera has lead a counterrevolt against Juan Eligio Alzuru to put an end to Panamanian independence and repatriate to Colombia. While his revolt is seeing a lot of success, he needs the support of the people. The question lies in their loyalty to Colombia. Will they work towards continued self-sovereignty or reintegration to Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS;Executed by General Tom s Hererra, Alzuru's revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope the same may occur in Venezuela or Ecuador, but those hopes are clearly in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

clm_const_1832_desc;Now that the situation has stabilized, the constitutional assembly has finished its deliberations and formulated a constitution. It establishes the seperation of powers, the responsibilities of public officials, the duty to protect the catholic church and the unitary form of government with decentralized local assemblies. Furthermore, it divides congress into an upper and lower house and sets its legislative terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADMIRABLECONGRESS;Sim n Bol var's years as dictator of Gran Colombia have done the union no good. His unquestioned reign has even been compared by many to that of the kings of Spain. Recognizing what is best for the union, he has called for a new constitutional assembly to create a constitution for Gran Colombia in a last-ditch effort to prevent its dissolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE;After much trial and tribulation, Gran Colombia is united once more. El Libertador can rest easy knowing that the Bolivarian legacy shall continue. However, now that the crisis of secession is averted, we must ask ourselves what lies in our future. How will we govern ourselves to ensure that Gran Colombia will survive and not collapse once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERTHYRRISING;Some days ago riots started in the town of Merthyr Tydfil, north of Cardiff, and today there are already reports of it expanding into all Wales, being an all-out rebellion. It's the first time a red flag is seen in a workers' revolt, being a symbol of the workers. They protest against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment, and among the shouts were cries of "Caws a bara" (cheese and bread), "Annibyniaeth" (independence) and "I lawr gyda'r Brenin" (down with the king), being a clear threat to the monarchy. Do we give them more rights or we protect the monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWYORKSECONDFIRE;On a night in 1835, a fire broke out in a five-story warehouse at 25 Merchant Street, at the intersection of Hanover Street. As it spread, gale-force winds blowing from the northwest towards the East River spread the fire. It could be seen from Philadelphia, approximately 80 miles away. At the time of the fire, major water sources were frozen in temperatures as low as -17 F, forcing the firefighters to drill holes to access liquid water, which later refroze around the houses and pipes. Efforts were made to deprive the fire of fuel by demolishing surrounding buildings, but there was insufficient gunpowder. Later in the next evening, a detachment of U.S. Marines returned with gunpowder and stopped the fire. During the day and a half that it burned, the fire killed 2 civilians and in total destroyed 660 buildings, resulting in property damage estimated between 20-25 million.

EVTDESC127854;3 days ago Nat Turner, an enslaved African-American preacher, had organizad a rebellion of enslaved and free Black people in Southampton County, Virginia. Turner was recorded as "Nat" by Benjamin Turner, the man who enslaved him and his family. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, under then-current laws which made slavery legal, Nat was inherited as property by Benjamin's son Samuel Turner. On February 12, 1831, he witnessed a solar eclipse that was visible from much of the southeastern United States, and was convinced that it was the sign for which he was waiting. He began preparations for an uprising against the enslavers in Southampton County by purchasing muskets. The last 3 days they have been waging terror in Southampton, but have been stopped today by local militias and detachments of men from the USS Natchez and USS Warren. Approximately 120 black people died today, and around 60 white people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC127855;Turner eluded capture for six weeks, but remained in Southampton County. On October 30, a White farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people, in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. While awaiting trial, Turner confessed his knowledge of the rebellion to attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray, who compiled what he claimed was Turner's confession.

The Afrikaners (Dutch-Africans) still has the vast majority of the european population in the Cape Colony and during the last years the Afrikaners feel that they've been treated unfairly, especially when we declared in 1828 that the native Africans were to have human rights, when we declared English as the official language of the region when most Afrikaners spoke no English and just now, when we abolished slavery (Historically in 1834).

It is to be constructed in a star shape, with barracks lining its banks on three sides and a citadel on an island in the center. The fort will accommodate 12,000 soldiers in total.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEATHSUCRE;Antonio Jos  de Sucre y Alcal  or the 'Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho' has been found dead on a a trail leading South. Sucre, a brilliant general and tactician who led the pro-independence forces to victory against the Spanish royalists in the decisive battles of Pichincha and Ayacucho, was perhaps Sim n Bol var's greatest ally. After vanquishing the Spaniards, he served as president of Bolivia until a strong anti-Bol varian movement led to his resignation. In face of the imminent collapse of Gran Colombia, he headed South to discourage the secession of Ecuador. Seeing the danger that a beloved hero of the war of independence poses to their plot, the pro-Ecuadorian elements under Juan Jos  Flores hired an assassin to murder Sucre, preventing his interference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

osterreichische_lloyd_desc;Several sea transport insurance companies, banking houses and numerous individual shareholders, among them the Austrian politician Karl Ludwig von Bruck, have come together to form a shipping company. Based in Trieste, it would begin constructing new steamers to transports passengers and goods and bring news from overseas. With this much backing, the company would be sure to become the prime shipping company in the Austrian Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051839;The Palace of Westminster has burned down today in a sudden conflagration. According to the investigation on the ground, a bundle of tally sticks used for accounting by the Exchequer was disposed of in two underfloor stoves under the House Floors, which caused a chimney fire. The fire then seeped through the building and caused the walls to catch fire as well. Before it was put out, flames engulfed all of Westminster Palace and left intact only five of its buildings. Reconstruction will have to begin immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160518411;After the loss of Central America by the Mexican Empire, secessionist movements both by Hispanic and indigenous nationalists have plagued our fledgling state of $COUNTRY$. Anastasio Aquino, a leader of the Nahualco indigenous people, has staged a rebellion in the department of La Paz after his brother was arrested by the owner of the hacienda the two worked on. He soon amassed an army of over 2,000 men and attacked towns across La Paz. His army will require the mobilization of our troops the way all-out war would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

antoine_clot_desc;A French doctor named Antoine Clot has held an esteemed medical practice in Egypt for 5 years as Surgeon-in-Chief of the Armies. Before he arrived from France, our country did not yet have a medical care system: since then he has worked as director of the first medical school in Egypt, Kasr al-Aini Medical School, and even has been made chief surgeon for Muhammad Ali Pasha. Clot is a force of Egypt's modernization. With this modernization comes a need to bring women into the fold. We should grant Clot's request to open a women's medical school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PRIESTJOVICA;The always separatist-minded Serbs have launched a rebellion against us in Bosnia, led by a radical Orthodox priest named Jovica Ilic. It was sparked when Ilic petitioned former Prince Milo  Obrenovic for support for an armed revolt, then met with fellow priests who each agreed to help organize participants. Violence is currently concentrated in Tuzla and around Banja Luka. With Prince Milos' support, this rebellion can prove dangerous down the road. Should we allow the Serbs and Croats to ever get any silly ideas again, after Serbia's short-lived independence from 1804 to 1817?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051840;In the rural town of Uster, Z rich canton, locals gathered today in a peaceful assembly to protest the overrepresentation of the cantonal capital compared to Z rich's rural parts. They argue that Uster's livelihood has been neglected, causing its locals to languish in poverty and remain largely uneducated. They also call for a new constitution to overhaul the governance of all Switzerland's cantons. For citizens to call for the constitution's repeal or amendment is unheard of: they are legally prohibited from petitioning the government to make such changes. Neverless, the liberal ideas left behind by Napoleon's rule clearly are still showing their influence. This will definitely not be the last call by our people for fair representation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051841;Never before have our people made such strong demands against our government while also not shedding a drop of blood. Today, discontent locals in the Freiamt region of Aargau canton led an uprising in protest of reduced rural representation in the constitution. They demonstrated their resolve by organizing themselves into militias. Despite clashes across Freiamt where about 6,000 total militia members confronted Swiss forces--with both sides prepared to engage--not a single shot was fired. Miraculously, the government agreed to a revision to the constitution and negotiated an end to the uprising. This marks an indelible end to the illiberal, undemocratic government before Napoleon's time, where the government could get away with unequal or unfair representation of the people. Aargau was ruled particularly heavy-handedly by governor Johannes Herzog, who has been claimed to want to run a duchy instead of a canton. Well, his tyranny ends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051843;The tyrannical general Resid Mehmed has at long last acted on the Ottomans' behalf to tighten their choke hold on the Albanian people. The general invited 500 Albanian beys to attend a meeting where they would be rewarded for their loyalty to their government. When they arrived, the beys were greeted by a military procession--but the next thing they knew, upon a hand signal from Mehmed, the Turkish soldiers opened fire on the beys and killed them all. \n\nThe Ottomans have removed the one element in the government we could count on to stop our full annexation. Lest we let our dream of an independent Albania die out, we must rally our people and declare a war for our liberation against the Ottomans--right now. Our surviving political leaders have already organized soldiers to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051844;General Resid Mehmed has taken rash action to tighten our grip on the administration in Albania by committing a massacre against Albanian beys, traditional chieftains. About 500 of them were invited to a meeting where they were told they were to be rewarded for their loyalty to the government at. They attended, and after their arrival they were greeted by a ceremonial solute parade of soldiers, which was in fact an ambush. Upon a sign from Resid Mehmed, they fired upon the beys, slaughtering them all. This massacre comes as a response to the behavior of the Pashaliks of Yanina and Shkodra, who had ambitions to finally create an independent Albania. But the Albanian people will not stand for this--they have already taken up arms to challenge our forces head-on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GREATMOONHOAX;A series of articles anonymously published in New York newspaper The Sun are causing a stir. They claim there exists not only life but an entire civilization on Earth's moon, with no one having previously observed them. It features fantastical illustrations of the moon's geography and creatures such as a man with bat wings, which the articles claim are common inhabitants on the moon. These claims are clearly false, but they nevertheless have proven beneficial for The Sun's circulation, allowing the paper to claim a new height of success. The articles' author, meanwhile, has yet to be revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRSTCANUTREVOLT;Lyon, a city dominated by silk-based manufacturing, has descended into chaos in the wake of riots by silk workers, who are known in French as canuts. The workers, reacting to a drop in wages, are demanding a minimum price to be imposed on silk products and seized weapons from the national guard to enforce this demand. They soon engaged the national guard and the military in battle, leaving Lyon entirely in their hands. However, the government was able to retake the city without further bloodshed and without conceding to the workers' demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

france_bullies_algeria_desc;Tension between France and the Deylik of Algiers, an autonomous part of the Ottoman Empire, has escalated due to Algerian pirates raiding European ships. With these Barbary Pirates being a major thorn in our backside, it's about time we show them their place and conquer Algiers for ourselves. We even have the perfect casus belli: a provocation by Hussein Dey, who struck the French consul, Pierre Deval, with a fan during a heated argument over both countries' trade debts to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONCEPCIONEARTHQUAKE;A devastating earthquake has hit Concepci n and nearby Talcahuano today at 11:30 AM. The quake combined with a resulting tsunami have left Concepci n destroyed, with most buildings in ruins. Miraculously, though, casualties have remained low, with only 50 people reported dead. The lack of deaths is attributable to how the quake was slow to intensify and happened at about high noon, allowing locals to get to safety in time. Charles Darwin happened to be in Concepci n as the earthquake struck, on a stop for the second voyage of the HMS Beagle. He would describe the quake as such: "I happened to be on shore, and was lying down in the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly, and lasted two minutes, but the time appeared much longer. The rocking of the ground was very sensible . . . The people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm. It is these accompaniments that create that perfect horror of earthquakes, experienced by all who have thus seen, as well as felt, their effects.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
PHILIPE1ASE1;An assassination attempt was made on King Louis-Philippe today at the hands of Republican terrorists. During a royal procession held near the Place de la R publique in Paris, conspirators Giuseppe Marco Fieschi, Theodore P pin, and Philippe Morey discharged a homemade volley gun with 25 barrels at the King and his soldiers. The barrage killed 18 people but only minorly wounded Louis-Philippe, and Fieschi was immediately captured. \n\nIt has since then been discovered that four barrels of the volley gun did not fire due to the components' failure. Surely more would have died, including the King, had the weapon worked as intended. Fieschi is imprisoned and awaiting trial, while P pin and Morey are still at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZAKHOISSORAN;We were established in 1399 and subjugated by the Turks in 1554. We stayed their peacable vassal for several centuries until Mir Mohammed proclaimed himself "Emir Mansur"--an independent ruler. We have since then expanded our army and begun waging war on neighboring principalities, hoping to become the dominant Kurdish tribe. But now, we have gone a bridge too far for the Ottomans--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of the Emirate of Bohtan, which is a Turk vassal. This can only end badly. . .;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZAKHOISBOHTAN;The Emirate of Soran was established in 1399 and subjugated by us in 1554. It stayed our peacable vassal for several centuries until the ambitious Mir Mohammed proclaimed himself "Emir Mansur"--an independent ruler. He has since then expanded his army and begun waging war on neighboring principalities, hoping for Soran to become the dominant Kurdish tribe. But now, he has gone a bridge too far--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of our vassal the Emirate of Bohtan.

fund_french_settlement_in_algeria_desc;Although our New World colonies are gone, our settler-colonial ventures are not yet over, still going strong in Algeria. But more often than not, these settlers will need a considerable amount of funding to ensure their livelihood in the new land. Thus, as the mother nation, it is seen as our duty to provide for their needs. The question is how much money we shall offer them, if at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGADEADAF;With our newfound victory over the Algerians, we must continue the fight against the tribesmen who are holding out, rallying in the hinterland against colonial rule. Hussein Bey, the former ruler of Algeria has fled to his strongholds in the East surrounding Constantine, as the populace has lost all confidence in his rule due to his defeat. In this power vacuum, a new figure has emerged: Abdelkader ibn Muhieddine, a minor sharif and islamic scholar has rallied the tribes to resist us in unison. We know, however that such backwards, unorganized rabble cannot stop us! Soon, all of Algeria shall be ours! Vive la France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCETROLLED;France has pathetically attempted to conquer our great nation, and they have failed, as they had failed in Egypt in 1800, Haiti in 1804, and Russia in 1812.

TUZCUOGLUREVOLTS;A rebellion has risen within the Sanjak of Lazistan, resisting the installment of derebeys--local governors--who are cruel and care most about consolidating Ottoman control. This comes as a result of a blood feud between the Hazinedaroglu and Tuzcuoglu families, both of whom have vied for control of Lazistan as derebeys. Derebey Adjara Osman Hazinedaroglu has used his authority to levy large taxes on his subjects, which contributed to food scarcity in 1829 and 1830. Locals have now begun to stop paying taxes and rebel, with rival Derebey Tahir Aga Tuzcuoglu as their leader. We cannot allow Tuzcuoglu to continue his defiance. We must put an end to the rabble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUZCUOGLUCRUSHED;Lazistan has been pacified and plundered by our army. With the Tuzcuoglu family removed from power, we can tighten our grip on the province and ensure its governors will be unconditionally loyal to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

uruguay_const_1830_desc;Inspired by the liberal ideas of the American and French revolutionaries, calls for a constitution firmly establishing Uruguay as a representative democracy are echoing within the government. Under this constitution, Uruguay will be represented by a president and a two-chamber legislative branch consisting of the Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Senators. Meanwhile, supreme legal power will be put in the hands of the Supreme Court of Justice. The constitution will also strengthen the federal government's authority--so much so that our country will be considered a unitary republic. Nevertheless, the constitution's passing will be a firm, welcomed step in the direction toward equality and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_title;The Anglo-Ashanti Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_desc;Border conflicts with the Ashanti Empire have been a constant occurrence since we first established our colony on the Gold Coast. With it obvious, though, that the Ashanti cannot fully repel our troops and retake that land, perhaps we should send them an ultimatum. We shall force an agreement that our borders will lie on the opposite banks of the Pra River, the natural boundary of the Gold Coast colony. Of course, there's nothing stopping us from eventually breaking this treaty and conquering them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051835;Border conflicts with the British are continuing with no end in sight, lest one of us falls entirely or agrees to peace terms. Britain has come to us with an ultimatum: that we recognize their sovereignty over the Gold Coast colony and share a natural border along the Pra River. This will put us at peace for the meantime and, unfortunately, leave our brethren on the coast at Britain's whim. But war is tiring, and we've certainly had our share of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051836;The Ashanti have accepted our peace offer. We can lay down our arms and rest assured that the next time we go to war with them, they will stand no chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051837;Our peace offer to the Ashanti Empire is dead in the water.

romania_semiconst_1831_title;The Regulamentul Organic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romania_semiconst_1831_desc;While the Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moladvia are Ottoman vassals, we have retained garrisons in them since the war of 1828-29. The populace is becoming increasingly resentful of this, especially as we have confiscated Wallachia and Moldavia's treasuries for the time being. It is up to us to shape their governments for the better and hand them back control over their finances. The proposed Organic Regulation would form the organic law, or legal system forming the basis of government, of the principalities. It would establish a national assembly in Iasi and Bucharest elected by no more than 3000 of the most influential citizens. Furthermore, the Organic Regulation would, among other things, ensure the independence of the judiciary and establish a poll tax in place of the old indirect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REGULAMENTULORGANIC;Russia has imposed a legal system forming the basis of government on us:  the so-called Regulamentul Organic, or "Organic Regulation." This semi-constitutional document returns to us the Russian-confiscated treasury, establishes a national assembly elected by the three thousand most influential citizens, ensures the independence of the judiciary and replaces the old indirect taxes with a poll tax among many other reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REFORMISTREVOLUTION;The government of Jos  Mar a Vargas has become opposed by a growing movement for the restoration of Gran Colombia. The rebels are led by heroes of the war of independence, including Santiago Mari o, Diego Ibarra and Jos  Laurencio Silva, all formerly loyalists to the bolivarian cause. They have rallied their forces in the city of Maracaibo and begun marching East to take Caracas. Now, in turn, Jos  Antonio P ez, the man who split Venezuela from Gran Colombia and spelled its doom has returned from retirement and assembled militia to join the struggle on the government's side. It seems that the old rivalry between proponents and detractors of Gran Colombia is to play out one final time--on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_title;The Peruvian Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_desc;Now that the Bermudists have been defeated, we can finally set about finishing the new constitution. The proposed draft mostly reiterates the 1828 constitution and follows its liberal spirit but makes some adjustments to combat instability which has been experienced since. For example, the post of vice-president would be removed due to the bad contact of former VP Antonio Guti rrez de la Fuente. Another example is the prohibition of immediate presidential reelection, a tactic used by August n Gamarra to elongate his presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCONGRESSPRU;The 1828 Constitution had agreed that in 1833, five years later, a new constitution would be formulated to adapt to the new situation of our country and possibly implement a federal system. Thus, a constitutional congress has gathered and heald a vote to elect a provisional president until the new constitution is finished. Pretenders for the position were the liberal Luis Jos  de Obregoso, the conservative Pedro Pablo Berm dez and the independent Domingo Nieto. Obregoso won with 47 votes to Berm dez's 36 and Nieto's 1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCIVILWAR;Pedro Pablo Berm dez has rejected the result of the constitutional convention's election of Jos  de Obregoso and risen up in revolt, beginning a civil war. While Berm dez enjoys the support of most of the army, the populace of Lima and Arequipa are on the side of Obregoso, forcing Bermudist troops to retreat from the cities, unable to capture them with the adamant opposition of the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Basic freedoms such as that of expression, worship, and the press will be guaranteed. However, only landed subjects will be able to vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANANTHEM;La Braban onne, the song that has become a rallying cry and source of Belgian nationalism, was not, in fact, been written by a Belgian. A French mercenary serving in Brussels, known by the alias Jenneval, composed the original poem the song is based on before dying in action. The title refers to inhabitants of the region of Brabant, where Brussels is located. The poem originally scolded rioters during the revolution and claimed the Dutch Prince of Orange would be the "example of kings" and "father of Belgians" if he granted Belgium independence. However, following the bombardment of Antwerp, he wrote a second version condemning the Dutch for their brutality. An arrangement with the second version's lyrics, set by Fran ois van Campenhout to the tune of "L'Air des lancers polonais" ("Song of the Polish Lancers"), has immediately gained popularity among our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKING;Although our constitution declares us a constitutional monarchy, as of yet we lack a monarch. Three options have been debated: Firstly, the Duke of Nemours, son of revolutionary king Louis-Philippe of France. Secondly, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a member of the British royal house. Thirdly, a minor noble. The French candidate, while ensuring French protection would surely be concerning to the UK and Prussia who would see it as an increase in revolutionary influence in Europe. On the other hand, the British candidate would probably have some strings attached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRANCE;Belgium has sent us an emissary to propose the coronation of the Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe as king of Belgium. While this would give us much influence over Belgium, it would surely attract the ire of the British and Prussians. Additionally, Belgium's industry, which is larger than ours, would, by increased interaction with our economy, hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRBEL;King Louis-Philippe has given the go-ahead to the coronation of the Duke of Nemours. Celebrations have begun amid his arrival in Brussels. Belgium finally has a king, and a popular one at that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSABONKFR;The Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe of France, has been crowned king of Belgium at the bequest of the provisional government. This act spreads the influence of the French revolution further throughout Europe and endangers the old order. With the Louis-Philippe's son on the throne, Belgium is now a French protectorate in all but name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNO;Louis-Philippe has refused to let his son become king of France. The reason he gives for this is twofold: On the one hand, he does not wish to raise the ire of the other European powers, specifically Prussia and the UK, by extending his influence. On the other hand, Belgium's industry far outmatches France's and economic intermingling between the two would hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGBRIISH;Belgium has sent us an emissary proposing the coronation of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as their king. While it would definitely increase our influence on Belgium, we would get mixed up in their ongoing conflict with the Dutch. An agreement called the "Treaty of the Eighteen Articles" has been proposed which would agree to the coronation of Leopold under the condition that the matters of Limburg and Luxembourg are for Britain to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNOBLE;The British have outright refused to let Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha become our king, wanting to have nothing to do with our revolutionary state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BELGIUMINDEPENDENCE;Rebel leaders have formed a provisional government to cooperate and organize the revolt into a formidable united force. Today, they have finally declared the independence of "Belgium," a Catholic state encompassing Luxembourg, Wallonia, Flanders and Limburg. All these lands are, aside from a few forts still held by our troops, in the hands of the rebels. They have already begun reaching out to other European powers in pursuit of recognition. After the disaster in the September Days, our army is in too much disarray to fight. Our only option is biding our time and invading once we have built up our strength and licked our wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEPTEMBERDAYS;A force of 12,000 soldiers under the leadership of Prince Frederick marched into Brussels, determined to restore order. Yet they were completely unprepared for the challenge they faced: seemingly every inhabitant is on the side of the rebellion. The soldiers were embattled from all sides and constantly under fire. The raw ferocity and determination of the populace brought the organized army to its knees, unable to hold in face of such opposition. After four days of fighting, they were routed and fled North in disarray. This humiliating defeat has solidified the rebels' position and cast doubt on whether we shall ever be able to retake the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRUSSELSRIOTS;Tensions have long been rising in our Catholic southern provinces due to grievances, including but not limited to the following: underrepresentation of Catholics in the General Assembly, the south having to pay for the larger debt of the north, Protestant domination of government ministries, and inadequate freedoms of press and assembly. With news of the successful recent revolution in France, the situation has escalated. A large group of opera-goers began rioting in the streets after attending The Mute Girl of Portici, a sentimental and patriotic opera set during an Italian 17th-century uprising against Spanish rule. Droves of inhabitants joined the mob, which proceeded to storm government offices. Now, a day later, the mayhem has only worsened, spreading across the south and driving our forces into retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANENG;France has proposed that we partition Belgium instead of recognizing it. We would receive Ghent and Antwerp, while France would get Wallonia and Brussels, Prussia would be given Luxemburg and Li ge, and the Dutch would receive Limburg and Hasselt. Antwerp's port would be the most likely to be used to launch an invasion of our isles with its large, close port. Thus, its control would be immensely beneficial to our defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANPRU;France has proposed that we partition Belgium instead of recognizing it. We would receive Luxemburg and Li ge, while France would get Wallonia and Brussels, the UK would be given Ghent and Antwerp, and the Dutch would receive Limburg and Hasselt.

THEFLAHAUTPLANFAILS;Other powers in Europe have refused to agree to the Flahaut plan, denouncing it as unjust to the Belgian cause and unfairly imbalanced to favor us. Thus, without support of the others, the plan cannot go ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ASSAMQUESTION;The Assamese kingdom of Kachari was assisted by British forces in its liberation from Burmese occupation in the Anglo-Burmese War. It makes up part of the larger region of Assam, a strip of land above Bengal comprising the fertile Brahmaputra river valley.

The king we have in mind is Purandar Singha, a prince of the Ahom Kingdom.

Helping them is tempting, as it weakens the Netherlands and allows us to possibly place a new country on our border under our thumbs. Our people will also doubtlessly sympathize with Belgium's Walloons, who speak a Gallo-Romance dialect similar to French and were made our subjects during Napoleon I's rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OHWELLDUTCHNVASIONET;The rebels now have French backing. Should we continue our counterrevolution, we will need to contend with possible war with France, which would mean digging a hole for ourselves we may not be able to climb out of. Yet our dream of the Low Countries' unification still burns in our hearts. Is it worth surrendering that righteous dream now?;;;;;;;;;;;;

LONDONPROTOCOL;The Western great powers have convened to recognize the independence of Greece and organize it in their image as a European-style monarchy. They have agreed that Greece's borders shall span from the Cyclades to just below Thessaly, creating a small but regionally significant state friendly to Western Europe's interests in the Mediterranean. However, we will still keep a large majority of ethnically Greek lands, including Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace, while Egypt will be ceded Crete for helping suppress the revolt there.

spanish_inquisition_desc; GLose 1 infamy ! The Tribune of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, commonly called the Spanish Inquisition, is the police force responsible for enforcing strict observance of Catholicism in the Spanish Empire. Established at the end of the Reconquista, it oversaw the mass conversion and expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain, and since then it has been responsible for enforcing the consolidation of the Spanish crown's rule by ensuring Catholicism unites its disparate subjects. But the Inquisition is not what it used to be. It was temporarily abolished under Joseph Bonaparte's reign and was reinstated by Ferdinand VII in 1814. Liberalism continues to weaken the Inquisition's strength to eradicate Christian heteroodoxy. The organization has been reduced to a censorship committee, rarely overseeing prosecutions anymore. Perhaps it is time to disband the Inquisition and bury its legacy in the sand dunes of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLEOFPESHAWAR;Sudden as a lightning strike, Ranjit Singh has conquered Peshawar and made it part of his Sikh Empire.

It would be easy to conquer due to its relative separation from the rest of Afghanistan: The only way to get from Kabul to Peshawar is via the Khyber Pass which is blocked by snow in Winter. Thus, the defenders would easily be overwhelmed before reinforcements could arrive. It is, however, possible that an Afghan force will arrive over the pass after Peshawar is in our hands to recapture it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
july_ordinances_title;The July Ordinances;;;;;;;;;;;;;
july_ordinances_desc;Liberalism is a scourge upon the monarchy. It must be put down through a heavy-handed approach to ruling France's subjects, lest we fail to save the French people from their naive ideas of how they wish to be governed. Chief Minister Jules Armand de Polignac, an ultraroyalist who has long been targeted by the liberals, proposes a set of royal ordinances meant to reign France in: they include limitation of press freedom, a newly appointed set of reactionary Councillors of State, the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, and the exclusion of the middle class from future elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEIZUREOFLENATIONAL;In response to the July Ordinances' restrictions on press freedom, staff writers at the liberal newspaper Le National published a petition demanding restoration of their rights. Agents of the prince de Polignac then promptly raided the journal's offices. Le National originated as a liberal mouthpiece in light of de Polignac's rise to power, patronized by liberal officials such as the prince of Talleyrand and the duke of Broglie. The paper's existence proves a thorn in the state's backside. We maintain that the government acted fully in its authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JULYREVOLUTION;The Bourbon monarchy is no longer in France as of today. After the surge of reactionary behavior under Chief Minister de Polignac--who was narrowly re-elected after having been voted out in a motion of no confidence--the French people were ignited to relaunch a revolution in the spirit of the first. De Polignac foolishly attempted to singlehandedly alter France's constitution by passing the draconian July Ordinances, attempting to create a newly authoritarian monarchy. Rioting and looting has dragged on for three days, until the people finally captured the H tel de Ville in Paris and declared a provisional government, after wholly defeating the last of the royalists' forces. A new monarchy is expected to emerge with Louis Philippe of Orl ans, a former Republican general, as king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOUISPHILLIPETROLLS;France's new king has taken the throne: Louis Philippe of Orl ans. As duke of Chartres and a former general of the Revolutionary Wars, he served with distinction but later broke with the revolutionaries after they decided to kill King Louis XVI. He later exiled himself to Switzerland in 1793 after it was discovered he was conspiring to restore the monarchy. \n\nCharles X had named Louis Philippe his lieutenant general, though he not-so-secretly held ambitions to succeed Charles as king. Already popular among the masses, the Chamber of Deputies has appointed Louis Philippe I as the first in the Orl ans dynasty--hopefully marking a return to the center-right policies of Napoleon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

[...] However, Sire, in the midst of the unanimous feelings of respect and affection with which your people surround you, there is manifested in people's minds a deep anxiety which disturbs the security which France had begun to enjoy, alters the sources of its prosperity, and could, if it were prolonged, become disastrous to his rest.'\nPresident of parliament Royer-Collard opened its new session with an address to Charles X approved by a 221 deputies, the liberal majority. This address demands that Chief Minister Polignac resign and that future ministers pledge to act in accordance with the wishes of Parliament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JUNEREBELLION;Fighting has broken out between the National Guard and republican rebels, who have conspired to overthrow the July Monarchy. After the funeral of former army commander and anti-monarchist Jean Maximilien Lamarque, riots emerged as citizens sympathetic to his beliefs attempted to make their opinions against the government heard. Attacks against our forces were swift and well-organized, carried out by secret societies such as the infamous Society of the Rights of Men, whose members stockpile weapons as if building an army. Their fighters were reinforced by disaffected Parisien youth and refugees from Germany, Poland, and Italy, each of whom were being pursued by their respective governments for participating in republican activism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

VENDEEETCHOUANNERIE;Legitimist sentiment is rising in the departement of the Vend e, within Brittany. Legitimists pledge allegiance to the House of Orl ans as the rightful heir to the monarchy, and are willing to attack French forces to see the installment of an Orl ans dynasty through. Charles X, who was exiled to Scotland following the July Revolution, has given up on reclaiming the throne. It has thus been concluded that his daughter-in-law, Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Siciles, must be orchestrating the unrest, for she has been promoting her young son Henri's claim to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIESTARTS;The struggle against the Legitimist rebels in the Vend e has escalated to open combat. Troops must now rally to engage the rabble! Legitimist generals like Louis de Bourmont and Charles de Beaumont d'Autichamp who left France when king Louis Philippe took the throne have returned to spearhead the revolt. But however good its generals may be, the rebellion is comprised of the very conservative rural populace of the region who have little to no experience in combat. Additionally, the rebels lack guns and ammunition which they had hoped to get in the form of foreign support of which there is none forthcoming. \n RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event! W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEBOR;The Legitimist revolution is a success. France now has a new king: Henri of Orl ans, former Duke of Chambourd. Henri was not in the line of succession for the throne under the current Bourbon dynasty, though his mother, Marie-Caroline, Duchess of Berry, resented his exclusion. This is because Henri's birth to his two members of the Bourbon-Two Sicilies house created a perfect line of descendence from King Louis XVI, the first French Bourbon monarch. Thus, Marie-Caroline considers Henri the rightful king and herself regent. She collaborated with Legitimist militants to install her son--and the results now speak for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEFRA;The Duchess of Berry has been connected to the now-defeated Legitimist insurrection in the Vend e. Having resented her son Henri's not being in the line of succession on the French throne, she collaborated with militants to see Henri installed. Her resentment is driven by how Henri is directly descended from King Louis XVI, and also has a mother from his same royal house. Because of this, some legitimists see Henri as the rightful king, after the abdications of Charles X and Louis Antoine. \n\nThe Duchess was arrested today and will remain incarcerated for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

KAAHUMANU;Following the death of Kamehameha II during his visit to England, Queen Ka'ahumanu became the regent of Hawai i. The favorite wife of Kamehameha I, the founder of the kingdom, she wields a great amount of influence in the kingdom as she reigns over the minority of her stepson Kamehameha III. \nA devout Christian ever since her conversion in 1824, she has been notable for stamping out pagan practices in the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;

LONDONCONFERENCESTARTS;France, Russia and the UK have finished a conference in London to definitively delineate our borders and establish a permanent government. Their decision was to move our border a bit further North to the so-called Arta-Volos line and to install a Catholic Bavarian prince by the name of Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern. Another demand of the three guarantors is the final abolition of slavery in Greece. While this agreement would hand a significant amount of currently Ottoman land to us, having a German Catholic on our throne is almost unacceptable. However, if we refuse to abide by the conference's terms, our former guarantors may abandon us in the event of an Ottoman attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LONDONCONFENOGPSTUR;The Greek government has refused to abide by the terms of the London Conference in which France, Russia and the UK, the three guarantors of Greek independence, agreed on Greece's final borders and form of government.

President Juan Jos  Flores has called a assembly to draft our future constitution to proclaim the State of Ecuador. With this said, our intention is to eventually rejoin a future confederated Colombia as one of its constitutent countries.

NAPOLEONTHESECONDDIES;The fated heir to Nap leon I's empire passed away today of tuberculosis. \n\nBorn in 1811, Nap leon II had been named Prince Imperial per the French Empire's constitution and was proclaimed King of Rome by his overly proud father. He reigned over France for two weeks after his father's second abdication in 1815, aged only three. The backdrop of the Allies' capture of Paris made an anticlimactic end to his ascension--though he ruled from Austria the entire time while living with his mother. Later he was granted the title of Duke of Reichstadt and was appointed as a cadet in the Austrian army. His military career fascinated and caused apprehension among European leaders, who feared he may usurp the French throne later as an adult. Alas, this never came to be. He died in Vienna's Sch nbrunn Palace at 21.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMERICANANTISLAVERYSOCIETY;Slavery's continued existence in the United States continues to face challenges from outspoken critics. The American Anti-Slavery Society, formed by abolitionist journalist William Lloyd Garrison, has grown out of these outcries and vows to do all it can for the abolitionist cause. They are officially pacifist, but its members have signed a pact to show their willingness to become martyrs if necessary. \n\nThe abolitionists know slavery's status quo is slowly crumbling. With the Supreme Court already having proclaimed states cannot nullify federal laws, it is only a matter of time until an abolitionist Congress or president gains power and nationally outlaws slavery. The Anti-Slavery Society wishes in the meantime to appeal to Americans' morals to convince them of slavery's atrocity and sinfulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thirty-four chiefs drafted and signed the document, creating a "Confederation of United Tribes." They hope to solicit the British for protection against French claims to the island, while also doing away with extraterritoriality the British settlers on the island enjoy. \n\nThe Maori chiefs are thankful for the British crown's efforts to officialize their nationhood by desgining a national flag, allowing them to legally trade with ports in New South Wales and Norfolk Island. But they may be terribly naive as to how willing Britain is to respect the independence of a small island nation ripe for colonizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BATTLEOFONCATIVO;La Plata is in an on-off civil war, with armies fighting for control of the virtually non-existent federal government. The conflict's two factions, one supporting unitarianism and the other federalism, clashed today in a battle in Oncativo, C rdoba Province. The Unitarian forces of General Jos  Mar a Paz pushed back the Federalist troops led by Facundo Quiroga, showing potential weakness for the Federalist forces led by Buenos Aires. The Federalists had attempted a march toward the Platine interior through C rdoba. With this foiled, the Unitarians may push into the coast--unless Federalist provincial governors unite in a coalition against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARIANLEAGUE;The general Jos  Mar a Paz has declared the formation of the Unitarian League, or the League of the Interior, comprising all the western interior provinces of La Plata. These provinces' leaders vow to restore the unitarian form of government previously held under Bernardino Rivadavia, our first president. After our war with Brazil, the office of the president was declared in an attempt to consolidate La Plata's constantly feuding provinces, each trying to maintain autonomy under their respective caudillos. Rivadavia's authority was firmly rejected by the other provinces. Our country has been run as a weakly-bound confederacy since then. \n\nIf the League of the Interior succeeds, La Plata will be transformed: we will truly begin to think of ourselves as a nation. Nevertheless, they are a threat. Their belligerance challenges the caudillos' authority--and they will defend their lands to the death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEDERALPACT;In response to the Unitarian League's formation, the governors of Buenos Aires, Entre R os, and Santa F  have convened to sign the Federal Pact, pledging commitment to preserving the country's federalism. The pact was proposed by the Buenos Aires governor, Juan Manuel de Rosas, a de facto dictator who has enforced his will through a private militia to maintain supremacy over all the other provinces. \n\nEach of the Pact's members enjoys free trade with each other and a pledge of military protection from other provinces' invasions. It goes to show that La Plata's legal status is so far removed from its reality: it is a collection of virtually independent provinces at each others' throats. But if through federalism is how we are destined to survive, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARYLEAGUEWAR;Federalist General  ngel Pacheco has made his first move in an offensive against the Unitarians. His Buenos Aires division landed an ambush on Unitarian troops in the town of Fraile Muerto, in C rdoba province. His troops' tactical upper hand was further guaranteed by how the ambushed division, led by General Jos  Mar a Paz, contained many former Federalist troops who were captured by the Unitarians and forced to fight for their side. These troops then switched sides again and asisted Pacheco's army. Together they are marching through C rdoba, forcing a Unitarian retreat and spelling true peril for their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

occupy_falklands_desc;The Falkland Islands, or Las Islas Malvinas in Spanish, are a source of great territorial dispute. Having competed with both France and Spain for sovereignty over the islands, we are now left squabbling with the independent Argentine administration over whose countries rightfully deserves to control them. The Falklands' current Argentine governor, Luis Vernet, has ignored our diplomatic protests over the blocking of British fishing rights to the islands' coasts. With him in charge, the Falklands are sure to be consolidated under Argentine control, unless we use the military to retake them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MALVINASSONBRITANICAS;The British brig-sloop HMS Clio, commanded by Captain John James Onslow, docked in Puerto Soledad, Islas Malvinas, today to forcibly capture the islands. Upon arriving, he instructed Admiral Jos  Mar a Pinedo, leader of the Malvinas fleet, to surrender all his ships to Britain and allow the Union Jack to be hoisted on the port's docks. Pinedo contemplated resisting, though his forces' numerical disadvantage made it futile. \n\nThe loss of our territory again, even after our defeat of the Spanish, to European colonialism is an affront to the nation. If there is justice in this world, it will be avenged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Situated on a water channel called "Tarontho," between the Lakes Simcoe and Cachinching, and standing in the shadow of Lake Ontario, York makes for an ideal settlement and industrial hub. Thus, the colonial government has deemed it necessary today to incorporate York and its environs into a new city named after the Tarontho channel. The city of Toronto shall serve as a new metropolis, calling to the populace of all of Canada and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BLACKWAR;Ever since Europeans arrived on Australia, there has been conflict between the native Aboriginal peoples and the colonizers. The Black War, or the Tasmanian War as some call it, has plagued the island since 1803 when the first major settlements were established. The Aboriginal's skirmishes with the colonists more than doubled in intensity during the 1820s as a result of the settlers' continued attempts at killing the native people. Between 1826 and 1828 there were multiple major massacres resulting in the deaths of 408 Aboriginal Tasmanians and 61 British settlers. In 1830, lieutenant-governor George Arthur ordered 2,200 men, consisting of soldiers and free citizens, to persecute and forcibly relocate four out of the nine Aboriginal nations into a  reservation." The 31st of December 1831 officially marks the end of the Black War as the last resisting tribes whose numbers had dwindled to 28 people have surrendered after years of persecution and genocide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LEAGUEWAR;The Costa Rican government has repealed the so-called "Ambulance Law," the legal practice of rotating the country's capital between four cities. Authorities have squabbled over what should be the Costa Rican capital ever since its independence from Spain, but traditionally its provincial capital under Spanish rule had been the city of Cartago. After independence, however, the capital switched to San Jos , to some protest that prompted the federal government to create four equal-status capitals. This changed when the current head of state, Braulio Carrillo Colina, repealed the Ambulance Law, cementing San Jos  as the sole Costa Rican capital. Paramilitaries of the four other former capitals--Cartago, Alajuela, and Heredia--have mobilized to force the law's re-enactment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TITHEWAR;Tithe payments are a tax imposed on farmers in Ireland. They pay 10 percent of the value of their agricultural produce to the clergy for the sake of financing the church. This has been a rather unpopular tax within the Catholic Irish communities, resulting in multiple clashes and protests. The "war" took a turn in 1831 when the Irish Constabulary fired on people resisting payments, killing 12 and wounding another 20. This event led anti-tithe protestors to ambush 40 Constabularies, killing 12, including the Chief Constabulary. Today, 200,000 people have gathered in Ballyhale in support of those being charged for the events that resulted in the 1831 killings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is a cancer that devours its morality.' He will always be remembered for having ousted the tyrannical Dom Miguel I and having brought constitutionalism to Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LAGRANJA;Inspired by the 1830 French Revolution, exiled Spanish liberals have organized many unsuccessful military coups--known as pronunciamentos in Spanish--to re-establish the 1812 Constitution and end Fernando VII's absolute monarchy. The most notable of these was the pronunciamento of general Jos  Torrijos, who ended up shot. The latest to occur was today, in the palace of La Granja, where King Fernando resides. On the 16th, Ferdinand's health took a turn for the worse, and he was expected to die at any moment. His wife, Mar a Cristina, was then betrayed by the top brass in the army, who refused to acknowledge her regency. Thus, she influenced her husband to revoke the Pragmatic Sanction, preventing Carlos Isidro from ascending the throne. On the 18th, Fernando's father, Carlos IV, as regent annulled the Salic law of succession in the Spanish monarchy, attempting to make the royal line patrilineal. But today, unexpectedly, Ferdinand VII has recovered his health, dismissed ministers supporting Carlos's ascension, and repealed his father's decree, making Isabel the heir to the throne again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TORRIJOSPRONOUNCEMENT;Liberals launched another pronunciamento today in M laga, though it failed after its organizers fell into a trap set by our navy and the captain general of Andalusia. In May, the insurgent general Jos  Mar a Torrijos presented his plan for this insurrection, consisting of a "circumferential" penetration of the country to attack the center, Madrid, from various points. They would pick up liberal sympathizers along the way to encircle the capital, hoping their numbers would suffice to overwhelm the Spanish army. But first, they were to cross into Spanish territory from Gibraltar, with Torrijos leading them, to signal the uprising s start. M laga s governor confided anonymously to Torrijos in September that the best place for the landing would be the coast of M laga, where he would be assured of the support of local garrisons. On November 30th, two boats with sixty men headed by Torrijos left Gibraltar. They found their destination after forty hours of travel however, they were met with gunfire from the docked Spanish ship Neptune, and the conspirators have now all been executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Catalonia, Aragon, Vasconia and Valencia run red with blood, and their populations, blinded by Carlism, are fighting for them. The Carlist uprisings are fueled by Fernando VII's death and the enactment of the Pragmatic Sanction, a liberal law to allow Isabel II to be the heir to the throne. For Isabel to take the throne instead of the megalomaniacal Carlos would mean a new era of prosperity for the nation. Viva Isabel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PRAGMATICSANCTION1830;Today, the Spanish government has published the contents of the 1789 Pragmatic Sanction, passed in that year unanimously by the court, which reinstates the traditional system of succession and abandons that which Felipe V introduced in 1713. From the year of its passing until now, the Sanction never would be revealed to the public and, therefore, had no legal validity. After the death of his third wife, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, King Fernando VII announced in September 1829 that he would marry again. He chose the Neapolitan princess Mar a Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies as his bride, despite her being his niece and twenty-two years his younger. They married on December 10th that year. A few months later Fernando would declare the Pragmatic Sanction of 1789 fully in effect, ensuring that his eldest child even if they were a girl would succeed him. The decree has produced discontent among those would desire Carlos Mar a Isidro, Fernando s brother, to succeed to the throne thus creating the Carlist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTICLERICALRIOTS1835;A series of riots against the clergy, inspired by the massacre of friars in Madrid produced a year ago, have begun to sow chaos in Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia. The violence is motivated by the clergy's support for Carlism and its work to suppress liberalism. By order of Valencia s captain general, the archbishop of Barcelona left the country with a military escort and took refuge in Bordeaux, France. He escaped before being able to see the violence reach new heights of bloodshed, with no end in sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Indeed, his parents were cousins, his first marriage was to a cousin and his second and fourth marriages to nieces. Finally, in 1830, Isabel II was born and designated as his heir by the Pragmatic Sanction. However, as his brother, Carlos Mar a Isidro de Borb n, has refused to accept Isabel II's legitimacy, his death has left a succession crisis behind with one of the factions, the Carlists, already beginning to show signs of an impending rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In response, Emperor Minh Mang has declared that the Cham king, Po Phaok The, ought to be arrested, and that Champa must be incorporated into the Vietnamese Empire for the king's treasonous behavior. Vietnamese troops are mobilizing for an invasion of our kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHATOWARCHA;The region of Champa, in central and southern Vietnam, was reduced to the principalities of Panduranga and Kauthara on the eve of the 16th century. We annexed Kauthara halfway through the 17th century, and by now, Panduranga has lost its hereditary monarchy status, with kings being appointed by our court in Hue. Emperor Minh Mang has accused the king of Panduranga, Po Phaok The, of supporting the faction of Le Van Duyet, a rival of our empire. Thus, Minh Mang has made a declaration that the king of Champa must be toppled, and that the Champan people should be incorporated into our empire. Cham troops are mobilizing for the defense of their kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KATIPSUMAT;Recently, rumors have been brought to light that the Cham Muslim leader Katip Sumat has spent the early months of 1833 gathering his followers in a remote base in the countryside. Demanding from his followers "absolute loyalty to Allah and Islam," he had been preaching the Qur an and disseminating Islamism, defending the establishment of an Islamist Vietnam and a jihad against the Nguyen dynasty. With their flags raised, and the words Po Rasak written upon them   meaning His Great Glorious Wonderful   a clear implication for either Allah or the prophet Muhammad, the rebels have just launched attacks against Vietnamese tax register centers and military garrisons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JATHAKWA;Following our suppression of Katip Sumat s Islamist uprising in the summer of last year, the Cham people are once again acting against our rule, and it appears that they are being supported by the Montagnards. Attacking our provinces from Binh Tuan to Phu Yuen, reports reveal that Ja Thak Wa, a Cham Muslim cleric, is the leader of this revolt. It seems that his main interest is in proclaiming a new Champa dynasty, as he has announced that Po War Palei, the son-in-law of the last deputy ruler of the Champa, as the new King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHAMGENOCIDE;Minh Mang, Emperor of Vietnam, had dispatched over 3,000 troops to deal with the Cham rebels since the beginning of the uprisings in the region. The monarch had promised good remittances for soldiers who killed and beheaded rebels, and a wave of massacres and systematic killings took the Cham people by a storm. Slow slicing and rampant mass killings allowed the fury of Vietnamese troops to turn into a de facto ethnocide in Champa, with competitions between the Vietnamese royal troops and Kinh paramilitary units. By the summer of 1835, the Champa king, Po War Lei, was killed in action, and Ja Thak Wa was captured by Vietnamese troops and sentenced to death. Seven to twelve Cham villages were scrambled to the ground, and the murders and exile of other revolutionaries such as Po Phoak The, and the demolition of Cham temples, cemeteries and villages, signals the end of large-scale Cham revolts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GEORGEIVDED;His Majesty, George IV of the United Kingdom, has passed away today, in 1830. Born in 1762, crowned King in 1820, and dead in 1830, George was known for his absurd eating habits, his vast consumption of alcohol and his usage of laudanum to ease chronic pains. Weighing 280 pounds at his passing, George had arteriosclerosis, gout and suffered, like his father, from cataracts. The Scottish artist David Wilkie had remarked that the monarch looked like  a great sausage stuffed into the covering  due to his immense size. Having a rule marked by scandal due to his mistresses, his financial extravagance and a  selfish, unreliable and irresponsive  personality, George gradually grew ill due to his awful habits, with intensifying coughs at the time of his death. Clutching his stomach, the King died from an upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from the rupture of a blood vessel in his stomach. According to some versions, George s last words were:  my boy [to his page], this is death .;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOUISIDED;Grand Duke Ludwig I of Baden has died at the age of 67, leaving the succession of his titles in the hands of his half-brother, Leopold. His life accomplishments during his reign include securing the continued existence of the University of Freiburg, and founding the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe which will go on to become the oldest technical school in Germany. Ludwig s death means the extinction of his line in the Baden family. There has been much gossiping and rumor-fabrication surrounding his death, some saying that a mysterious 17 year old man named Kaspar Hauser who appeared in 1828 is the illegitimate son of Ludwig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LUDWIGHESSEDED;The Grand Duke Ludwig I of Hessen-Darmstadt has passed away at the age of 76. Succeeding his father, Ludwig IX, Ludwig I was elevated to Grand Duke of Hesse in 1806, due to allying Napoleon I, and joined the Confederation of the Rhine. During the Congress of Vienna, Ludwig would lose his Westphalian territories, but was compensated with the district of Rheinhessen. Because of this acquired territory, he changed his title to Grand Duke of Hesse by the Rhine. He is succeeded by his eldest son, Ludwig II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
baden_tithe_abolition_title;The Abolition of the Tithes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
baden_tithe_abolition_desc;The practice of tithing, or the mandated payment in-kind of peasants' production to their landlord as part of their feudal obligations, has for over a decade been under scrutiny by our government: In addition to hindering efforts to modernize agricultural practices, transporting and storing tithe goods incurs a significant logistical burden and results in significant wastage of agricultural output. The Baden Estates have come to a resolution to finally begin the abolition of this ancient practice, allowing for estates to forgo tithing in exchange for a compensatory pension equivalent to twenty times a tithe's appraised annual value, with twenty percent of this pension being supplied by a state tithe replacement fund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
brunswick_constitution_1832_title;The Brunswickian Constitution of 1832;;;;;;;;;;;;;
brunswick_constitution_1832_desc;After the revolution of 1830, liberal reforms and a new constitution have been proposed by members of the Upper House. This constitution would allow voting, but limited by a census suffrage system, which ensures about 40% of Brunswick s male population is allowed to vote. The parliament would also be granted more rights than in most other German states while limiting the Duke s power and monetary budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYECHARLESBRUNSWICK;While Charles II of Brunswick technically reigned for 15 years, over half of it was through the prince-regent of Great Britain and Hanover. Charles was set to take the throne at the age of 19. However, when he turned 18, Hanover rushed through constitutional reforms that limited his powers, redefined his duchy, hereditary lands and due income. Charles ended his regency early, declaring in an edict that Hanover was a usurper and that the new constitution imposed by it was invalid because it limited his powers and went against all international norms of law, causing outrage in Hanover and England. The German Confederation attempted to intervene in the matter and ordered Charles to accept the new constitution, which he promptly disregarded, keeping Brunswick an absolute monarchy. This year, however, amidst the July Revolution, Charles' absolutism has been getting less popular in Brunswick, culminating in a large mob breaking into the palace to overthrow him, placing his brother William as Duke in his stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTTINGERREV;Liberal citizens of G ttingen started an armed uprising on the 8th of January with the goal of abolishing the feudal governing system. The uprising was quenched on the 16th of January, while the general state of the rest of Hanover remained calm. The reason for the uproar in G ttingen looks to be related to a widespread hatred for a specific book, written by Friedrich Wilhelm Boldewin von dem Knesebeck in praise of the nobility as a preserver of stability. Friedrich implied that stronger surveillance against liberal advocates was necessary, which seems to have been the cause of the recent troubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAX1830REV;1827 marked the death of King Friedrich August I, who was succeeded by King Anton. Anton has so far failed to enact any reforms throughout his 3 years of rule, but this has primarily been blamed on the cabinet minister Detlev von Einsiedel who remains the politically dominant figure within the Kingdom. In June, many of our subjects started outspokenly criticizing the current regime's lack of liberal reforms, primarily in Leipzig where the 300th anniversary of the Confessio Augustana of 1530 was being celebrated. Many felt the ban on wearing student uniforms- a symbol of liberalism- was a form of harassment, and have taken to the streets in protest. Local authorities dispatched police, which increased liberal resistance even further. After the July Revolution in France, protests have started to become more common, with the Leipzig protest repeating in September. From Leipzig, unrest has more recently begun spreading to other cities, such as Dresden. King Anton has now convened a security commission, seeking to deal with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_saxonia_title;The Saxon Constitution of 1831;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_saxonia_desc;A new constitution has been proposed by King Anton and Prince co-regent Frederick Augustus II, which would transform the Kingdom of Saxony into a parliamentary monarchy. The king would be head of the government, but could not become ruler of another state (save by blood inheritance) without consent of the Diet or parliament. The king's decrees have to be countersigned by at least one of his ministers, and without it, none of the king's acts could be considered valid. The king would have supreme power over religious matters, and could overrule any judgement delivered in court of law. The king has the power to promote laws, and without his consent no proposals for laws may be passed in the Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

champa_jihad_desc;The Cham people have proven themselves resilient, with dedication to Allah and characteristic determination, against the imperial ambitions of Vietnam. Now Katip Sumat, an Islamist leader and preacher who demands absolute loyalty to Allah and Islam, calls for jihad against the barbarians to the north. Tired of the tyranny of the Vietnamese, our soldiers have voluntarily been waving black banners and calling for war. If Po Phaok The, King of the Cham, accepts the call for holy warfare against the northern invaders, the house of Islam will be expanded, and peace will be guaranteed for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INVASIONOFSYRIA;The ambitious Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt has long been plotting to invade our Syrian provinces. In the revolt of the Greeks against our rule, we enlisted his help in crushing them in return for the promise of giving Egypt sovereignty over Crete, Cyprus and Morea. However, as the joint Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet intervened in the Battle of Navarino and sank the Egyptian navy, leading to our defeat in the war. Now, the scheming Muhammad Ali has declared war on us, using their lack of compensation for intervening in Greece as a casus belli, as he never received Crete, Cyprus or Morea. With his recent reforms of administration and army organization, his forces pose a legitimate threat to the levant. We must rally our forces and crush Egypt once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CENTRALITALYORDER;The Italian United Provinces have been thoroughly crushed. Outmatched on the battlefield, the irregular Italian militia were easily defeated. Habsburg forces have retaken the key revolutionary cities and re-established the status quo antebellum, ending the dream of a united Italy -- for now.

UCALIBERALSTHIRTYFIVE;Jos  Gregorio Salazar y Castro, a conservative, won the election of 1834 and became supreme leader of the Federal Republic of Central America. However, the El Salvador-based liberals have been becoming ever more influential in the federation's legislative assembly. They have now used their power to declare the election results null with bogous claims of electoral fraud. Gregorio has sullenly agreed to hand over supreme command to Francisco Moraz n, head of the liberals. The new government has even relocated the capital from Guatemala to El Salvador, solidifying its new seat of power. While the liberals are celebrating their successful takeover, the conservatives are plotting their revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAVOIEINVASION;Several Mazzinian exiles have attempted to overthrow King Vittorio Emmanuele I. They accused the Sovereign of consolidating central power for himself, giving life to an absolutism that would not have admitted opposition. The revolt involved an invasion of Savoy from the French border and direct action from infamous Italian republican Giuseppe Garibaldi, who would organize a revolt within the Kingdom s fleet and meet them up with the invaders. \n\nBut the Piedmontese troops expected an invasion for some time, thanks to some information reports received beyond the border. In fact, leading insurgent general Girolamo Ramorino immediately realized the impossibility of the success of the plan, both the invasion of Savoy and Garibaldi's  mutiny. The rebellion s failure led to some of its organizers, such as Ramorino and fellow general Giovanni Battista Scapaccino, to renounce their republican ideals and defect again to the monarchy. Garibaldi, meanwhile, has gone back into hiding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_title;The Kurhessische Verfassung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_desc;A new constitution modeled to some extent after that of England, has been supported by the Elector. This new constitution would establish a popular representation in a Diet or Congress of the provinces, and would extend liberty of speech and that of the press. The constitution would also seek to separate royal and state revenues, and make ministers swear an oath to the constitution, as well as implementing an impeachment system for ministers who break their oath. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_title;The Staatgrundgesetz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_desc;The Staatsgrundgesetz, a constitution proposed by the estates and supported by cabinet minister Caspar Detlev von Schulte would liberalize our monarchy to appease the left and prevent a repetition of the events of 1830. It would combine the Generalsteuerkasse with the K nigliche Generalkasse to a singular Steuerkasse and give the power to set our country's budget to the estates. The city of Hannover's magistrates that the government currently appoints would be made independent with a simple government veto right to their appointment, giving the city more autonomy. More importantly, it would open the upper house of the estates to farmers and the middle class. While staunch conservatives oppose this constitution, it is clearly necessary to maintain the stability of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAPODISTRASDED;Ex-foreign minister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia - and first governor of Greece - Ioannis Kapodistrias, has just been murdered on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplion. His assassination was carried out by the disgruntled brother and son of one Petrobey Mavromichalis (a popular and successful leader in the uprising against Ottoman rule), whose imprisonment had been ordered by Kapodistrias. Konstantinos- Ioannis  brother, and Ioannis  son Georgios waited on the steps of the church, and killed Kapodistrias by stabbing him in the chest, and consecutively shooting him in the head. After the deed, Konstantis was shot by general Fotomaris, who witnessed the murder from his window. Georgios, however, had slipped away from the scene and would only surrender to authorities days later. He was subsequently put to death by firing squad, his last words being:  Peace Brothers! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

althorpact_desc;The Factory Act, or Althorp s Act, would seek to establish a regular working day, specifically for children in the workforce. Children through the ages 9-12 are limited to 48 hours of work per week, children under the age of 9 would not be allowed in factories (apart from silk mills), children under the age of 18 are not allowed to work at night, children through the ages 9-13 must not work more than 8 hours a day with an hour lunchbreak, children through the ages 14-18 must not work more than 12 hours with an hour lunchbreak. The Act would also establish a Factory Inspectorate, and allow for routine factory inspections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALAWITEREV;While having been relatively content with autonomous rule in the mountains of Latakia, the Alawis within our borders have started organizing an uprising at a scale we have yet to see. The cause of the recent unrest is partly due to the call for mass mobilization by Muhammad Ali, which upset the Alawites who remain loyal to the Ottomans. During a march of Egyptian soldiers from Aleppo to Latakia some 4,000 Alawi militants attacked the column, forcing the Egyptians to retreat to Latakia. The Alawite forces pursued, and laid siege to Latakia, causing much damage and monetary loss. We need to act now to return order to our rebellious provinces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PEASANTSPALESTINEREVOLT;Egypt's war effort against the Ottomans has led to extreme unrest in Palestine. To gather an army capable of marching to Constantinople, Ibrahim Pasha has ordered a fifth of all Muslims under Egyptian rule to be conscripted, including those in the now-conquered Levant. With this extensive draft has come high taxes that are draining the income of Levantine Arab peasants. These peasants, not owning land of their own, receive housing on the farms they tend to by their landlord and are meanwhile paid a subsistence wage that cannot survive high taxing.\n\nWith these factors contributing to huge unrest, the Palestinian sheikh Qasim al-Ahmad has ordered his followers to disobey the Egyptian draft orders and refuse to pay these taxes. Peasants and nobles alike have declared an open revolt, storming cities such as Hebron, Nablus, and Safed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPANISHCHOLERA;It's been nine months since cholera hit France, and our authorities knew it was only a matter of time before it came to Spain as well. Over the past month, cholera was reported in Vigo, Galicia, which now hosts the majority of cases in all the country. The outbreak initially was caused by the landing of auxiliary troops in Portugal, where the War of Portuguese Succession still rages on. Almost instantly another outbreak emerged in Barcelona. But cases are spreading most widely in the south, where thousands of deaths have occurred. The plague is bringing winds of rebellion to the population, who resent the government's poor response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ODAALAPATRIA;A poem in Catalan entitled 'La P tria,' or 'The Homeland' in English, by Carles Aribau, has been published recently.

It tells of the longing for an independent Catalonia and exalts the Catalan language--a clear threat to the unity of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANKFURTERWACHENSTURM;There is a spectre haunting Germany--that of liberalism--and its effects are becoming more and more visible. Today, fifty students stormed Frankfurt's Hauptwache and Konstablerwache police offices, attempting to gain access to the German Confederacy's treasury. This, in turn, would enable them to hold the Confederacy's leadership hostage and force the German states' unification. The police summarily apprehended the perpetrators. Eight of them, however, escaped to the United States. \n\nIt remains to be seen how much more influence these revolutionaries' circles will gain in Germany. One of the groups participating in the attack, the Burschenschaft, will not rest until Germany becomes a single political entity for the first time in over a millennium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The previously-elected governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Ram n Balcarce, has been been deposed and replaced with Juan Jos  Viamonte, a crony of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Balcarce provoked the anger of the Rosas-supporting federalists after announcing that Rosas would be tried for treason, having seized absolute power during his governance from 1829 to 1832. Thus, a contingent of federalists immediately headed for Buenos Aires from Rosas' military campaign in the Pampas and threatened to forcibly oust Balcarce. Rosas' wife, Encarnaci n Ezcurra, worked behind the scenes to ensure further military support for the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

carlist_distributism_title;Carlist Distributism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
carlist_distributism_desc;Upon the advent of socialism, the Catholic church felt compelled to make a response to the unrest the socialist movement created amongst the poor strata of society, as the Church historically held a highly conservative standpoint and felt that socialist and liberal political activism threatened to upend traditional moral and moral structures, as well as erode Catholic church authority, which had already been declining for some time. The Papal response therefore was to seek the advent of a 'third way' ideology, one that would come to be known as distributism. Characterized by clerical authority, land reform, agrarianism, and extensive preference to small business enterprise over corporations, the ideology would quickly gain traction as the primary economic policy of the Carlist movement. Passing this reform will therefore greatly strengthen resource output and education at the expense of heavy industrial efficieny, and the redistribution of land will undoubtedly come at great cost to the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

constitution_of_1888_desc;Since the succession of Carlos V to the throne of Spain, the issue of a Spanish constitution has been put on hold, due to the deeply traditionalist mindset of the Carlist support base, and fears that caving to liberal ideals would erode the authority of the church and of the Fueros system. With a more liberally-minded monarch in charge, perhaps a middle ground can be met, with the creation of a proper national legislature. The result is the Turnismo system, wherein the legislature is organized under a bicameral system between traditionalists and liberals, members of which are carefully selected before elections begin, and are purposefully rotated in order to ensure neither party maintains absolute control over the Spanish government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

integrate_naples_desc;In the aftermath of the Spanish War of Succession, the crown of Naples was awarded in the peace deal to the Hapsburg monarchy. A valuable part of the realm, the Hapsburgs ruled over it over the course of the early 1700s, until losing it in the 1730s to the Bourbon dukes of Parma. With Italy placed under Austrian supervision, this unjust loss can finally be reversed, and Naples restored to its rightful place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00001;The Maroto Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00001;Rafael Maroto was a well-renowned Spanish General in the American Wars of Independence, and a distinct royalist in his loyalties, pledging himself to Don Carlos after resigning from formal military command in 1833 and being subsequently imprisoned by the liberal government for six months. In following years he proved to be a loyal commander, albeit one that remained at great odds with the conduct of Carlist forces, leading to a number of defeats due to infighting and court intrigue. A decree was issued to Don Carlos, proclaiming him a traitor and responsible for the deaths of several high ranking officials in early conflicts with the Liberals. Only a short time later, with the complete noncompliance of the Carlist armed forces surrounding Maroto, and a confrontation between his supporters and Don Carlos, was this decree ultimately reneged. Maroto was later credited as saying 'I have triumphed over the arbitrariness, injustice, and blindness of a prince, and history will judge me in due course.' This has proven to be a substantial humiliation to the Royalist cause in Spain, and a key event in the formation of the Marotist party within its ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00004;Juan III of Montizon, rightful king of Spain and France, has died on this day.

EVTNAME00005;The Death of Carlos of Madrid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00005;Carlos VII, Duke of Madrid and King of Spain, has died on this day. His procession is one of controversy, seen to some as a return to proper conservatism and a reaffirming of the Fueros and their privilege, and to others as a categorical failure, and a return to the reactionary politics so indicative of the Carlist cause. Nonetheless, he shall be followed by Jaime, who inherits both the duchy of Madrid and the kingdom of Spain, to be titled Jaime III.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00007;The Portuguese Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00007;Miguel I, rightful king of Portugal and longtime supporter of the Carlist cause in Spain, has been ousted from his seat of power in Portugal, leaving a liberal government to take power in his stead. This proves to be an existential threat to the cause of Carlos V, as the now-liberal Portuguese government may well prove to be a threat to the legitimacy of his own throne. Miguel has come to the Spanish for aid, and to support him could well be to bring about a valuable alliance with the other major Iberian state, perhaps even to restore the personal union of times' past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00007;We shall restore order to Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00008;The Restoration of Miguel I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00008;Miguel, the absolutist king of Portugal, has been returned to the throne he usurped from the prior royal family, and the throne he was forced to abdicate upon the success of the liberal revolts only a short while ago. At the behest of Carlos V, he proceeds to the throne of Portugal once again, and Spain is now at its liberty to decide how to restructure the Portuguese government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00009;The Second Coronation of Miguel I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00009;Miguel I, the tyrant usurper king of Portugal, has been restored to his stolen throne at the head of Portugal. Fears of Spanish reprisals have proven, thankfully, to be largely unfounded. This does not prevent or protect the people from his own reprisals, however. His reign remains unpopular, and shaken greatly by this incident, but hope remains that one day Portugal can return to some semblance of its prior stability and standing on the world stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00009;Short may his reign be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00010;The Quiet Ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00010;Miguel I, reactionary tyrant king of Portugal, has been returned to his throne. The ceremony was documented as being nearly entirely silent, even his present supporters being solemn in the knowledge of what Portugal lost in the face of this. Spain has seized control over the colonial holdings of the former Portuguese empire, and while the independence of Portugal itself remains intact, this remains the death-knell of its relevance on the world stage. Little hope remains for Portugal to regain its prior status, but perhaps it can claim its place in the sun in some other manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00010;The sun has set by his folly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00011;The Duchy of Portugal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00011;Miguel I, king of Portugal, has been returned to his country by force of Spanish arms. He has not ascended as king, this time, but has been deposed by not only liberals, but by Carlos V of Spain himself. The Kingdom of Portugal has been dissolved in its entirety, and its colonies seized by the greedy Spanish crown. In the place of the king now lies a lowly Duke, appointed by the Spanish monarch at his whim, and wholly subservient to the interests of the foreign crown. Miguel has returned in shame, and it is unlikely Portugal shall ever recover from this devastation. Miguel returns as the last king, and as the first Duke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00011;A king no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00012;The July Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00012;In the aftermath of the July Revolution, the French Bourbons have seemingly found themselves a haven in the reactionary state of the Kingdom of Spain, led by the deeply traditionalist king Carlos V. This friendly regime directly across the border has proven to be problematic to the legitimacy of the Orleanist monarchial line and its more liberal support base by potentially granting Legitimistes a base of operations directly across the border from France. This has become an embarrassment for the crown and for the revolution, and something must be done about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00012;We must demand their expatriation elsewhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00012;They are no threat to us there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00013;The July Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00013;In the aftermath of the July Revolution in France, the deposed rightful royal king of France, and his supporters, have found Spain to be a safe haven from the ravenous liberals across the border. Now, the Orleaniste usurpers in Paris have demanded that the French Bourbons, relative to our own king and nobility, be expatriated elsewhere just so they may have more security. While this demand is outrageous at the face of it, it has been strongly implied that France may consider force of arms if we do not oblige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00013;We will not violate our sovereignty for liberal prattle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00013;We shall concede to their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00014;The July Affair - Spain remains defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00014;The crown in Spain has refused our generous demands, and has reaffirmed that it is well within its territorial sovereignty to keep the Bourbon monarchs within their borders, despite our protest. We have little recourse in this matter, save force of arms, or dropping the matter entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00014;Are the Bourbons worth that much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00014;They will be expatriated, one way or another.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00015;The July Affair - Spain has Conceded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00015;The crown in Spain has made a wise choice and backed down on this matter. Political security has been secured, and the French Bourbons have been forced to move elsewhere, hopefully somewhere further away from the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00015;I wonder if we can make them expatriate their own Bourbons too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00016;The Fueros Debate - Carlos of Molina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00016;The issue of the Fueros is one of great contention amongst the peoples of the Kingdom of Spain, and the root of the divide between the Carlists and the Christinos. While the Christinos sought the devolution and assimilation of the fueros into the Spanish crown, the root of the Carlist movement seeks to protect the regional legal systems and minority rights indicative of the fueros system. With the success of Carlos V in asserting his claim to the Spanish throne, the issue of the Fueros has been put aside, for now, and the fueros will maintain their autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00016;Their autonomy is secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00017;The Fueros Debate - Carlos of Montemolin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00017;With the ascension of a new monarch to the Spanish throne comes a renewal of the fueros debate in the Spanish nation. A traditionalist at heart, much like his predecessor, he seeks to elevate the fueros and bring them to par with the rest of the Spanish country. To accomplish this, a legal reform program has been pushed forwards by the crown to achieve this end. It has proven more than popular amongst the catalan and basque peoples, but has itself become a controversy in the Castilian portion of the kingdom. The reform package seeks to modernize and codify the fueros further in Spanish law, trimming their long list of priveleges of unnecessary and archaic legal structures, while solidifying their status and rendering them all but immutable in the Spanish crown. As such, this reform will greatly increase the militancy of liberals across the kingdom who seek the abolishment of the fueros outright, while rendering the fueros themselves more efficient in their governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00017;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00017;There is no need to reform them now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00018;The Fueros Debate - Carlos of Montemolin's Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00018;With the first stage of the reform package set through, the king's full ambition with his reforms is becoming apparent - a total reform of the monarchial structure of Spain, to integrate the fueros as an established legal structure throughout the Spanish nation, and to codify their existence as integral to that of Spain. To accomplish this, each Fuero will be reorganized into separate crownlands, held as a personal demesne of the king, but being fully integrated under the crown of Spain. This places the Basque, Catalan, and Galician regions under direct rule from the king, and governed by Carlist supporters, irrespective of where the legislative apparatus in Madrid leans politically. In turn, trade restrictions and customs borders will be devolved between the crownlands and the rest of the country, whereas the rights of Catalan and Basque to organize in their own separate military units and govern their own territory will remain intact indefinitely. In effect,  This new reform package sees a potential solution to the Fueros debate altogether, but will undoubtedly further anger the liberals of the country-perhaps to the point of open revolution, and even among some Carlists is held as an overly ambitious reform scheme, and one that perhaps even lends a great deal of undue power to the monarch. (Will result in a tag revolt);;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00018;To hell with the opposition- pass it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00018;No more of this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00019;Assassination attempt on Carlos VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00019;It has been no secret that Carlos VI's reforms have been of immense controversy in the past few weeks, particularly among the people centering around Madrid, many of whom have flocked to the liberal Christino banners in reaction to what they perceive as a betrayal of Spanish interests in the interest of minorities that they see as rightfully subservient. This unrest has hit a recent high pitch with an attempted assassination of the king as he was on a street parade in Madrid. A gunman attempted to fire upon him, only narrowly missing before police dispatched and disarmed the man. It appears that even within the heartland of Spain, the king does not remain safe. This does not bode well for if the reforms are expanded upon, as he plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00019;The fires of revolution are stoked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00020;The Flames of Liberalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00020;Carlos VI has been nothing short of controversial since before he ever ascended the throne, as could be said for any Spanish monarchs in this time. While conservatives and traditionalists find the Carlist cause to be a banner to flock to, a realm of continued stability in the face of the tumultuous reform and change of the French and Portuguese, and a beacon for restored Spanish prestige in a modern age, the liberals see it as a counterrevolutionary reaction, an outdated regime of a bygone era. With the passage of the reform package championed by the king, this has exploded into open revolt across the Castilian countryside in reaction. While the unpopularity of these measures was already known, it has quickly become apparent that the reaction is far more dangerous than anticipated, especially as the calls of these locals have turned from not just declarations against the Carlists, but to declarations against the Spanish monarchy altogether. With the fires of this revolution stoked, it seems likely that a revolution has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00020;The banners of war beckon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00021;Carlos VI Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00021;Carlos VI has emerged triumphant in the face of the liberal opposition to his reforms, and yes, to his rule. His power greatly expanded in the face of the Liberal defeat, he has been granted full power to enact his rule over all of Spain, and indeed, to not only expand his reforms to the whole of the country, but to undo what reforms the Liberals had until that point forced onto the government. His power made absolute, Carlos has found bearing to solidify his reign in a manner more comprehensive than even the Ancien Regime, a truly modern monarchy led benevolently by his rule, at least in the minds of some. Liberals chafe under his rule, but it will be unlikely that they will pose a significant threat again in this lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00021;The Kingdom of Spain stands strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00022;The Liberal Revolution Triumphs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00022;In the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, the Carlist usurpers have been driven from the throne of Spain, and in their place a liberal republic has been proclaimed, ready to bring about a restoration of liberty to the Iberian peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00022;The Republic has been victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00023;The Fueros Debate - Juan III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00023;With the ascension of Juan III to the Spanish throne, the Fueros debate has regrettably taken up public discourse once again. As Carlos VI failed to bring any lasting change to the Fueros situation, the debate now falls into the hands of the current king to push forwards his vision for what shall be done. Unlike prior Carlist claimants, however, his views have controversially followed along with those of the Christinos in many regards, and as such he views the Fueros as a wholly outdated relic of a feudal past, not worth reforming, but rather total abolishment. To reach these ends, he is pushing forwards a reform program to increase the efficiency of the Fueros, substantially limiting their autonomy and reducing their legal protections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00023;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00023;No need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00024;The Fueros Debate - Juan III Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00024;With the initial passing of Juan III's reforms, it has quickly become clear that his actions have awoken a vehement response from the Basque and Catalan minorities of the kingdom. The threatening of their long-held privelegia is widely viewed as a direct violation of their cultural identities, and evidence of unrightful Castilian oppression of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula. To continue with these reforms will no doubt result in a falling-out with the Basque and Catalan minorities altogether, opening a rift that may well never close again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00024;Their opposition means little. Abolish the Fueros.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00024;Enough with this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00025;Basque riot in Barcelona!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00025;With the recent reform package passed by Juan III, in preparation to completely abolish the fueros, a riot has broken out in the city of Barcelona in response to this perceived betrayal by the Spanish monarchy that has sworn to uphold the rights and interests of the fueros since its onset, and has now begun reducing the rights of these communities in a matter irrespective of this pledge. The riot bodes ill for the fate of relations between the Spanish and the Basque, should the reforms continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00025;Cant they just Basque in the glory of Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00026;The Rise of Catalan and Basque Nationalism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00026;With the abolishing of the fueros, the protections for the minorities of Spain have been abolished by the central government, placing them fully under the authority of Madrid's wishes, irrespective of what these groups desire for themselves. In response, the idea of nationhood has arisen among these populations, who now see Spain as an oppressive foreign entity, and not representative of their national identities, which are now viewed as fundamentally separate from that of Spain itself. It is doubtful that this rift can ever be closed again in this current era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00026;So it will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00027;The Fueros Debate - Carlos VII;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00027;On the ascension of Carlos VII, the fueros debate has come up once again, and quite possibly for the last time in this era of history. By this point the Fueros have become, even in Victorian standards, highly established in society at large. Carlos VII is a Carlist in the most traditional sense, viewing the Fueros as an integral part of Spanish society, and indeed, not well-respected enough. As such, he seeks to not only preserve, but expand the privelegia of the fueros into full-scale autonomy and confederalism, devolving Spanish control into a mere rubber stamp for their own, largely independent actions. To accomplish this, the king has pressed forwards a reform program to steadily begin increasing their autonomy in local affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00027;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00027;MORE autonomy? No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00028;The Fueros Debate - Carlos VII Solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00028;With the increased autonomy granted to the fueros by the first reforms, Carlos VII has pressed forwards a reform program to finally evolve the Fueros system into a true autonomy granted to the Catalan and Basque. This will obviously render Madrid and the king both incapable of governing these provinces directly altogether, and will take a great deal of time to mitigate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00037;Italian Unification - The Papacy Under Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00037;In the height of Spanish supremacy in western europe, it maintained itself as the predominant defender of Catholic interests across the European continent, a sentiment that the traditionalist Carlists share greatly. In the wake of Italian unification, the Holy See has found itself greatly reduced, and indeed all but completely removed from the landscape of European politics. While Italy assures Europe that the religious authority of the Pope has in no way been diminished, this nationalistic order exists at potentially great detriment to the moral and traditional fabric of society, and must be dealt with swiftly if it is to be rectified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00038;The Ecclesiastical War - Spanish Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00038;As the guns settle in the Mediterranean, the Carlist forces have come out as clearly triumphant in the struggle over the soul of Catholic Europe. As such, we now have the option of dictating terms from a favorable position. Should we so choose, we can simply restore the Pope to his distinguished position on the peninsula, though this has been criticized as a far from permanent solution, as Italy could simply recover it later. Alternatively, we could enforce the Pope as the de facto head of the Italian nation itself, whilst claiming the islands of Sardinia and Sicily to ensure that this treaty can be enforced. Still more particularly militaristic advisors suggest that Italy be partitioned in its entirety, with the Pope being placed in charge of all his traditional holdings, whilst we ourselves lay claim to the rest of the peninsula in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00043;The Sacrilege Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00043;In the 1820s, under a royaliste supermajority, the Sacrilege laws were passed, rendering the acts of blasphemy and sacrilege illegal, under penalty of anything from forced labour to death. This highly controversial law has rarely been enforced, but has remained a prominent source of criticism against the highly religious government in Paris. This controversy has recently been reignited with the case of a known liberal agitator, an atheist, who has stolen several items from the local diocese, defaced them, then later returned them in a form of protest against the government. According to the law, he is meant to be executed, although this will undoubtedly anger the liberal population. To refuse to enforce the law in this case will in turn undermine its legitimacy. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00043;Enforce the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00043;Let it slide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00044;Belgian Independence - French intervention?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00044;In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, France was forced to cede the region of Belgium to the Netherlands, in order to turn the latter into a proper balancing power against potentially renewed French expansionism. These culturally French and religiously Catholic lands quickly began to chafe under Dutch rule, and have now risen in revolt against their prior overlords. With their control quickly slipping, the opportunity has come for us to make an offer: we restore order to Belgium, and in return Wallonia is returned to French rule, while Flanders is restored to the Netherlands, a deal the beleagured Dutch are quite likely to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00044;Send the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00044;Wallonia is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00045;Belgian Independence - Bourbon Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00045;In the midst of our catastrophic civil war, an offer has come by the French, opportunistically seeking the return of its lost Belgian territories. Should we accept this offer, the French will doubtlessly restore order to the lost provinces, but it will come at a great cost, that of Wallonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00045;We have little choice, accept the French offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00045;The cost is too high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00046;Belgian Independence - The Dutch Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00046;The Dutch have wisely accepted our offer to intervene in the Belgian crisis. Let us waste no further time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00046;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00047;Belgian Independence - The Dutch Refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00047;The Dutch have refused our generous offer, and we have no choice but to back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00047;Wallonia is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00048;What was that? Hand French territory over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00048;Belgian Independence - French victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00048;Our armies have marched victoriously into Belgium, as expected. In return, the Dutch will receive Flanders, but renege their cores on Wallonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00048;Cede to the Dutch what is theirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00049;Instability of the Bourbon Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00049;Despite the great unpopularity of the Bourbon monarchy, it has managed to weather the storm of public opinion, and has secured itself in place as a rightful continuation of the Ancien Regime before it. However, despite this, the liberal sect of the populace remains at great odds with the royalist powers that be, and this does not portend the end of instability within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00049;We will endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00050;Succession of Louis XIX;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00050;The late Charles X's health has been declining rapidly as of late, and with his old age it has become apparent that his end is nigh. As such, it has been decided that Charles X will abdicate in his dying days, leaving the throne to his heir presumptive, who will become known as Louis XIX. His legacy is one of both restoration and rot, the restoration of the old traditions and beliefs of France, but the rot of the very same liberties that the French people attained in the Revolution, his opposition to liberal reforms being the hallmark of his reign. Nevertheless, he will rest with his fathers before him, a king of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00050;Long live the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00051;Succession of Henri V;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00051;After just a short eight years of rule, Louis XIX has been found dead in his quarters. A man of military stature, he was at the forefront of anti-Bonapartiste sentiment in France, and was a major spearhead of the Bourbon restoration in France when he landed in Bourdeaux, and subsequently led Royaliste forces under the king for many years, even intervening in Spain during its own tumultuous fight against liberal elements. Now, however, aftr such a short reign, and in the midst of ever-increasing liberal agitation, he leaves his throne to Henri V.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00051;May his reign last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00052;Death of Henri V;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00052;Henri V, king of France, graced by God, has now passed. With him, the legitimate successors to the Bourbon line of Louis XIV has fully died out, and a new king must be selected. Some Legitimistes remain advocates of the absolutist line of the Bourbons, and have thus moved up the line to the Spanish Bourbons, otherwise known as the Carlist claimants to Spain. This is wildly unpopular, even among many monarchists, as this line is blatantly Spanish, and thus foreign to the French people, but selecting it opens the possibility of a power far outstripping that of most European powers, by uniting the Spanish and French thrones into one. Conversely, many Legitimistes have merged with the old Orleaniste movement, backing Philippe II, and thus adopting a more moderate, constitutionalist position. The choice remains ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00052;The throne shall pass to Jean III, the Spaniard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00052;The throne passes to Philippe II, and the constitution restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00053;Death of Jean III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00053;Jean III, King of France, rightful king of Spain, has died on this day, after only a short 5 year reign. With him, the line now passes to the next among the Spanish Carlists, a more conservative choice than the prior king. He shall be coronated as Charles XI of France. A military man, it is yet to be seen whether he will enforce the claim inherited by Jean III to the Spanish throne, or whether that eventuality remains little more than a pipe dream to the Bourbon throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00053;And so the crown passes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00054;Death of Charles XI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00054;On this day, Charles XI, king of France and the rightful heir to the Spanish throne, has died. He shall be followed by Jaime I. His procession is one of controversy, seen to some as a return to proper conservatism and a reaffirming of the noble privileges, and to others as a categorical failure, and a return to the reactionary politics so indicative of the Carlist and Legitimiste causes. Nonetheless, he shall be followed by Jaime, who inherits both the duchy of Madrid and the kingdom of Spain, to be titled Jaime III.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00054;Long live Jaime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00055;Death of Jaime I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00055;Jaime I has died, and shall be succeeded by Charles XII. His procession is one of little controversy or event, being one of a moderate, quiet-spoken monarch who will be remembered for little, praised for little, and hated for little. He shall be followed by Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, coronated as Alfonso I. A continuation of the Spanish line of Bourbons, it is feared that in the coming era this will hallmark a period of great instability for the French crown, though it remains to be seen whether these fears will come to pass or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00055;With a Heart of Iron France shall endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00056;The Farmers Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00056;In the years following the Bourbon Restoration, fears have spiked amongst the peasant populations of the kingdom that the old feudal privelegia amongst the noble elites will be restored, and the rights granted to the people by the French Revolution will be done away with by the Ancien Regime. In recent months this fear has appeared to become quite justified, as a controversy rocks the kingdom regarding a legal dispute between a petty nobleman and a small collective of businessmen whom bought out the territory, albeit from peasants who themselves confiscated it from the nobleman during the Revolution. The nobleman demanded that the land be returned to him, as well as the profits of the unlawful sale, citing his rightful ownership of the land as reason to declare both the land and the profits garnered from it as his, whilst the merchants refused to hand it over, citing free exchange as their right. The courts, staffed with royalist sympathizers, quickly ruled in favor of the nobleman, handing the land back to him. This event has become a fiasco, not just as other noblemen similarly deprived of land and status have begun making demands of a similar caliber, but as liberals have begun agitating once again over such concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00056;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00057;Nobility in the Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00057;Up until recently, France has been reliant on a military structure inherited from the days of the Bonaparte usurpation, promoted via merit rather than social status, and a conscription system that allows for a much larger military than the purely standing armies of days gone past. However, these reforms have come at a great cost to the political stability of the French realm, as many of the officers are no longer loyal to the king, and most have their loyalties placed with the Bonapartes they were hired from. This has caused for the French realm a situation wherein the keys to maintaining government power are largely placed in the hands of those that do not want to see the current government in power to begin with. The current administration has therefore suggested a series of reforms, seeking to dissolve the levy en masse altogether, and initiate a purge of Bonapartiste sympathizers in the military staff. This will undoubtedly weaken the military unduly, but may well save the throne from future insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00057;This is ludicrous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00057;A brilliant plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00058;Attempted Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00058;The army's loyalties have been held in question for a long time now, and now it has come to pass that these fears be proven justified. A Republican sect of the army has committed mutniy, and now is poised to seize control of the French countryside in the south of the country. While loyalist support in the military flocks north to regroup around Paris, this portends a civil war that could well cripple the French state for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00058;For the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00059;Coup Plot Thwarted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00059;The army's loyalties have been held in question for some time, even after the reforms passed by the late Louis XIX to reorganize their structure to better benefit the crown. As of recent, those fears have largely been put to rest, as a planned Republican coup was swiftly foiled by the royal army, having discovered the traitorous plot before it could be enacted. With renewed faith in the armed forces, the station of the Bourbon monarchy is finally secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00059;Long Live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00060;Civil war - Bourbon victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00060;With the guns finally going silent across continental France, it has become clear now that the Bourbon realm will be one to last. It has survived the liberal onslaught and the Ancien Regime remains intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00060;Vive la Bourbon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00061;Civil War - Republican Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00061;As the guns go silent across continental France, the last faction standing has shown itself to be that of the French Republic. Liberalism has finally triumphed, and the Ancien Regime is no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00061;Vive La France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00062;The Arpitan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00062;One place that the Bourbons did not expect to see resistance upon their return was the region of Arpitania, bordering the Swiss Commonwealth. Yet, as of late, liberal rebels have seized control of a decent part of the countryside, rebelling in the name of a so-called ''Arpitan Republic,'' under the hopes of...joining with Switzerland. These odd demands have left the government baffled, yet we have little choice but to put down this uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00062;Put down the uprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00062;For Liberte!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00063;France - The Spanish Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00063;While the traditionalist segment of the French population views the Bourbons as the rightful heirs to the Kingdom of France, even so the rise of a royal family blatantly foreign in character is a highly controversial one, and one more than likely to enflame tensions in the kingdom yet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00063;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00064;The Bourbon Realm Secure - Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00064;With the liberals soundly defeated in France, the Bourbon realm has found itself secure in its position, free to solve its internal disputes however it sees fit. First on the drawing board is how to deal with the liberal rot that has infested the French crown since the first rioters hit the streets in the Revolution. While the most radical of the Legitimiste supporters in the realm see fit to wholly do away with all liberalized reform and bring back the Ancien Regime in full, other more moderate parties see this as a surefire way to simply cause another such crisis again? in the future, and hope to chase a more moderate approach, seeing as how the revolution cannot so easily be undone. Still, some others find it fit to seek complete reconciliation with the liberals of the realm, and remodel the Bourbon monarchy into a truly modern, liberalizing force that the French people can surely back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00064;Le Liberalisme Est Morte!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00064;Restauration par la Moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00064;La Liberte Par La Restauration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00065;The Bourbon Realm Secure - Land Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00065;The land crisis that began in the 1830s has become an increasingly large pain in the side of the Bourbon administration, torn between the pull of popular opinion and modernization, and the opinions of the aristocracy that make up the backbone of the monarchy's support. With the continuing introduction of more efficient technologies into the French economy, the government finally has an opportunity to bring a definitive end to the agricultural crisis, but the question remains as to whom the remaining outstanding claims will revert to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00065;The land rightfully belongs to the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00065;Maybe the Carlists were onto something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00065;We shall simply forbid the reclamation efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00066;The Bourbon Realm Secure - Military Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00066;As the years have worn on, the purge of the upper staff, followed by extensive investment into the armed forces and modernization of its structure, the upper staff has finally recovered from the purges instituted in years past, and furthermore has become a well-maintained core staff akin to the Prussian model. While the army may never be able to reinstate the levy en masse, for fear of the same political instability coming to light again, the professional army may now prove sufficient to service the crown well enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00066;Finally, an army to be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00066;We are satisfied with simple loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00067;Recognition of the Polish Partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00067;With the rule of the Bourbon monarchy in Paris finding a distinct need to regain some measure of international legitimacy in the wake of the catastrophe that was the Napoleonic wars, the decision has been made to eject any pretenses of Polish recognition, at least in official circles, from French government. As such, any Polish committees will be banned from Paris and the kingdom as a whole, maps will be forbidden from including the Polish state on the map so long as it remains partitioned, and overtures will assure that France will never support any attempt at Polish reunification. This will undoubtedly drive a permanent wedge between the French and the Polish, but ultimately it is a sacrifice that must be made in order to cool down the tense relations France unfortunately has had to endure. (THIS REMOVES THE OPTION TO FORM PLC);;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00067;This will help secure peace, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00068;Reorienting Italian Policies - Reign in Two Sicilies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00068;While the Bourbon Realm is seeking to avoid major European conflict, as such an event could only damage it further, the fact remains that to maintain security the monarchy must maintain some degree of dynamism in its foreign policy in order to maintain its status as a major power on the world stage. As it stands, the realm of Two Sicilies has a close relationship with the monarchy, and much like our own realm, struggles to maintain its status in the face of the rising tide of liberalism. As such, it has been posited that the bourbon kingdom come to a closer relationship with our crown. By reigning in this major realm in southern europe, we can ensure that French influence be maintained in Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00068;Send the offer. (3 infamy if accepted);;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00068;Dont bother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00069;Bourbon Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00069;With the Bourbon realms across Europe becoming increasingly threatened by a rising tide of liberalism, the Bourbon monarchs in France have suggested that we become a vassal - a client state of the Kingdom of France. To accept this offer would be to shirk our own independence in favor of security, but to refuse may raise the ire of Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00069;Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00069;Refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00070;The Sicilians have Accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00070;The Kingdom of Two Sicilies has accepted our generous offer, and has become a loyal vassal of the French crown. This has secured French influence in the south of Italy for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00070;A bloodless victory, as intended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00071;The Sicilians have refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00071;The Bourbons in Two Sicilies seem more secure in their rule than we presumed, and have rejected our offer of protection. Now, we can simply back down, with a minor loss of prestige, or we can force the issue, and subjugate them unwillingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB00071;Request? Sorry, we meant demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00072;The Anglo-French War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00072;While the Bourbon realm may generally seek to avoid conflict on the European mainland, save to maneuver itself favourably to ensure its continued place as a European power, the Bourbons still yet have a bone to pick with the British in particular. With our fleet modernized and prepared for another bout, conflict has now become inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00072;A perfect opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00072;We cannot afford such a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00073;The Anglo-French War - French victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00073;Despite great doubt to the contrary, the French kingdom has emerged victorious in its struggle against Perfidious Albion and may now claim the spoils. The only question now is exactly what to claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA00074;How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00075;German policy - non-intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00075;The Bourbon realm, always fearing for its continued security, has a unique opportunity in front of it. Prussia and Austria are both coming to blows in Central Europe, and France plays a key role in the region that could decisively shift the balance of power in its favor. The Bourbons, always keen to back a conservative party of interest in Europe to secure its own throne, will place forth an offer to the victorious NGF that it will not intervene in any attempt to form a united German state, and in return, the Germans will not violate its rule over the important Alsace-Lorraine. This could only go well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00075;Forward the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00075;Are you insane?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00076;Bourbon offer of neutrality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00076;The Bourbon realm to the west has offered to willingly relinquish its stake in Germany for merely a guarantee of remaining neutral on the province of Alsace-Lorraine. While that land may be rightfully German, it may be in our interests to allow the French to keep that territory, if that forgoes a war we could potentially lose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00076;Accept the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00076;Refuse, it is ours as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00077;Our offer has been declined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00077;The Prussians have refused our offer to remain neutral, and have thus stated their intent to seize Alsace-Lorraine in the near future. This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00077;How could it have possibly gone wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00078;Treaty of Alsace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00078;The Germans have accepted our deal regarding the status of Alsace-Lorraine and the recognition of a united Germany. While they may reinstate their claims later, this brings peace for now, which is all that matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00078;Peace in our time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00079;The coronation of the Bourbon Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00079;A strange tide befalls the peoples of western Europe, as, almost anachronistically, a personal union has come to radically upend the balance of power in the European continent. In the midst of the liberal revolutions, the rise of nationalism and nation-states, and an era where the Ancien Regime was thought to have died with the advent of modern liberalism, it is the forces of traditionalism, of dynastic politics stretching back centuries, that have found themselves in this prime position. Now, the Bourbon King of France and the Carlist king of Spain are one and the same, uniting the two realms of Europe into a single state. This coronation vindicates the eternal beliefs of the traditionalist nobility and upper society, but raises the ire of not only the upstart liberals and nationalists, but falls in brazen violation of the treaty of Utrecht, which forbade the union of the lines of France and Spain. This action poses an existential threat to the balance of power in Europe, and undoubtedly there will be a vitriolic response from the international community. It is doubtless that the coming years will be ones of unmatched turbulence since the days of Napoleon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00079;We will endure the tide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00080;Confederazione Italiana;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00080;With the rise of the Bourbon Empire as a unified entity, it has come to pass that, inevitably, mutual security become more important than individual squabbles over such issues as Italian unification.

EVTNAME00086;The Declaration of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00086;In the aftermath of the Bourbon Empire's declaration, the geopolitical situation in Europe has rapidly altered its course in response. Fears of a Franco-Spanish domineering force across the European continent has spurred on a fearful response unseen since the days of Napoleon Bonaparte himself. The brazen violation of the treaty of Utrecht has not gone unnoticed, and the beginnings of an international coalition have come into being. A declaration has been issued from the powers, meeting in Prague, declaring the state of the Bourbon Empire to be an illegitimate construct of a state and an existential threat to peace in Europe. It is expected that within a year, the empires of Europe will make their move. Whether we weather the storm or not will determine if the Bourbon Empire has a future in the world to begin with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00086;We will weather the storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00087;The Second War of Spanish Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00087;The powers of Europe have now made their move, in hopes of putting an end to the personal union between Spain and France. With little room for error and little chance of leniency should the French nation fail to assert itself for a third time in recent memory, the result of this war will determine the fate of both realms, perhaps for the rest of the century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00089;The Peace of Lubeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00089;Despite our best efforts, the realm of the Bourbon Empire has been beaten and broken by the vast efforts of the coalition levied against it. In the aftermath of the war, the Empire has been forced to split into its contituent parts, neither of which permitted to house the House de Bourbon any longer, but rather emplaced under responsible governments set up by the victors to ensure this situation never occurs again. The Empire is broken, and will likely never rise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00089;We have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00090;The Peace of Montpellier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00090;Despite the best efforts of the international community, the superiority of Franco-Spanish arms on the field has been proven definitively over those of the powers arrayed against the Bourbon Empire. As the guns fall silent, Europe has been forced to acknowledge the existence of the rising power in the west, and to recognize the union between France and Spain as legitimate, undoing the treaty of Utrecht once and for all. While this, at least for the time being, ends the external threat to the existence of the monarchy, there yet remains many internal challenges for the Empire to sort out if it seeks to take its place in the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00094;With the unification of the two joint realms of France and Spain and the quiet of peace comes the first major crisis of the union, that being the issue of language. While the two realms have often been very close diplomatically, culturally they are very far apart, and linguistically even more so. While a simple solution would be to remain bilingual, that would clearly come at great cost to the organization and structure of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00094;The king is Spanish, so too should the realm be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00094;France is the stronger realm, so too should the kingdom be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00094;The two realms are codependent and equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00095;A Leftist Spring;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00095;The dualist character of the Bourbon realm has caused a great upset in both the French and Spanish sections of the empire a great upset, as both parties considered themselves rightfully the leaders of the union, and much expected the Bourbon realm to merely be an extension of their own. With this, the idea of the Ancien Regime itself being a foreign concept, an occupation by elites of a royalist character, has become increasingly prominent in social circles. Socialists and Communists alike have gained much by capitalizing on this resentment, promoting a separation of the two artificially fused realms. While conservatives and traditionalists alike remain loyal, violence is doubtlessly soon to commence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00095;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00096;Bombing of Toulouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00096;Despite the unpopularity of the Bourbon realm, the last few weeks have still remained somewhat quiet, the unrest in the streets little more than hushed words and quiet assemblies. In recent events, that has finally changed. A public square in Toulouse has been bombed, and moreso by a radical leftist movement proclaiming itself the Occitan People's Front, wearing the skin of romantic nationalism in order to push a proletarian revolution in the south of the country. This does not bode well for the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00096;Occitan nationalism? What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00097;The Occitan People's Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00097;Unrest among the socialist strata of society has hit a peak, with a large group of communist militants seceding in the south, proclaiming themselves to be the Occitan People's Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00097;Are you serious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00098;The Spanish Republican Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00098;While the Bourbon Realm unified the two lines of the French and Spanish Bourbons, it did not resolve the unfortunate political disputes in Spain proper between the Carlists, the very same line on the throne of the Bourbon empire, and the liberal Christinos. Whereas in recent years the latter have increasingly moved their support away from royal squabbles and into the realm of liberal revolution, the divide continues to exist within our empire. With the character of our monarchy taking one distinctly separate from that of a Spanish nationality, the liberals in Spain have mounted a resistance to our rule, and undoubtedly will soon strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00098;These fools again? We already won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00099;The Spanish Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00099;Despite the best efforts of the Bourbon realm, the unification process has been tenuous and slow, especially with fears across Spain that the union is taking on a character that will inevitably lead to full subjugation of the Spanish people under a French heel. This has unfortunately led to a great deal of liberal unrest in the Castilian section of the nation. As of now, this has now blown up into full-scale secessionist revolution against the government. We must put down this Spanish Republic immediately if we wish to secure the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00099;We will put this revolt down like any other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00100;The French National Front;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00100;Despite the best efforts of the Bourbon monarchy to keep the French people in line, fears of foreigner domination have come to dominate French society, and nationalists have taken the union as a great source of propaganda, showing off the Spanish character of the monarchs and the seeming preference for Spanish ways of life over those of France as a clear indication that the French people are under threat of foreign oppression, and by a people historically subservient to their interests, no less. These nationalists have come to form the French National Front, a paramilitary organization dedicated to ''liberating'' the French people from the Bourbon monarchy, and to establish a true nationalist republic in their wake. This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00100;We will not let go of our crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00101;The French National Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00101;Despite our best efforts to maintain order among the French populace, the unrest caused by the French National Front has proved too great to contain. Riots have devolved into open rebellion against the central government, proclaiming for themselves a nationalist republic in Paris, and even taking to their cause a great deal of our own armed forces. Should we fail to put this down, we may well lose grip on the empire as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00101;We will put this rabble down like before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00104;We can do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00116;Integrating Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00116;Ever since the Polish Partition, the Poles have long languished under foreign rule, including our own. However, whilst the Prussians and Russians have oppressed Poles to a great degree, the Austrian Empire has given to them a relatively light burden, compared to the struggles they face elsewhere. With the conquest of Poland complete, the kingdom can be integrated into the empire wholesale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00116;Dissolve Galicia, Integrate Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00200;The Restoration of Etrutia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00200;The Kingdom of Etruria was a short-lived kingdom in the Italian peninsula, created by Napoleon I as a form of compensation to the Spanish line of Bourbon-Parma, and ultimately dissolved in 1815. With our success in overturning this aspect of the congress of Vienna, the kingdom can be restored, securing further Bourbon gains in the Italian peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00201;The Treaty of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00201;The belligerent Sardinian kingdom has been defeated on the battlefield definitively, putting an end to their expansionist ambitions in the Italian peninsula. To ensure the continued security of both Austria and France, the state is to be effectively dismantled, its kindom split in twain, French majority regions handed back to the kingdom of France, and Genoa released once more as an independent republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00201;This will undoubtedly bring stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00202;Construction finished on Versailles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00202;The Versailles Palace, after many years of reconstruction, renovation, and restoration, has finally been restored to working order, and the court culture of the palace has once again turned it into the diplomatic and cultural capital of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00202;And all it took was our entire economy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00203;Renewing the Franco-Bavarian Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00203;Naturally, as the French court reasserts itself as the diplomatic axis around which Europe spins, one of the first matters to attend to is Germany. By strategically influencing and allying ourselves with the Bavarians once more, a feat much helped by their monarch's own romantic leanings, the Bourbons can drive a wedge into German affairs once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00203;Naturally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00204;The Carlist War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00204;The Liberals in Spain have defied our prior enforcement of the absolutist rule of the Bourbon line and brought about a pragmatic sanction to cement their own rule over our neighbor, denying Carlos the right to his rule. Catalans and Basque have rallied behind him to dispute this unlawful succession, and while we may stand by and do nothing, many in our administration advocate immediate intervention to secure a long term ally...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00204;How many times do we need to teach you this lesson, old man?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00204;We have enough problems already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00205;Carlist War - French Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00205;The unlawful Christinos have been deposed and French forces once again march triumphantly throughout Spain, bearing the banner of the French crown alongside the Burgundian Cross of Spain. Now, the question remains of how to administer our ally, whether to trust them to rule alone or to take more direct responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00205;The crown is restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00205;Keep Spain under surveillance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00205;Keep Spain controlled, and seize Cuba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00206;Carlist War - Spanish Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00206;We have successfully repulsed even the French from our lands, preventing another repeat of the Bourbon tyranny within our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00206;Viva La Espana!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00207;Codigo Abolicion Espanol;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00207;Throughout the history of the Spanish Empire, a large anti-slavery tract has existed, dating back to the early 1600s with declarations against the trade and laws forbidding the acquisition and sale of native americans as slaves. Despite multiple efforts to limit or abolish the trade and the practice on the part of the Spanish state, due to political realities and extensive contraband slaves still arrive to Cuba in record numbers, and the political opposition of Cuban slaveholders still drastically influences Spanish policy. With continued political reforms, an opportunity has arisen to finally abolish the trade and practice across the empire, fulfilling the obligations Spain made to abolishing the practice in 1820.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00207;We must destroy the trade at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00208;Carlist Distributism - Cuba;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00208;Distributist measures taken in the Spanish mainland have thus far proven quite successful, prompting some in the more abolitionist camp of government to propose expanding the program well beyond the shores of Spain proper, and to extend it to the colonial holdings of Cuba and Puerto Rico as well. To do so would cost a great investment from the Spanish coffers, but could prove invaluable to recovering the island possessions' respective economies in the aftermath of abolition by handing landed estates to freed slaves and to those peninsulares whom have yet to benefit on the mainland. However, this will doubtlessly earn further ire from former slaveholders on the islands, and may yet prove another challenge for Spanish authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00208;What a brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00208;Who cares about the islands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00301;The Barbarization Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00301;The Barbarization Plan was a supposed plan to enslave, kill, and deport the vast majority of Greeks in the mainland of Greece in order to repopulate the region with settlers from the Levant and Egypt. While this was never officially acknowleged by the Turkish government, a combination of massacres, pogroms, and atrocities in Ottoman held territory, as well as private statements by generals involved in the campaign, highly suggest that this plan, or at least a variation of it, would have been enacted in the event of an Ottoman victory. The cities of the empire are purged of their Hellene inhabitants, civilians, soldiers, bureaucrats all alike purged from their posts, dislanded, and most even enslaved. Massacres accompany the Turkish reprisals, further pogroms being enacted in Constantinople, Trebizond, and all other territories the Ottomans retain. As slaves are deported across the whole of Greece, Arabs from Egypt and the Levant, particularly those who aided in putting an end to the rebellion, are given the land in their stead. This event has been condemned across the whole of Europe, but the powers of the west have already proven their ineffectual nature in preventing an Ottoman reconquest. Even so, there are few left whom they can carry the torch for. Almost certainly, this is the end of the Hellenic peoples of the world, and the end of their civilization as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00301;Such are the wages of rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00302;Collapse of Ottoman Authority;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00302;The complete and utter defeat of the Sultan's armies by the rebellious Greek uprising came as a shock to the world, which just a few short years earlier had to intervene to prevent the complete defeat of the Greeks. The capture of Constantinople by the rebellion led to a total breakdown of civil authority across the Ottoman empire, and in this defeat the Ottoman Empire has been reduced to naught but a rump state in Anatolia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00302;At least we don't have to worry about minorities anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00303;Retribution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00303;The Greek uprising against the Ottomans was a bloody one, characterized by a distinct lack of mercy on both sides. In Greek-occupied territory, Turks were hunted down and killed until there were none left, and the same sort of action characterized the Turkish war effort. The brutality of the war was unspeakable, with families whom had known each other for years not being spared from the ethnic and religious turmoil that engulfed the former Ottoman Empire in the event of the Filiki Etarias assuming control. With the success of the Greek rebellion, the Turkish people left stranded in Rhomaion territory are ill-prepared for the death that arrives at their doorstep, and unlike when the Ottomans persecuted the Greeks, there is little chance or will for outside intervention. For those Muslims that find themselves in Greek territory, shut doors and hushed whispers are their only defense against the bloody retribution that faces them and their children, deserved or not. The Rhomaion speak of the Saint Virgin Mary granting them a mandate to destroy the entirety of the Turkish civilization, and the Bosporus runs red with the bloated, decaying bodies of men, women, and children murdered within the city walls and dumped into the Bosporus. Ottoman forces that otherwise would have intervened are nowhere to be found, or their disorganized remnants have joined the civilians in being massacred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00303;But they deserve it, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00304;The Basileia Tos Rhomaion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00304;The Filiki Etarias has succeeded in the goal it set out for itself in the Greek revolution, despite all attempts by the Turks to defeat it and by foreign powers to limit it. The Rhomaion people now forge their own destiny on the world stage, a restoration of the glory of the ancient peoples of Rome imagined in the modern day, and an overturning of the disaster of 1453. The Empire of the Romans will suffer many tribulations in the years to come, but this will always be remembered as the day the peoples of Rome saw their final liberation from the Ottoman yoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00304;The Empire of Kings has returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00305;The Countryside War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00305;Despite military victory, and an official treatise with the Ottoman Empire concerning their expulsion from Europe and from much of Anatolia, the reality on the ground is far less cut and dry. Turkish gendarmie and partisans still roam much of the countryside, raiding and invading territories across the mutual border. On the European side, Albanian bandits and Bulgarian nationalists on our side of the border still engage in military resistance against the empire. Without comprehensive investment in the army, there is little that can be done to prevent further bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00305;I thought the war was over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00306;The Klephts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00306;Useful to the cause of rebellion was a class of people in the countryside known as the Klephts. Opposed to Ottoman rule, these partisans proved exceptionally useful in securing Greek independence. However, with the hostilities ceased, even if only in name, the klephts have become problematic. Little more than thieving bandits, they comprise a large portion of the Rhomaion armed forces, and use their position to extract bribes from the local populace, as well as obfuscate corrupt dealings behind the prestige of their status as 'war heroes.' If the Rhomaion state is to modernize, the klephts must be reigned into state control and their corruption ceased, one way or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00306;I kinda like the bribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00307;Phanariote Corruption;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00307;The Phanariote class, during the reign of the Ottoman Empire, made up a substantial portion of the administration of the Ottoman provinces, and even took charge of a large portion of the merchant class and aristocracy. Now, with independence secured, the Phanariote class has established its own control over much of the bureaucracy. Skilled diplomats and administrators all, their benefits would be felt throughout the state, if their skills were applied more to administration and less to lining their own pockets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00307;More bribes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00308;Rouspheti Traditions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00308;The bureaucracy of the Rhomaion state inherits certain predispositions regarding how the bureaucracy should function, most notably how the wheels of the state should turn. State officials routinely accept Rouspheti, that is to say, gifts and bribes, in order to move policy in favor of those who pay, or simply to move the state at all. This has resulted in a deeply backwards, bloated, and slow state apparatus. It will take time, effort, and much investment to change this cultural outlook amongst the bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00308;MORE BRIBES?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00309;The State Within the State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00309;The Orthodox Church remains a powerful institution within the Rhomaion empire, and its power is unmatched in matters ecclesiastical. Normally a source of great prestige for the country, the power of the church is worrisome in how far it extends into the realm of the political. A landed body in and of itself, the church takes a powerful position within the affairs of state, proving more often than not to be a roadblock to meaningful change in the path to modernization. Until this issue is settled, in favor of the church or of the state, the status quo benefits few in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00309;God Willing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00310;The Kojdabashi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00310;The Kojdabashi are an aristocratic class in the Rhomaion state, dating back to before the acquisition of the empire by the Turks in the 15th century. The aristocratic class is one that is deeply engrained in the social strata of the state, and plays a large role in the organization of the Rhomaion empire. Opposed thoroughly to the merchant classes of the state, this strata will work tirelessly to prevent the industrialization of the realm until it is reigned in, by one means or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00310;They will be curbed in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00311;The Commerce Monopoly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00311;The Phanariotes have another realm in which they govern much of our state, namely the world of commerce. Phanariote vessels control a majority share of virtually all external trade heading into and out of the realm, leaving us deeply dependent on their cooperation...and therefore, lining their pockets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00311;At least we can still get bananas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00312;Coastal Piracy;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00312;Despite our victory over the Ottoman Empire, coastal piracy remains a major threat to the security of the empire in Constantinople. Egyptian, Meghrebi, and even several Ottoman vessels still plague our coaastline as if the war never ended, raiding coastal settlements and taking the population as captives. Without a large naval presence in the Aegean, there is little we can do to stop this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00312;That has got to be the worst pirate I've ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00313;An Empire of Rot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00313;While the state we have created bears the title of the ancient empire of the Romans, its status only exists as a mere pale reflection of the glories of old. Without a powerful army to speak of, politically divided, economically and societally backwards, and lacking all but the most core regions of the Rhomaion state, our nation stands as an empire of rot, inheritor of the very same deformities that plagued our oppressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00313;Oh, my empire of dirt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00314;The End of the Countryside War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00314;With the enlargement of the Rhomaion army into a force of sizable stature, the empire is finally in a position to force an end to the raids and unrest that has plagued the countryside thus far. With the Anatolian frontier finally under control, a decision must be come to as to how we must approach the remaining Turkish presence in Roman Anatolia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00314;Send the remainder across the border, peacefully of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00314;They can remain, under supervision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00315;Disempowering the Klephts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00315;The Klephts have for a long time been a problematic thorn in the side of the Rhomaion military structure, a corrupt bunch of bandits and thieves that use their status in the military in order to extract substantial bribes. With recent investment into the command of the Rhomaion army, the choice is now ours on how to proceed dealing with these corrupt war heroes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00315;Integrate the Klephts as a gendarme;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00315;Disown and purge the Klephts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00316;Reigning in the Phanariotes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00316;The Phanariotes have played a large role in the diplomacy and administration of the realm. With our investments into the financial and dipomatic realms bearing fruit, we now have the opportunity to face down their corruption, and make a decision on how to address this class of diplomats moving forwards, and how we can use their diplomatic strengths to benefit us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00316;Their diplomatic expertise proves handy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00316;We prefer a more aggressive strand of diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00317;Undoing the Rouspheti Tradition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00317;The Rouspheti tradition, the exchanging of gifts and personal favors in order to keep the wheels of state turning, is one that has remained pervasive across Rhomaion society until recently. Now, however, with the modernizing of the state and cultural apparatus of the empire, the tradition can be done away with and replaced with a more favorable tradition for the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00317;Their corruption can be useful to increase funding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00317;Efficiency at all costs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00318;Of Church and State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00318;The Orthodox church during Ottoman rule served as the only government entity of the old Byzantine empire that survived in its totality, and as such grew immensely in power as the sole representative of the Rhomaion people during the Turkish occupation. This status quo has left the cultural institutions of the empire in a standstill. Now, with investment having been made to this field of the nation, a decision can be made as to where the church will stand in the nation going forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00318;The Empire is absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00318;The Church is absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00319;Reigning the Kodjabashi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00319;The Kodjabashi, a class of nobility that date to the Ottoman takeover of the old Rhomaion empire, have maintained until now a large share of the economy and political class of the state. Hardcore traditionalists, their interests are directly opposed to industrial expansion. With substantial investment in the industrial economy, we now have a position to force the issue and end their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00319;Integrate them and grant them noble titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00319;Cast them out, we must modernize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00320;The Phanariote Commerce Monopoly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00320;The Phanariotes until now have enjoyed a comprehensive monopoly on the commerce of the Rhomaion realm, and as such have effectively revoked state control over its own foreign commerce. With investment having been made in the economy of the realm, Phanariote control has eroded enough to determine what to do with their class moving forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00320;Their monopoly could be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00320;Let me just get my hammer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00321;The End of Coastal Piracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00321;The last of the coastal pirates in the Aegean have been done away with, and their equipment and leadership has been seized by the state. Now, the only question left is what we must do with the bountiful harvest we have captured from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00321;THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST PIRATE IVE EVER SEEN;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00321;"Pirate Expertise?" Go home, you're drunk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00322;Coastline Raided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00322;The accursed pirates raiding our coastline have struck again, burning and looting settlements before dispersing by the time any reinforcements could arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00322;That has got to be the worst pirate I've ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00323;An Empire of Bronze;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00323;The Empire of the Rhomaion marches onwards. Still a backwards nation in many ways, glimmers of hope yet still arise, illuminating the potential for recovery and growth. Now is the time of rebuilding and consolidating, so that these glimmers may yet become a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00323;Bronze Age Jumpscare;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00324;Thrace Protected;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00324;With the acquisition of Northern Thrace and Macedonia, the northern border of the empire has stabilized, at least for now. With the proverbial foot in the door, the Basileia Tos Rhomaion can begin to take a leading role in Balkan affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00324;Let's hope it isn't cut off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00325;An Empire of Silver;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00325;The Basileia Tos Rhomaion is finally beginning to resemble, if not a truly modern state, a functioning one with landed institutions and some vestiges of economic and military prowess begining to show. Even if the realm may not yet rise to the forefront of geopolitical affairs, it is at least worthy of consideration at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00325;An empire of spoons and forks, silverware for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00326;Bulgaria Reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00326;Bulgaria, the long-standing rival of the Byzantine empire, has been vanquished by the Rhomaion people once again, as they were during the reign of Basil II. With this border secured, the empire of the Romans can finally call its northern border that of the Danube again, for the first time since six hundred years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00326;The name "Bulgar-slayer" ring any bells?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00327;Western Balkans Reclaimed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00327;The western balkans, historically the northern frontier of the Byzantine empire, have finally been reclaimed by their rightful owners, bringing the Orthodox peoples of the region back together for the first time since before the 4th Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00327;Unity at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00328;Anatolia Retaken;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00328;The Anatolian frontier, after centuries of Islamic, Turkish rule, has been restored to the Rhomaion people finally. Further has the empire marched now than it ever has since the days of the Komnenos dynasty, and this territorial restoration has exceeded even Manuel Komnenos' efforts to recover the hinterlands of the peninsula. Surely, further glories must await us after this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00328;Nice borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00329;An Empire of Marble;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00329;The Basileia Tos Rhomaion, finally, enters the world stage not as a ruinous shadow of its former self, not as a secondary member of negotiations mentioned only in passing, but as a true power. While they still refer to the nation as the "Empire of the Greeks," and most typically refuse to recognize the title claimed by the empire, slowly but surely public opinion is beginning to sway in favor of the latter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00329;So close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00330;Armenia Reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00330;The lands of Armenia have been reclaimed in their entirety, bringing the foremost provinces of the realm that were lost in the battle of Manzikert back under Imperial control. With these lands integrated, the issue of Armenian nationalism has been brought into question for perhaps the first time since the peoples were integrated into the bureaucracy. The once rather negligible minorities of Georgians and Armenians have become sizable expanses of the nation, and their calls for independence, which once aided our conquests, have become thorns in our own side. While their fears can be alleviated by integrating their languages fully into the imperial state apparatus, this will come at severe cost to our administrative efficiency. We must ask ourselves now, is the Empire Rhomaion, or are its people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00330;The people are Rhomaion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00330;The Empire is Rhomaion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00331;An Empire of Gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00331;The Rhomaion Empire, a title for long that has languished in the face of opposition from those that would deny the people of Constantinople its prestige and honor, has finally reclaimed its place at the forefront of the world stage. The title of "Roman" has gone from a formality to a colloquialism of diplomatic discourse, no longer a proclamation or a title but rather a statement of mere reality, and the cultural exchange of what once was called Hellenic has become a prestigious and well-regarded tradition, one many would be proud to inherit. The Empire has been restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00331;A Pax Romana Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00332;The Levant Reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00332;Heraclius spoke of the Levant in the 600s, after suffering a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Islamic Caliphate, and he said of the territory that it was a beautiful province, and that it would serve the caliphs well. His prediction proved to be quite apt. The Muslims took great use of these lands, and our empire languished in their absence. With the restoration of these lands into the empire, however, comes the integration of more christianized populations, populations that will undoubtedly seek their own rights within the empire as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00332;We will integrate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00332;We embrace our fellow Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00333;The Jewel Reclaimed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVDESC00333;The Jewel of the Rhomaion Empire, the breadbasket of Egypt, has been reclaimed in the name of God and of the Rhomaion peoples. The territory that once served as the breadbasket for the Rhomaiin empire fell not long after the Levant did, and its reacquisition will once again turn this fertile land into the same breadbasket it once was. Meanwhile, the local Copts have proven to be a possible point by which the empire can appeal to the locals, however, this will once again severely strain the bureaucracy of the empire, and will no doubt be unpopular in so far as the state will be giving preferential tratment to a distinct minority of the Egyptian populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00333;We will accept them, as long as they become Rhomaion.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00333;We accept all Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00334;The Thassos Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00334;The island of Thassos, populated only by peoples of the Rhomaion realm, was occupied by the Egyptians during our war of independence, and to this day the Egyptians administer it how they wish. This island is strategically placed directly to the south of our Macedonian holdings, and allows Egypt to project their navy all along the coastline, as well as harbor the very pirates that threaten our realm now. We may demand the island be returned to us, and the Egyptians vacate the land, but undoubtedly they will have demands of their own, seeing as Ali has had ambitions on our land since the war of independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00334;We will demand the island be returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00334;This sounds like a terrible idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00335;The Hellenes Demand Thassos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00335;The Hellenic peoples, high off of their successes against the rotting Ottoman Empire, have dained to demand the island of Thassos, which we have occupied since 1813 as a just reward for fending off the Wahhabists in Arabia. While the island is of little worth on its own, escalating this dispute by posing an outrageous price for the island may be an apt decision on our own part, allowing us to seize substantially more territory should they refuse and negotiations break down...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00335;Demand Cyprus and Crete in return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00335;We do not want war with the Hellenes. The island is worth little, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00336;Egyptian Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00336;The treacherous Egyptians have demanded the islands of Cyprus and Crete in return for the island of Thassos! The deal they offer is undoubtedly a horrendously high price for the land we seek, and undoubtedly is being forwarded in order to force a breakdown of negotiations. Should we refuse this offer, Egypt will most certainly seek war in order to take far more than just those two islands from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00336;Damn it all, give them what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00336;Break the negotiations, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00337;The Return of Thassos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00337;Unexpectedly, the Egyptians have backed down from the island of Thassos, and have benevolently granted us control of the island for no cost at all. Egyptian naval vessels and military personnel have begun to evacuate the island, and the transfer of civilian authority to Rhomaion governors has begun to take place across the small island, ensuring a safe transition of power between our two realms. Surely they are intimidated by our invincible military might!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00337;How nice of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00338;Greece Breaks Negotiations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00338;As expected, the Greeks have broken off negotiations, and their response to our 'generous' offer was one of disdain, clearly insulted by the boldness of our demands. With negotiations breaking down, we now have a valid cause to go to war, in order to maintain our honor in the Mediterranean, as well as what rewards defending it brings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00338;To War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00338;On second thought, they can keep the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00339;The War is Going Poorly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00339;The war against the Hellenes is going substantially worse than expected. Our armies are distinctly outnumbered by the Hellenic forces they face off against, whether because of our own lack of preparation or due to defeats on the battlefield, or a combination of both. Victory as we sought it is unlikely to come to us, and we no longer have the capacity to keep the island under our control, let alone expand into Greece as was intended. It would be apt to cut our losses and pursue peace with them, so that we may lick our wounds in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00339;The war is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00339;They have but shaved our beard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00340;The Egyptians Surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00340;The Egyptians have begun forwarding diplomatic feelers, bringing up the possibility of an end to hostilities, and an Egyptian withdrawal from the island of Thassos to end this bloody conflict. Undoubtedly, their nose has been bloodied in a bout that they did not expect to go this poorly, and they seek a quick exit from a war they stand little chance of winning now. We ourselves may not be in a much better position, so perhaps it would be wise to accept this offer of peace, lest the war go south going forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00340;The war is concluded. Accept their offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00340;They think it's only the island we want now? Cute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00341;The Egyptians Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00341;The Egyptians have been defeated both on sea and on land, in a stunning victory many would have deemed impossible, same as how many would have deemed it impossible that the Turks would have been defeated. Their armies have been devastated both on sea and on land, and the government of Ali has been forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the armies of Rhomania on the field, and pay substantial indemnities to our state in return for the cessation of hostilities. The island of Thassos has been reclaimed, and the experience this war has brought, fighting against an army on modern european lines, will prove invaluable to our developing nation going forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00341;The Pharoah's Staff is Broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00342;The Hellenes Have Surrendered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00342;The Hellenic 'empire' has surrendered as expected to our markedly superior military forces, and has been forced to give up its territory in the Aegean, as well as their lands in Attica and the Peloponnese, which the Ottomans promised to us as compensation for aiding him against the Hellenic rebellion that ended their empire. These territories now belong to Egypt, a foothold for Ali on the European continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00342;The Hellenes have been crushed, as expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00343;A Minor Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00343;The Egyptians have been thwarted in their attempts to conquer our realm, although we have proven incapable of forcing any terms on them. Their forces have steadily begun to withdraw from Thassos, as their outpost there has come to be a needless expense in the face of our opposition on the continent. While no treaty may have been signed to end this war, and no territory has been officially exchanged, this ends the Egyptian occupation of Thassos for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00343;The island is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00344;The Lazican Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00344;Upon the acquisition of the Lazican territory by the revived Rhomaion state, it was initially presumed that the local Lazicans would accept Rhomaion rule rather easily, considering their cultural heritage as part of the Georgian realm, which enjoyed strong relations with the Rhomaion peoples for many years in its heyday. However, the local population has long since converted to Islam, and quickly it has been found that they do not associate strongly with the renewed order in the Trebizod region. They have begun to agitate heavily for independence from the realm, organizing into militias to oppose imperial rule, and it is not unlikely that shots will be fired soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00344;We must keep order.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00345;The Balkan Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00345;With the fall of Constantinople into Greek hands, the Turkish yoke over the whole of the Balkan world is ending. Premier amongst the new entities arising from local entities is that of Bulgaria, the traditional powerhouse of the Danube, and most likely the future rival to Byzantine expansion. The Turks across the whole of Bulgaria flee inevitable persecution, taking what they can and being led alongside what Ottoman authorities remain in a retreat to Anatolia. The loss of life in this operation is remarkably minimal, thanks to the efforts of a certain Turkish officer in the region, whom facilitated an organized evacuation campaign of the civilians, using what soldiers the Ottoman government had left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00345;Freedom at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00346;The Balkan Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00346;With the fall of Constantinople into Greek hands, the peoples of the Balkans have become free from the Turkish yoke, and one of the largest benefactors of this destruction is that of the Serbian peoples. The Serbians have always been of a rebellious stature amongst the Balkan subjects of the Ottomans, and with the loss of Turkish authority all pretenses of loyalty to the Sultan have been cast aside. In a last ditch effort, the Ottoman authorities, rallied by a remarkable model of Ottoman military command, have vacated the region, taking as many civilians with them as humanly possible, si as to spare them from the horrors that would undoubtedly await those families unlucky enough to remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00346;Freedom at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00347;The Ottoman Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00347;The loss of Constantinople has proven devastating to the Turkish realm. Nearly all of the empire's bureaucratic resources were invested in the city and its placement as the imperial capital of the empire. The Hellene revolutionaries, upon breaching its walls, were able to systematically eradicate the capacity of the empire to govern its vast territories, causing the de facto end of the Ottoman empire as it had been built since the 1400s, and the Sultan's line went missing in this time, presumed dead. This devastating collapse was only mitigated by the consolidation of Turkish forces in the interior by a particular officer, whose efforts saved many lives in what was otherwise a horrific event in Turkish history. Now, the government must regroup and reorganize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00347;The end is surely upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00348;The Janissaries Seize Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00348;The Janissary corps, a previously dissolved and disowned military organization in the Ottoman government, now remains as one of the few bodies with officials left alive and intact following the collapse of the administration. Seizing this opportunity, these disgraced remnants of the body that once caused so much harm to the administration in years past has taken control of the reins of state, forming a provisional government so as to decide the future of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00348;This can only end poorly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00349;The Coronation of a New Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00349;The Janissary provisional government has wasted no time in selecting a new Sultan from among its own ranks, an officer whose position had survived the purge in 1830, and whose actions in the aftermath of the collapsing Ottoman war effort saved a great deal of Turkish lives. The man in recent months became something of a folk hero, a clearly popular and obvious choice for the organization whose legitimacy rests on a knife's edge. This sultan is coronated in a swift and inglorious manner, much of the regalia of the Ottoman court resting still within the city of Constantinople, which is now almost certainly eternally lost to the Turkish people now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTPOPTA00349;This couldn't possibly reverse our fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00350;The Janissaries Reinstated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00350;The Janissaries, those that placed the Sultan in power, may have expected initially that they would be awarded for their actions with prestigious positions in the new government, and a renewal of their rights and priviliges as existed before the Great Purge in the 20s. In return for their efforts, however, the Sultan instigated a series of military reforms of the empire, designed to bring it up to par with Western militaries despite its greatly reduced size. The Janissaries are indeed given positions in this military structure, but no longer as the armed combatants in separate roles they had once enjoyed. Rather, they form a new officer corps, serving to train and lead the standard armies of the empire in battle, trained in modern schools of warfare, ofen by foreign emissaries invited into the realm. As a depoliticized class, they no longer have the power to threaten the empire's integrity, but their desire for reward has been satiated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00350;Intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00351;Central Anatolian Population Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00351;The Sultan that has come to power has followed up his successful military reforms with comprehensive reforms of the state and social structure. One major factor of his efforts has been land reform. Particularly, he has engaged in efforts to grant plots of land and housing to those refugees that have fled from the Balkan territories of the empire, and has engaged in highly pro-natalist policies in order to recover the vastly diminished popualtion of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00351;The population will recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00352;Rumi Administrative Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00352;The Rumi Sultan has engaged in further reforms of the administration, particularly aimed at increasing the efficiency of the realms straggling bureaucratic apparatus. By enlisting the aid of foreign legal experts, and staffing the intelligentsia of the realm with those well versed in education, the bureaucracy of this period is soon proving to be the envy of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00352;Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00353;The Ionian Islands Settlement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00353;The Ionian Islands are a chain of islands off the west coast of the mainland, inhabited almost entirely by fellow Rhomaion civilians. During the Napoleonic Wars, the islands were occupied by Britain in order to secure naval bases in the Mediterranean. However, with our empire falling into their very own sphere of influence, the continued British presence is proving rather unnecessary. We should forward a request to have the islands transferred back to us as a show of good will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00353;Send the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00354;The Hellenes Request the Ionian Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00354;In recent days since the self-proclaimed Rhomaion Empire fell under our protection, probing diplomatic feelers have been sent out, addressing the matter of the Ionian Islands. An island chain taken during the Napoleonic Wars, these territories posit little value to us, and releasing them into Hellene custody would be a great gesture of good will to the international community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00354;Hand the lands back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00354;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00355;The Ionian Settlement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00355;The British have graciously handed back the Ionian Island chain to us, after a short negotiations process. This will surely usher in an era of unprecedented cooperation between the Rhomaion people and the British crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00355;Huzzah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00356;The British Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00356;The British have refused us our rightful possessions in the Ionian Islands. There is little we can do without risking war against the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00356;The Islands are lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00357;The Ionian Islands Seized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00357;As relations between our realm and the Hellene empire have soured, increasingly fears arose that the station in the Ionian islands would be the target of hostile operations against the British Empire. However, not many expected the sheer audacity of the operation that they engaged in. Our stations in the region, ill-defended as they were, were quickly overrun by Greek forces, accompanied by sympathetic locals. While these territories are of little value to us, and recognizing this territorial change can cool relations, this will undoubtedly constitute a humiliation, even if we planned to abandon the territories anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00357;Abandon the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00357;Even if we cant reclaim them, this insult cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00358;The Patriarchate of Antioch;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00358;The Patriarchate of Antioch was long one of the main churches of the Orthodox creed, a piece of the Pentarchy that once governed all of Christianity as a united faith. The city fell to the Islamic invasions alongside the other parts of the pentarchy, but was the only city to ever be reclaimed, even if briefly, by the Rhomaion empire in years past. Now, the city passes once again into our hands, and an Orthodox patriarch now governs over the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00358;The city is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00359;The City of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00359;The City of Jerusalem was once a proud member of the Pentarchy, the body of churches that once governed the whole of the Christian world as one. The city wherein Jesus preached and the very same wherein he was unjustly crucified, the city holds a special place in the hearts of all true Christians. Taken by the Islamic Caliphate first amongst all of the holy cities, it has seen much war and death in various struggles to claim the holy city. Now, it passes once again into Rhomaion hands, where it belongs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00359;And may it never be lost again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00360;The City of Alexandria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00360;The City of Alexandria has long held a special place in the hearts of the Rhomaion people. Built by Alexander the Great in times immemorial, the city has been a center of Greek culture dating ever since, a major center of the Christian church, and indeed the heart and soul of the Empire it resided under. The city, until the construction of Constantinople, even served as the de facto capital of the eastern empire itself, a center of trade, commerce, and the latest piece of the Pentarchy restored to prominence under Imperial control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00360;The city of Alexander passes to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00361;The City of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00361;A dream that was once deemed impossible has come to fruition, in a manner none could have ever predicted to become reality. The city of Rome itself, long the capital of the Roman Empire that we have restored, and replaced by the city of Constantinople, the city was lost to us before even the Levant, but not to the Islamic Caliphate. The city and seat of the Papacy, the city of Rome yet still remains the seat of one of the Pentarchs, no matter how wayward its leadership was in past centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00361;Home at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00362;The Pentarchy Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00362;Something that never would have entered the wildest dreams of Rhomaion emperors since the days of Justinian himself. For the first time in centuries, all five seats of the ancient pentarchy of the Christian church have been reunited. While this may not heal the wounds in the faith that have opened for so long, but the authority of the Orthodox church and its role as the primary head of the Christian world cannot be disputed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00362;Reunited!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00363;The Rhomaion Provisional Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00363;The victory in the revolution was merely the first step in the long road to independence for the Rhomaion people. While victory against the external foes of the state has been achieved, the matter of internal divisions and threats from within is far from settled. The empire is at a crossroads, as the provisional government set up in past years to carry the nation through its revolution is coming to an end. There are many whose interests clash with one another as to what course the empire should take going forwards. This debate will have existential implications for the empire going forwards. Whose vision should the empire adhere to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00363;Kolokotronis of the Russian Faction, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00364;The Course of the Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00364;The nomination of Kolokotronis as the head of the Rhomaion state's future has cemented the role many in the west had already feared the independent state would take: a firm advocate of partnership with Russia, Kolokotronis has closely aligned the state with the interests of the Orthodox east, and alongside the aristocracy seeks to ensure the continuation of the age old alliance dating back to the middle ages. Already, Russian support is pouring in, and the gifts of many Russian nobility happy to see the restoration of a Roman empire to their south have bolstered our own economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00364;Orthodoxy Stands United!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00365;Alexander The Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00366;Kolokotronis, a firm advocate of monarchism, still remains less than amenable to the forgoing of his own political power to an upstart candidate whom could undo his efforts to unify and stabilize the new Rhomaion realm. As such, a candidate for the throne of the Rhomaion kingdom has been difficult to find amongst suitable Russian nobility, despite efforts to appease the benefactors of Constantinople. Ultimately, a decision was reached to place the young Nicholas Constantovich upon the throne. His rule is currently placed under a regency, headed of course by Kolokotronis, until such time as he comes of age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00366;May his reign be just, when it comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00367;The Coronation of Nicholas I Constantovich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00367;The day has finally come, wherein the king Nicholas will be crowned ruler of the Rhomaion Kingdom. Having come of age, and spending six months in preparation for the day he would finally be crowned, the king was crowned in front of a large crowd in front of the Hagia Sophia, to acclaim by the many Rhomaion people within its walls. Having insisted strongly that the affair be as prestigious and entertaining as possible, this coronation has come at the severe expense of the state, and it is reported that after his coronation he spent many hours courting with the various women of the capital, some of whom were married to prominent aristocrats of the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00367;He only just got crowned, he'll get over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00368;The HMS Marlborough;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00368;Ever since the Rhomaion Kingdom made clear its close ties to the Russian Empire, British ships have been closed off from the Bosporus strait, and the Mediterranean itself has been open to Russian warships. Britain, always keen on undoing this treaty, has apparently chosen that the best course of action is to flaunt its restrictions on their own fleet, keeping warships stationed near our waters. Today, the HMS Marlborough was fired upon after drawing too close to a coastal battery, and the British have swiftly responded with a demand to open the Bosporus to British warships and to close it off from Russia, a move which would effectively cut Rhomaion ties from its mother country.However, to refuse would be to potentially draw the ire of one of the largest powers on the planet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00368;We must give in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00368;They think us cowards?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00369;The Rhomaion Kingdom Closes the Straits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00369;Terrible news has arrived to St Petersburg: the Rhomaion kingdom, under pressure from the British, has closed the Turkish straits to Russian warships! Without taking action now, the Balkans could fall under British influence, barring Russia from overseas ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00369;We must intervene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00369;There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00370;The Greeks Stand Defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00370;Despite our threats, the Greek Empire refuses to acknowledge our supremacy of arms. Should we engage them in battle, the Russians will undoubtedly intervene. However, success could see the breakup of this upstart realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00370;Show them our strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00370;Put this matter aside for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00371;The End of Kolokotronis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00371;The program of the Rhomaion Kingdom set forth by Kolokotronis has been put to an end by the acts of foreigners and revolutionaries. The thread of his leadership has been severed and no more can be said for the future of this state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00371;Woe is Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00372;Nicholas the Scoundrel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00372;As the years drag on, Nicholas has increasingly taken on himself a reputation as a womanizer and a disastrous presence within the royal court. His constant womanizing, brash demeanor, and disrespect for court officials makes him a laughingstock on the world stage, and therefore makes us a shame on the world stage as well. Even marriage has not stopped him from having several public affairs, and yet he is unable to even secure a divorce to salvage what little dignity he has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00372;Maybe this was a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00373;Nicholas the Terrible;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00373;Nicholas grows ever more burdensome to the kingdom he is meant to rule. The man swings around his royal prerogative on a regular basis such as to secure his continued wasteful life, no matter how much it drains the kingdom's coffers. All whom question him are immediately removed from the court, moveements against his rule are put down with vicious severity, and he increasingly takes on the role of a despot unseen since the late terrible Ottoman sultans before him, and his health, both physical and mental, appears to be in rapid freefall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00373;Please spare us his stupidity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00374;Nicholas the Mad;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00374;As things could not possibly grow any worse for the Basileia Tos Rhomaion, the Tsar of this country has grown extensively ill. A madness has overtaken him as late, leading all of his worst impulses to rise to the surface, leaving him a rambling buffoon incapable of leadership. Even so, the power he wields has left the nation in horrid straits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00374;God save us, for no-one else can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00375;The Mad Heretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00375;The opposition of the church hierarchy to the rule of the Tsar has grown ever more apparent as his madness grows. Even the mad Tsar is not unaware of this, and as of late he has begun using his royal prerogative over the church to begin forcing alterations to doctrine, doubtlessly in a mad bout to further damage the church in the eyes of the public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00375;Banish all Icons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00375;War! War to all infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00375;The wolf is a saint!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD00375;Im makin waffles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00376;The Patriarch's Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00376;For long enough the patriarch suffered the madness of the king, for the church remained secure even with the wastefulness of the mad king. However, as the king's madness and paranoia grew, leading him to suspect treachery and treason wherever shadows crossed his path, he began to attempt to assert his royal prerogative upon the church that played such a crucial role in his administration. Using the extensive powers invested in the Orthodox Church, Neophytus VIII has maneuevered the court around the madman, leaving the Tsar finally and completely powerless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00376;Long Live the Church!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00377;The Tsar Institutionalized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00377;The Tsar's ill health of mind and body has grown increasingly apparent to even those closest to him. In time, it was his own son that saw to it the end of the mad king. Nicholas shall be interned in a small estate near Adrianople for the rest of his days, while the pieces are picked up from the mess he left behind by his progeny. The age of the mad Tsar is at an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00377;The sins of the father are not easily undone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00378;The Death of the Tsar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00378;Ultimately, no matter how powerful the Mad Tsar was in the state or in the church, there was one enemy he could never use his royal prerogative to combat, that of the ravages of time and disease. The cancer in his brain finally taking its toll, Nicholas breathed his last on this day. His son succeeds him, and it is only left in question whether he wishes to keep the reforms of his father in place, or undo the mad kings rule once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00378;Tyranny no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00378;Some of these reforms are useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
