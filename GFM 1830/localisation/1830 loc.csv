schomburgk_line_title;The Schomburgk Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgk_line_desc;Following the dissolution of Gran Colombia, its unsettled and remote eastern frontier in Essequibo has been left unorganized and unprotected. Following our acquisition of Guyana from the Dutch, we inherited a territorial dispute over Essequibo with Gran Colombia which disputed the former Spanish treaty. Thus we have legal justification to seize this patch of jungle without conflict. The Royal Geographical Society of London recommends we send Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk to explore the region and delineate a proper border with Venezuela, as his work on surveying the Virgin Island of Anegada was quite impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgkexplained;Abusing flimsy claims of inheritance of responsibilites from treaties between Spain and the Dutch, Great Britain has occupied Essequibo. With our recently nascent country barely posessing an army of note, there is nothing we can do to resist the Brits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORDEATH;After resigning from the presidency, Bolívar made his way to Cartagena de Indias to board a ship and settle down abroad. However, he rested in the Customs House of Santa Marta as his health made travel difficult. As his condition worsened, he needed a transfer to a quieter place and moved to a farm located in San Pedro Alejandrino on the outskirts of the city, where he entered the full care of his trusted family doctor. Initially optimistic, both he and his doctor eventually recognized the severity of the condition, leading to Bolívar writing his will and instructing his entourage how to proceed in the event of his death. \nAfter the passage of morning marked by an increasing decline of vital signs, the silence of the house's main hall, occupied by the aides, military leadership of the Patriot Army and Bolívar's closest friends, was interrupted by the words of his doctor inviting them to the next room to witness the great liberator's last moments. Surrounded by his entourage, and after a long but calm agony, Simón Bolívar died at 1 PM, 3 minutes and 55 seconds on Friday, December 17, 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORSLASTWORDS;'Colombians: You have witnessed my efforts to raise freedom where tyranny once reigned. I have worked with selflessness, abandoning my fortune and even my tranquility. I separated from command when I was persuaded that you distrusted my detachment. My enemies abused your credulity and they trampled on what is most sacred to me, my reputation and my love of freedom. I have been a victim of my persecutors, who have led me to the doors of the tomb. I forgive them. As I disappear from your midst, my affection tells me that I must make a manifestato of my last wishes. I do not aspire to any other glory than the consolidation of Colombia. All of you must work for the inestimable good of the Union: The people obeying the government to be free from anarchy, the ministers of the sanctuary directing their prayers to heaven, and the military using their sword to preserve the peace. Colombians! My last wishes are for the happiness of the country. If my death contributes to the end of the parties and the consolidation of the Union, I shall go to the grave in peace.'   -Simón Bolívar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_title;The Apulo Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_desc;Gran Colombia is doomed. Without Bolívar, no force is strong enough to hold it together. With Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama in open revolt, Perhaps it would be better to face the facts and abandon the dream rather than spill more blood. President Rafael Urdaneta cannot handle the situation and has called for a convention to put an end to Gran Colombia and create a new state with a new constitution to consolidate what remains of our once great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORRESIGNS;Since 1828, Simón Bólivar has attempted to keep Gran Colombia together by assuming dictatorial powers to deal with the emergencies at hand. He has finally seen that this course of action has kept the union together but divided it ever more severely. He has now arrived at the conclusion that it would be best for Gran Colombia if he, El Libertador, resigned and left the presidency to a less divisive person. This however creates ever more uncertainty. Gran Colombia has always had Bolívar at its helm, what will happen now that he has left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES;Led by traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence following the example of Venezuela and Ecuador. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived unlike those in Venezuela and Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSECEDES;Informed of the secession of Venezuela and Bolívar's death, the assembly of the district of the South has declared independence, founding the state of Ecuador. The departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are now under the supreme rule of Juan Jose Flores, the head of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASECEDES;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of hero of the wars against Spain, General José Antonio Páez who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata that occurred between 1826 and 1829. While the assembly's rhetoric was anti-Bolivarian from the start, once it had been informed of Bolívar's death, it took a turn for a worse. The assembly ultimately ceremoniously announced its independence from Gran Colombia as the state of Venezuela under the leadership of General Páez himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAQUESTION;General Tomás Herrera has lead a counterrevolt against Juan Eligio Alzuru to put an end to Panamanian independence and repatriate to Colombia. While his revolt is seeing a lot of success, he needs the support of the people. The question lies in their loyalty to Colombia. Will they work towards continued self-sovereignty or reintegration to Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS;Executed by General Tomás Hererra, Alzuru's revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope the same may occur in Venezuela or Ecuador, but those hopes are clearly in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

clm_const_1832_desc;Now that the situation has stabilized, the constitutional assembly has finished its deliberations and formulated a constitution. It establishes the seperation of powers, the responsibilities of public officials, the duty to protect the catholic church and the unitary form of government with decentralized local assemblies. Furthermore, it divides congress into an upper and lower house and sets its legislative terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADMIRABLECONGRESS;Simón Bolívar's years as dictator of Gran Colombia have done the union no good. His unquestioned reign has even been compared by many to that of the kings of Spain. Recognizing what is best for the union, he has called for a new constitutional assembly to create a constitution for Gran Colombia in a last-ditch effort to prevent its dissolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE;After much trial and tribulation, Gran Colombia is united once more. El Libertador can rest easy knowing that the Bolivarian legacy shall continue. However, now that the crisis of secession is averted, we must ask ourselves what lies in our future. How will we govern ourselves to ensure that Gran Colombia will survive and not collapse once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUKECZACABINDA;In 1827, our great navy built a naval base in Cabinda, being the only rightyfully owned territory outside of our homeland. The Europeans, wanting to limit our power, want to force us into giving them Cabinda, as it's in a strategic position in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERTHYRRISING;Some days ago riots started in the town of Merthyr Tydfil, north of Cardiff, and today there are already reports of it expanding into all Wales, being an all-out rebellion. It's the first time a red flag is seen in a workers' revolt, being a symbol of the workers. They protest against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment, and among the shouts were cries of "Caws a bara" (cheese and bread), "Annibyniaeth" (independence) and "I lawr â'r Brenin" (down with the king), being a clear threat to the monarchy. Do we give them more rights or we protect the monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWYORKSECONDFIRE;On a night in 1835, a fire broke out in a five-story warehouse at 25 Merchant Street, at the intersection of Hanover Street. As it spread, gale-force winds blowing from the northwest towards the East River spread the fire. It could be seen from Philadelphia, approximately 80 miles away. At the time of the fire, major water sources were frozen in temperatures as low as -17 ºF, forcing the firefighters to drill holes to access liquid water, which later refroze around the houses and pipes. Efforts were made to deprive the fire of fuel by demolishing surrounding buildings, but there was insufficient gunpowder. Later in the next evening, a detachment of U.S. Marines returned with gunpowder and stopped the fire. During the day and a half that it burned, the fire killed 2 civilians and in total destroyed 660 buildings, resulting in property damage estimated between 20-25 million.

(We swear we will be free as were our sires, and sooner die than live in slavery). The news are already expanding to nearby towns, and similar "nonpolitical county fairs" are starting to be planned in other parts of the Palatinate, expanding Pan-German ideas to the population, being a threat to our independence and our policies in the topic.

HAMBACHFEST2;A week ago a suposedly nonpolitical county fair, which became a public demonstration in support of German unity, freedom and democracy, was celebrated at Hambach Castle, near Neustadt an der Weinstraße, in the Bavarian Palatinate, being provoked by liberal intellectuals, which established a democratic association that collided with Bavaria's reactionary policies.

EVTDESC127854;3 days ago Nat Turner, an enslaved African-American preacher, had organizad a rebellion of enslaved and free Black people in Southampton County, Virginia. Turner was recorded as "Nat" by Benjamin Turner, the man who enslaved him and his family. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, under then-current laws which made slavery legal, Nat was inherited as property by Benjamin's son Samuel Turner. On February 12, 1831, he witnessed a solar eclipse that was visible from much of the southeastern United States, and was convinced that it was the sign for which he was waiting. He began preparations for an uprising against the enslavers in Southampton County by purchasing muskets. The last 3 days they have been waging terror in Southampton, but have been stopped today by local militias and detachments of men from the USS Natchez and USS Warren. Approximately 120 black people died today, and around 60 white people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC127855;Turner eluded capture for six weeks, but remained in Southampton County. On October 30, a White farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people, in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. While awaiting trial, Turner confessed his knowledge of the rebellion to attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray, who compiled what he claimed was Turner's confession. Today he got sentenced to death and hanged for "conspiring to rebel and making insurrection".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
