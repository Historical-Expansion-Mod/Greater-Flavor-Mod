schomburgk_line_title;The Schomburgk Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgk_line_desc;Following the dissolution of Gran Colombia, its unsettled and remote eastern frontier in Essequibo has been left unorganized and unprotected. Following our acquisition of Guyana from the Dutch, we inherited a territorial dispute over Essequibo with Gran Colombia which disputed the former Spanish treaty. Thus we have legal justification to seize this patch of jungle without conflict. The Royal Geographical Society of London recommends we send Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk to explore the region and delineate a proper border with Venezuela, as his work on surveying the Virgin Island of Anegada was quite impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgkexplained;Abusing flimsy claims of inheritance of responsibilites from treaties between Spain and the Dutch, Great Britain has occupied Essequibo. With our recently nascent country barely posessing an army of note, there is nothing we can do to resist the Brits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORDEATH;After resigning from the presidency, Bolívar made his way to Cartagena de Indias to board a ship and settle down abroad. However, he rested in the Customs House of Santa Marta as his health made travel difficult. As his condition worsened, he needed a transfer to a quieter place and moved to a farm located in San Pedro Alejandrino on the outskirts of the city, where he entered the full care of his trusted family doctor. Initially optimistic, both he and his doctor eventually recognized the severity of the condition, leading to Bolívar writing his will and instructing his entourage how to proceed in the event of his death. \nAfter the passage of morning marked by an increasing decline of vital signs, the silence of the house's main hall, occupied by the aides, military leadership of the Patriot Army and Bolívar's closest friends, was interrupted by the words of his doctor inviting them to the next room to witness the great liberator's last moments. Surrounded by his entourage, and after a long but calm agony, Simón Bolívar died at 1 PM, 3 minutes and 55 seconds on Friday, December 17, 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORSLASTWORDS;'Colombians: You have witnessed my efforts to raise freedom where tyranny once reigned. I have worked with selflessness, abandoning my fortune and even my tranquility. I separated from command when I was persuaded that you distrusted my detachment. My enemies abused your credulity and they trampled on what is most sacred to me, my reputation and my love of freedom. I have been a victim of my persecutors, who have led me to the doors of the tomb. I forgive them. As I disappear from your midst, my affection tells me that I must make a manifestato of my last wishes. I do not aspire to any other glory than the consolidation of Colombia. All of you must work for the inestimable good of the Union: The people obeying the government to be free from anarchy, the ministers of the sanctuary directing their prayers to heaven, and the military using their sword to preserve the peace. Colombians! My last wishes are for the happiness of the country. If my death contributes to the end of the parties and the consolidation of the Union, I shall go to the grave in peace.'   -Simón Bolívar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_title;The Apulo Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_desc;Gran Colombia is doomed. Without Bolívar, no force is strong enough to hold it together. With Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama in open revolt, Perhaps it would be better to face the facts and abandon the dream rather than spill more blood. President Rafael Urdaneta cannot handle the situation and has called for a convention to put an end to Gran Colombia and create a new state with a new constitution to consolidate what remains of our once great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORRESIGNS;Since 1828, Simón Bolívar has attempted to keep Gran Colombia together by assuming dictatorial powers to deal with the emergencies at hand. He has finally seen that this course of action has kept the union together but divided it ever more severely. He has now arrived at the conclusion that it would be best for Gran Colombia if he, El Libertador, resigned and left the presidency to a less divisive person. This however creates ever more uncertainty. Gran Colombia has always had Bolívar at its helm, what will happen now that he has left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES;Led by traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence following the example of Venezuela and Ecuador. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived unlike those in Venezuela and Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSECEDES;Informed of the secession of Venezuela and Bolívar's death, the assembly of the district of the South has declared independence, founding the state of Ecuador. The departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are now under the supreme rule of Juan Jose Flores, the head of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASECEDES;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of hero of the wars against Spain, General José Antonio Páez who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata that occurred between 1826 and 1829. While the assembly's rhetoric was anti-Bolivarian from the start, once it had been informed of Bolívar's death, it took a turn for a worse. The assembly ultimately ceremoniously announced its independence from Gran Colombia as the state of Venezuela under the leadership of General Páez himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAQUESTION;General Tomás Herrera has lead a counterrevolt against Juan Eligio Alzuru to put an end to Panamanian independence and repatriate to Colombia. While his revolt is seeing a lot of success, he needs the support of the people. The question lies in their loyalty to Colombia. Will they work towards continued self-sovereignty or reintegration to Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS;Executed by General Tomás Hererra, Alzuru's revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope the same may occur in Venezuela or Ecuador, but those hopes are clearly in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It establishes the seperation of powers, the responsibilities of public officials, the duty to protect the catholic church and the unitary form of government with decentralized local assemblies. Furthermore, it divides congress into an upper and lower house and sets its legislative terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADMIRABLECONGRESS;Simón Bolívar's years as dictator of Gran Colombia have done the union no good. His unquestioned reign has even been compared by many to that of the kings of Spain. Recognizing what is best for the union, he has called for a new constitutional assembly to create a constitution for Gran Colombia in a last-ditch effort to prevent its dissolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE;After much trial and tribulation, Gran Colombia is united once more. El Libertador can rest easy knowing that the Bolivarian legacy shall continue. However, now that the crisis of secession is averted, we must ask ourselves what lies in our future. How will we govern ourselves to ensure that Gran Colombia will survive and not collapse once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUKECZACABINDA;In 1827, our great navy built a naval base in Cabinda, being the only rightyfully owned territory outside of our homeland.

MERTHYRRISING;Some days ago riots started in the town of Merthyr Tydfil, north of Cardiff, and today there are already reports of it expanding into all Wales, being an all-out rebellion. It's the first time a red flag is seen in a workers' revolt, being a symbol of the workers. They protest against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment, and among the shouts were cries of "Caws a bara" (cheese and bread), "Annibyniaeth" (independence) and "I lawr gyda'r Brenin" (down with the king), being a clear threat to the monarchy. Do we give them more rights or we protect the monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWYORKSECONDFIRE;On a night in 1835, a fire broke out in a five-story warehouse at 25 Merchant Street, at the intersection of Hanover Street. As it spread, gale-force winds blowing from the northwest towards the East River spread the fire. It could be seen from Philadelphia, approximately 80 miles away. At the time of the fire, major water sources were frozen in temperatures as low as -17°F, forcing the firefighters to drill holes to access liquid water, which later refroze around the houses and pipes. Efforts were made to deprive the fire of fuel by demolishing surrounding buildings, but there was insufficient gunpowder. Later in the next evening, a detachment of U.S. Marines returned with gunpowder and stopped the fire. During the day and a half that it burned, the fire killed 2 civilians and in total destroyed 660 buildings, resulting in property damage estimated between 20-25 million.

EVTDESC127854;3 days ago Nat Turner, an enslaved African-American preacher, had organizad a rebellion of enslaved and free Black people in Southampton County, Virginia. Turner was recorded as "Nat" by Benjamin Turner, the man who enslaved him and his family. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, under then-current laws which made slavery legal, Nat was inherited as property by Benjamin's son Samuel Turner. On February 12, 1831, he witnessed a solar eclipse that was visible from much of the southeastern United States, and was convinced that it was the sign for which he was waiting. He began preparations for an uprising against the enslavers in Southampton County by purchasing muskets. The last 3 days they have been waging terror in Southampton, but have been stopped today by local militias and detachments of men from the USS Natchez and USS Warren. Approximately 120 black people died today, and around 60 white people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC127855;Turner eluded capture for six weeks, but remained in Southampton County. On October 30, a White farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people, in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. While awaiting trial, Turner confessed his knowledge of the rebellion to attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray, who compiled what he claimed was Turner's confession.

EVTDESC16051840;In the rural town of Uster, Zürich canton, locals gathered today in a peaceful assembly to protest the overrepresentation of the cantonal capital compared to Zürich's rural parts. They argue that Uster's livelihood has been neglected, causing its locals to languish in poverty and remain largely uneducated. They also call for a new constitution to overhaul the governance of all Switzerland's cantons. For citizens to call for the constitution's repeal or amendment is unheard of: they are legally prohibited from petitioning the government to make such changes. Neverless, the liberal ideas left behind by Napoleon's rule clearly are still showing their influence. This will definitely not be the last call by our people for fair representation.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
EVTDESC16051841;Never before have our people made such strong demands against our government while also not shedding a drop of blood.

They demonstrated their resolve by organizing themselves into militias. Despite clashes across Freiamt where about 6,000 total militia members confronted Swiss forces--with both sides prepared to engage--not a single shot was fired. Miraculously, the government agreed to a revision to the constitution and negotiated an end to the uprising. This marks an indelible end to the illiberal, undemocratic government before Napoleon's time, where the government could get away with unequal or unfair representation of the people. Aargau was ruled particularly heavy-handedly by governor Johannes Herzog, who has been claimed to want to run a duchy instead of a canton. Well, his tyranny ends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When they arrived, the beys were greeted by a military procession--but the next thing they knew, upon a hand signal from Mehmed, the Turkish soldiers opened fire on the beys and killed them all. \n\nThe Ottomans have removed the one element in the government we could count on to stop our full annexation. Lest we let our dream of an independent Albania die out, we must rally our people and declare a war for our liberation against the Ottomans--right now.

CONCEPCIONEARTHQUAKE;A devastating earthquake has hit Concepción and nearby Talcahuano today at 11:30 AM. The quake combined with a resulting tsunami have left Concepción destroyed, with most buildings in ruins. Miraculously, though, casualties have remained low, with only 50 people reported dead. The lack of deaths is attributable to how the quake was slow to intensify and happened at about high noon, allowing locals to get to safety in time. Charles Darwin happened to be in Concepción as the earthquake struck, on a stop for the second voyage of the HMS Beagle. He would describe the quake as such: "I happened to be on shore, and was lying down in the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly, and lasted two minutes, but the time appeared much longer. The rocking of the ground was very sensible . . . The people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm. It is these accompaniments that create that perfect horror of earthquakes, experienced by all who have thus seen, as well as felt, their effects.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The barrage killed 18 people but only minorly wounded Louis-Philippe, and Fieschi was immediately captured. \n\nIt has since then been discovered that four barrels of the volley gun did not fire due to the components' failure. Surely more would have died, including the King, had the weapon worked as intended. Fieschi is imprisoned and awaiting trial, while Pépin and Morey are still at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We have since then expanded our army and begun waging war on neighboring principalities, hoping to become the dominant Kurdish tribe. But now, we have gone a bridge too far for the Ottomans--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of the Emirate of Bohtan, which is a Turk vassal. This can only end badly. . .;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZAKHOISBOHTAN;The Emirate of Soran was established in 1399 and subjugated by us in 1554. It stayed our peacable vassal for several centuries until the ambitious Mir Mohammed proclaimed himself "Emir Mansur"--an independent ruler. He has since then expanded his army and begun waging war on neighboring principalities, hoping for Soran to become the dominant Kurdish tribe. But now, he has gone a bridge too far--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of our vassal the Emirate of Bohtan. Something must be done to stop Soran's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

soran_je_ottoman_desc;While the Emirate of Soran has been driven back, the Emir still poses a threat to the region's stability. Letting his rule continue despite his rebellious actions may inspire other Kurdish chiefs to do the same. While the last expedition retook Soran's conquests but had to turn back shortly before the capital, Rewanduz, due to bad wheather, this second attack is sure to put an end to the dangerous Emir once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

fund_french_settlement_in_algeria_desc;Although our New World colonies are gone, our settler-colonial ventures are not yet over, still going strong in Algeria. But more often than not, these settlers will need a considerable amount of funding to ensure their livelihood in the new land. Thus, as the mother nation, it is seen as our duty to provide for their needs. The question is how much money we shall offer them, if at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGADEADAF;With our newfound victory over the Algerians, we must continue the fight against the tribesman who are holding out, rallying in the hinterland against colonial rule. No one must be left alive to resist French rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCETROLLED;France has pathetically attempted to conquer our great nation, and they have failed, as they had failed in Egypt in 1800, Haiti in 1804, and Russia in 1812. It is time to choose to either move forward as an independent nation or reapproach the Ottoman Empire for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANDOURENA;It is time to decide our policy of on the new settlers in Algeria and what they shall recive from the French state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUZCUOGLUREVOLTS;A rebellion has risen within the Sanjak of Lazistan, resisting the installment of derebeys--local governors--who are cruel and care most about consolidating Ottoman control. This comes as a result of a blood feud between the Hazinedaroglu and Tuzcuoglu families, both of whom have vied for control of Lazistan as derebeys. Derebey Adjara Osman Hazinedaroglu has used his authority to levy large taxes on his subjects, which contributed to food scarcity in 1829 and 1830. Locals have now begun to stop paying taxes and rebel, with rival Derebey Tahir Aga Tuzcuoglu as their leader. We cannot allow Tuzcuoglu to continue his defiance. We must put an end to the rabble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUZCUOGLUCRUSHED;Lazistan has been pacified and plundered by our army. With the Tuzcuoglu family removed from power, we can tighten our grip on the province and ensure its governors will be unconditionally loyal to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

uruguay_const_1830_title;The Uruguayan Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
uruguay_const_1830_desc;Inspired by the liberal ideas of the American and French revolutionaries, calls for a constitution firmly establishing Uruguay as a representative democracy are echoing within the government. Under this constitution, Uruguay will be represented by a president and a two-chamber legislative branch consisting of the Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Senators. Meanwhile, supreme legal power will be put in the hands of the Supreme Court of Justice. The constitution will also strengthen the federal government's authority--so much so that our country will be considered a unitary republic. Nevertheless, the constitution's passing will be a firm, welcomed step in the direction toward equality and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_title;The Anglo-Ashanti Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_desc;Border conflicts with the Ashanti Empire have been a constant occurrence since we first established our colony on the Gold Coast. With it obvious, though, that the Ashanti cannot fully repel our troops and retake that land, perhaps we should send them an ultimatum. We shall force an agreement that our borders will lie on the opposite banks of the Pra River, the natural boundary of the Gold Coast colony. Of course, there's nothing stopping us from eventually breaking this treaty and conquering them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romania_semiconst_1831_title;The Regulamentul Organic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romania_semiconst_1831_desc;While the Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moladvia are Ottoman vassals, we have retained garrisons in them since the war of 1828-29. The populace is becoming increasingly resentful of this, especially as we have confiscated Wallachia and Moldavia's treasuries for the time being. It is up to us to shape their governments for the better and hand them back control over their finances. The proposed Organic Regulation would form the organic law, or legal system forming the basis of government, of the principalities. It would establish a national assembly in Iasi and Bucharest elected by no more than 3000 of the most influential citizens. Furthermore, the Organic Regulation would, among other things, ensure the independence of the judiciary and establish a poll tax in place of the old indirect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REGULAMENTULORGANIC;Russia has imposed a legal system forming the basis of government on us:  the so-called Regulamentul Organic, or "Organic Regulation." This semi-constitutional document returns to us the Russian-confiscated treasury, establishes a national assembly elected by the three thousand most influential citizens, ensures the independence of the judiciary and replaces the old indirect taxes with a poll tax among many other reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REFORMISTREVOLUTION;The government of José María Vargas has become opposed by a growing movement for the restoration of Gran Colombia. The rebels are led by heroes of the war of independence, including Santiago Mariño, Diego Ibarra and José Laurencio Silva, all formerly loyalists to the bolivarian cause. They have rallied their forces in the city of Maracaibo and begun marching East to take Caracas. Now, in turn, José Antonio Páez, the man who split Venezuela from Gran Colombia and spelled its doom has returned from retirement and assembled militia to join the struggle on the government's side. It seems that the old rivalry between proponents and detractors of Gran Colombia is to play out one final time--on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_title;The Peruvian Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_desc;Now that the Bermudists have been defeated, we can finally set about finishing the new constitution. The proposed draft mostly reiterates the 1828 constitution and follows its liberal spirit but makes some adjustments to combat instability which has been experienced since. For example, the post of vice-president would be removed due to the bad contact of former VP Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente. Another example is the prohibition of immediate presidential reelection, a tactic used by Augustín Gamarra to elongate his presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCONGRESSPRU;The 1828 Constitution had agreed that in 1833, five years later, a new constitution would be formulated to adapt to the new situation of our country and possibly implement a federal system. Thus, a constitutional congress has gathered and heald a vote to elect a provisional president until the new constitution is finished. Pretenders for the position were the liberal Luis José de Obregoso, the conservative Pedro Pablo Bermúdez and the independent Domingo Nieto. Obregoso won with 47 votes to Bermúdez's 36 and Nieto's 1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCIVILWAR;Pedro Pablo Bermúdez has rejected the result of the constitutional convention's election of José de Obregoso and risen up in revolt, beginning a civil war. While Bermúdez enjoys the support of most of the army, the populace of Lima and Arequipa are on the side of Obregoso, forcing Bermudist troops to retreat from the cities, unable to capture them with the adamant opposition of the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

belgium_const_1831_title;The Belgian Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
belgium_const_1831_desc;Belgium's existence is extraordinary, considering how divided along linguistic and cultural lines our two major ethnic groups are. Nevertheless, it is our duty to consolidate our brand-new nation, uniting the Flemish, the Walloons and the small German minority. We shall create a constitutional monarchy, a compromise between liberals and the conservatives. The state will have three branches of government and afford privileges to the Catholic Church. Basic freedoms such as that of expression, worship, and the press will be guaranteed. However, only landed subjects will be able to vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANANTHEM;La Brabançonne, the song that has become a rallying cry and source of Belgian nationalism, was not, in fact, been written by a Belgian. A French mercenary serving in Brussels, known by the alias Jenneval, composed the original poem the song is based on before dying in action. The title refers to inhabitants of the region of Brabant, where Brussels is located. The poem originally scolded rioters during the revolution and claimed the Dutch Prince of Orange would be the "example of kings" and "father of Belgians" if he granted Belgium independence. However, following the bombardment of Antwerp, he wrote a second version condemning the Dutch for their brutality. An arrangement with the second version's lyrics, set by François van Campenhout to the tune of "L'Air des lancers polonais" ("Song of the Polish Lancers"), has immediately gained popularity among our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKING;Although our constitution declares us a constitutional monarchy, as of yet we lack a monarch. Three options have been debated: Firstly, the Duke of Nemours, son of revolutionary king Louis-Philippe of France. Secondly, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a member of the British royal house. Thirdly, a minor noble. The French candidate, while ensuring French protection would surely be concerning to the UK and Prussia who would see it as an increase in revolutionary influence in Europe. On the other hand, the British candidate would probably have some strings attached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRANCE;Belgium has sent us an emissary to propose the coronation of the Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe as king of Belgium. While this would give us much influence over Belgium, it would surely attract the ire of the British and Prussians. Additionally, Belgium's industry, which is larger than ours, would, by increased interaction with our economy, hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRBEL;King Louis-Philippe has given the go-ahead to the coronation of the Duke of Nemours. Celebrations have begun amid his arrival in Brussels. Belgium finally has a king, and a popular one at that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSABONKFR;The Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe of France, has been crowned king of Belgium at the bequest of the provisional government. This act spreads the influence of the French revolution further throughout Europe and endangers the old order. With the Louis-Philippe's son on the throne, Belgium is now a French protectorate in all but name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNO;Louis-Philippe has refused to let his son become king of France. The reason he gives for this is twofold: On the one hand, he does not wish to raise the ire of the other European powers, specifically Prussia and the UK, by extending his influence. On the other hand, Belgium's industry far outmatches France's and economic intermingling between the two would hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGBRIISH;Belgium has sent us an emissary proposing the coronation of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as their king. While it would definitely increase our influence on Belgium, we would get mixed up in their ongoing conflict with the Dutch. An agreement called the "Treaty of the Eighteen Articles" has been proposed which would agree to the coronation of Leopold under the condition that the matters of Limburg and Luxembourg are for Britain to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNOBLE;The British have outright refused to let Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha become our king, wanting to have nothing to do with our revolutionary state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGENGYES;The British have given the OK to the coronation of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. He has already arrived in Brussels amid much jubilation. Belgium finally has a king, and a popular one at that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMAKINGENGTROLL;The British have agreed to have Leopold be crowned king of Belgium. However, they have demanded that we first sign the so-called "Treaty of the Eighteen Articles." This document would give Britain ultimate authority to decide the fate of Limburg and Luxembourg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMAKINGENGTROLLNO;Belgium has agreed to sign the Treaty of the Eighteen Articles in faith that we will make a fair judgement over the issue of Limburg and Luxembourg. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will, after all, be king of Belgium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMAKINGENGTROLLYES;Belgium has refused to sign the Treaty of the Eighteen Articles, for they lack faith that we will make a fair judgement over the issue of Limburg and Luxembourg. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will not, after all, be king of Belgium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMINDEPENDENCE;Rebel leaders have formed a provisional government to cooperate and organize the revolt into a formidable united force. Today, they have finally declared the independence of "Belgium," a Catholic state encompassing Luxembourg, Wallonia, Flanders and Limburg. All these lands are, aside from a few forts still held by our troops, in the hands of the rebels. They have already begun reaching out to other European powers in pursuit of recognition. After the disaster in the September Days, our army is in too much disarray to fight. Our only option is biding our time and invading once we have built up our strength and licked our wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEPTEMBERDAYS;A force of 12,000 soldiers under the leadership of Prince Frederick marched into Brussels, determined to restore order. Yet they were completely unprepared for the challenge they faced: seemingly every inhabitant is on the side of the rebellion. The soldiers were embattled from all sides and constantly under fire. The raw ferocity and determination of the populace brought the organized army to its knees, unable to hold in face of such opposition. After four days of fighting, they were routed and fled North in disarray. This humiliating defeat has solidified the rebels' position and cast doubt on whether we shall ever be able to retake the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRUSSELSRIOTS;Tensions have long been rising in our Catholic southern provinces due to grievances, including but not limited to the following: underrepresentation of Catholics in the General Assembly, the south having to pay for the larger debt of the north, Protestant domination of government ministries, and inadequate freedoms of press and assembly. With news of the successful recent revolution in France, the situation has escalated. A large group of opera-goers began rioting in the streets after attending The Mute Girl of Portici, a sentimental and patriotic opera set during an Italian 17th-century uprising against Spanish rule. Droves of inhabitants joined the mob, which proceeded to storm government offices. Now, a day later, the mayhem has only worsened, spreading across the south and driving our forces into retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANENG;France has proposed that we partition Belgium instead of recognizing it. We would receive Ghent and Antwerp, while France would get Wallonia and Brussels, Prussia would be given Luxemburg and Liège, and the Dutch would receive Limburg and Hasselt. Antwerp's port would be the most likely to be used to launch an invasion of our isles with its large, close port. Thus, its control would be immensely beneficial to our defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANPRU;France has proposed that we partition Belgium instead of recognizing it. We would receive Luxemburg and Liège, while France would get Wallonia and Brussels, the UK would be given Ghent and Antwerp, and the Dutch would receive Limburg and Hasselt. Luxemburg and Liège have a large German population that would gladly join us in the future pursuit of German unification. The area is also rich in coal and iron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANFAILS;Other powers in Europe have refused to agree to the Flahaut plan, denouncing it as unjust to the Belgian cause and unfairly imbalanced to favor us. Thus, without support of the others, the plan cannot go ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANSUCCEEDS;With the other powers enthusiastically agreeing, Belgium is soon to be no more. As they have no chance against our combined might, the partition is already proceeding without opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANSUCCEEDSBEL;France, the UK, Prussia and the Netherlands have agreed to partition us in the so-called Flahaut Plan. Faced with the might of all Western European great powers working together, we have no choice but to surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANSUCCEEDSNET;France, the UK and Prussia have worked out a deal to partition Belgium in the so-called Flahaut Plan. Faced with the might of all Western European great powers working together, Belgium has no choice but to surrender. We will receive Limburg and Hasselt--a fraction of the territory lost, but still better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
flauhaut_plan_title;The Flahaut Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
flauhaut_plan_desc;Belgium has no right to exist. Its people speak Dutch, French and German, an amalgamation utterly undeserving of a nation-state of its own. Therefore, it would be best to divide its lands. With us receiving Wallonia and Brussels, Prussia getting Luxembourg and Liège, the UK being given Antwerp and Ghent, and the Netherlands receiving Limburg and Hasselt, the Western European great powers would surely all be on board.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSAMQUESTION;The Assamese kingdom of Kachari was assisted by British forces in its liberation from Burmese occupation in the Anglo-Burmese War. It makes up part of the larger region of Assam, a strip of land above Bengal comprising the fertile Brahmaputra river valley. The previous king of Kachari, Govinda Chandra Hasnu, has died and is succeeded by an heir friendly to British interests. This heir, Senapati Tularam Thaosen, is willing to give up the throne in exchange for British protection--allowing us to annex Kachari into the East India Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;
assam_puppetted_title;Puppet Assam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
assam_puppetted_desc;We would love nothing more than to control all of Assam for its rich farmland and the expansion of Britain's markets in India. The locals, however, do not easily consent to foreign rule. There is a way around this: we could restore native autonomy in the region by installing a king as tributary. The king we have in mind is Purandar Singha, a prince of the Ahom Kingdom. Under our plan, he will be installed as a ruler in Upper Assam, guaranteeing our undisputed dominance in the region without directly governing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;
