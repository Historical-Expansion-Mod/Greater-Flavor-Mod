EVTNAME99900;The Singapore Free Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99900;The Free Port of Singapore. Due to it's strategic position in the Straits of Johore, Singapore grew to become one of the most important ports in the world. In 1834, the British government ended the East India Company's monopoly on the China trade, allowing other British companies to enter the market and leading to a surge in shipping, as a result Singapore became an important coaling station for steam shipping networks that were beginning to form in the 1840s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99901;Poverty in China due to the Opium Wars sparked many Chinese to seek better lives in Singapore,"These Chinese coolies formed the early backbone of Singapore's labour force, engaged mainly in hard physical labour. Their cheap labour in Singapore's mines, ports, construction sites, plantations and jungles contributed greatly to the island's growth. The word “coolie” is believed to have come from the Hindi term kuli, which is also the name of a native tribe of Gujerat in western India. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99907;"It is with much grief that I feel myself obliged to communicate to your Excellency a dreadful event which has happened to me, and as an English subject to beg your protection. Last Sunday, Easter-day, at about 12 o'clock, a crowd of people, presented themselves at the door of my house, which they very soon battered down. These brigands, in number about 300 or 400, entered my house, and began beating my wife and my innocent children.

EVTDESC99909;"I have desired the Admiralty to instruct Sir William Parker to take Athens on his way back from the Dardanelles, and to support you in bringing at last to a satisfactory ending the settlement of our various claims upon the Greek Government. If however, the Greek Government does not strike, Parker must do so. In that case you should embark on board his fleet before he begins to take any hostile steps, in order that you and your mission may be secure against insult. He should, of course, begin by reprisals, that is, by taking possession of some Greek property, but the King would probably not much care for our taking hold of any merchant property, and the best thing, therefore, would be to seize hold of his little fleet, if that can be done handily. The next thing would be a blockade of any or all of his ports...." - Lord Palmerston, Foreign Secretary;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME99930;Splendid Isolation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99930;It is the duty of the Government of this country, placed as it is with regard to geographical position, to keep itself upon terms of goodwill with all surrounding nations, but not to entangle itself with any single or monopolising alliance with any one of them, above all to endeavour not to interfere needlessly and vexatiously with the internal affairs of any foreign country. - Lord Edward Stanley, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. \n\nThe policy of 'splendid isolation' was characterised by Britain's reluctance to enter into permanent European alliances or commitments with the other great powers. During the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT99928;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99928;In the 1850s, the cities of each colony began a period of dramatic change. This transformation was due to an increased population, wealth from the gold rushes in New South Wales and Victoria and new ideas generated by a culturally diverse population. By the end of the decade, public structures and housing in Sydney and Melbourne had multiplied. Many elegant and ornate civic buildings with attractive tree-lined and paved streetscapes were built. \n\nBetween 1851 and 1854, the population of Victoria grew from about 77,000 to more than 200,000. The estimated population of Australia in 1850 was approximately 400,000, but had increased to 1 million by 1860.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The first to hear confirmed information of the gold rush were the people in Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), and Latin America, and they were the first to start flocking to the state in late $YEAR$. \n\n All in all, the news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. Of the 300,000, approximately half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99935;In $YEAR$, Congress narrowly passed a bill that authorized the U.S. to annex the Republic of Texas if it so voted. The legislation set the date for annexation for the end of of the same year. A majority of voters in Texas approved a proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and the slave trade. This constitution was later accepted by the U.S. Congress, making Texas a state on the same day annexation took effect, therefore bypassing a territorial phase \n\n The Mexican government had long warned that annexation would mean war with the U.S. When Texas joined the U.S., the Mexican government broke diplomatic relations with the United States. The U.S. now assumed the claims of Texas when it claimed all land north of the Rio Grande. In $YEAR$ President James K. Polk sent General Zachary Taylor to Texas, soon 3,500 Americans were on the Nueces River, prepared to defend Texas from a Mexican invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99936;In the mid-to-late 19th century, the Chinese Qing Empire weakened substantially and became increasingly unable to support the Lanfang Republic as its vassal state. Thus, Lanfang Republic's vigorous development suffered from the eventual expansion of the Dutch. The Republic's citizenry waged a tenacious resistance, but ultimately failed due to poor weaponry. Many of Lanfang's citizens and their descendants made their way to Sumatra or Singapore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME99937;Georges Boulanger;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99937;Georges Ernest Jean-Marie Boulanger, nicknamed General Revanche, was a French officer who was noted for his bravery and leadership during the Franco-Prussian War and was among the leaders of the Third Republic who crushed the short-lived Paris Commune. \n\n With backing from his direct superior, Henri d'Orleans, duc d'Aumale (incidentally, one of the sons of former king Louis-Philippe), Boulanger was made a brigadier-general and in $YEAR$ was apppointed  director of infantry at the war office. His base of support and popularity comes from the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, however he was initially seen as a Republican. He is noted for an aggressive form of nationalism, known as Revanchism, which opposes The German Empire and calls for the defeat of the Franco-Prussian War to be avenged.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME99939;The Schnaebele Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99939;In $YEAR$, the French Havas news agency published a dispatch to the effect that Guillaume Schnaebele, a mid-level and obscure French police inspector, had been arrested by two agents of the German secret police on the Franco-German frontier near Pagny-sur-Moselle, as he was travelling for a meeting with the German police inspector there, at the latter's request. A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, under the circumstances Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n\n The reason given for the arrest was that in a previous inquiry, evidence had been produced that Schnaebele was involved in transmitting information as to German fortresses, furnished by Alsatians in the pay of the French Government, in other words, the Germans believe Schnaebelé to be a spy. \n\n What should the response of the French Government be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, the French claim Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n\n It is suspected by German officials that Schnaebelé had been spying on German border fortresses for the French Government, however the circumstances behind his arrest may put us in a negative light despite of the proofs of guilt. \n\n What should our response to the French be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT99940OPTA;It's just a meetinng between frontier officials, release him;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME99941;The Schnaebele Affair - Schnaebele is released!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99941;Within a week of his arrest, Schnaebelé was released by order of the German Emperor William I. Although the German Government considered, in view of the proofs of guilt, the arrest to be fully justified, it was deemed expedient to release Schnaebelé on the ground that business meetings between frontier officials "must always be regarded as protected by a mutually-assured safe conduct." \n\n Although many in France believe Bismarck backed down because he was afraid of Boulanger, the French Army is no better of than it was during the Franco-Prussian War. \n\n There is now question on what to do with Boulanger, with many within the government to have him sacked.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Bonapartists had attached themselves to the general, and even the Comte de Paris encouraged his followers to support him. Once seen as a republican, Boulanger shows his true colors in the camp of the conservative monarchists. In $MONTH$, $YEAR$ Boulanger was expelled from the army and the day after, Daniel Wilson had his imprisonment repealed. It seemed to the French people that honorable generals were punished while corrupt politicians were spared, further increasing Boulanger's popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99943;In the elections of $YEAR$, Boulanger ran as a deputy for Paris, and, after an intense campaign, took the seat with 244,000 votes against the 160,000 of his main adversary.

EVTDESC99944;Had Boulanger immediately placed himself at the head of a revolt he might have effected the coup which many of his partisans had worked for, and might even have governed France, but the opportunity passed with his procrastination on $MONTH$. According to Lady Randolph Churchill "all his thoughts were centered in and controlled by her who was the mainspring of his life. After the plebiscite...he rushed off to Madame Bonnemain's house and could not be found". \n\n Boulanger decided that it would be better to contest the general election and take power legally. This gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back, and activities of secret societies were soon forbidden and banned.\n\nShortly afterward the government issued a warrant for Boulanger's arrest for conspiracy and treasonable activity. To the astonishment of his supporters, he fled Paris before it could be executed, going first to Brussels and then to London.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Secondly, several coastal cities of China are still under our influence and control, and under the past treaties with the Qing, these ports have to remain open to foreign trade. \n\nNow the question is which course should we take - Extending our influence to the breakaway Chinese states, Seizing the coastal ports open to foreign trade, or make peace with the new Chinese Kingdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tewodros asked the British Consul, Captain Charles Duncan Cameron, to carry a letter to Queen Victoria requesting skilled workers to come to teach his subjects how to produce firearms, and other technical skills. \n\nOn Cameron's return, the Emperor became enraged when he found out that Cameron had not taken the letter to London personally and had not brought a response from the Queen. \n\nThe British sent a mission under Hormuzd Rassam, bearing a letter from the Queen. He did not bring the skilled workers as requested. Deeply insulted by the British failure to do exactly as they were told, Tewodros had the members of the Rassam mission imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC111004;In the conflict with the British, Tewodros' army was decisively defeated, many of his men began to desert and the emperor was left with only 4,000 soldiers. Tewodros II attempted to make peace. Napier responded with a message thanking him for this peace offering and stating that he would treat the Emperor and his family with every dignity. Tewodros II furiously responded that he would never be taken prisoner. \n\nThe British shelled Magdala, killing most of Tewodros II's remaining loyal men. Tewodros released all the European unharmed but ordered 300 Ethiopian prisoners to be flung over the cliff. The emperor committed suicide, as the British troops stormed the citadel of Magdala.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999951;In 1857, Liu Yongfu, a Hakka soldier of fortune, commanded a group of about 200 men within a larger bandit group in Guangxi province, which eventually came to be known as the Black Flag Army.

Hotly pursued, the desperate Wu Yazhong, with Liu and his Black Flag Army, crossed into Upper Tonkin in $YEAR$. \n\nLiu Yongfu soon established a profitable extortion network along the course of the Red River, "taxing" river commerce between Son Tây and Lào Cai at a rate of 10%.

As Puyi cried, screaming that he did not want to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City.
