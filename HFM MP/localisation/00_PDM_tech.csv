combine_harvesters;Steam-Powered Combine;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
combine_harvesters_desc;The Combine Harvester, or simply Combine, is a versatile machine designed to efficiently harvest a variety of grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate harvesting operations - reaping, threshing, and winnowing - into a single process. With the use of a steam engine in a combine harvester, the potential harvest of a single worker increases dramatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
nylon;Nylon;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
nylon_desc;Nylon was intended to be a synthetic replacement for silk and substituted for it in many different products after silk became scarce during World War II. It replaced silk in military applications such as parachutes and flak vests, and was used in many types of vehicle tires;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
portland_cement;Portland Cement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
portland_cement_desc;Portland cement is a type of cement made out of the basic ingredients of concrete, mortar, stucco and most non-specialty grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century, and usually originates from limestone. Its name is derived from its similarity to Portland stone which was quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
rosendale_cement;Rosendale Cement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
rosendale_cement_desc;Rosendale cement generally refers to a type of natural cement that was produced in and around Rosendale,New York from argillaceous limestone,but is a term that has had different definitions at different times. The fast-setting Rosendale natural cement mortars proved to be more efficient than the mortars based on lime and sand. Because of its reputation,"""Rosendale Cement"" has also been used as both a trade name and as a generic term referring to natural hydraulic cements produced elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
poudre_b;Poudre B;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
poudre_b_desc;Meaning 'poudre blanch' or 'white powder', Poudre B was the first practical smokeless gunpowder, three times more powerful than black powder for the same weight. Originally called "Poudre V", from the name of the inventor, Paul Vieille, it was arbitrarily renamed "Poudre B" (short for poudre blanche -- white powder, as distinguished from black powder) to distract foreign espionage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
freud;Sigmund Freud;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
freud_desc;Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist who founded the disciple of psychoanalysis. He is best known for his theories on the unconscious mind and the mechanism of repression, and for creating the clinical method of psychoanalysis for investigating the mind and treating psychpathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud established sexual drives as the primary motivational forces of human life, developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association, discovered the phenomenon of transference in the therapeutic relationship and established its central role in the analytic process.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
jung;Carl Jung;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
jung_desc;Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an influential thinker, and the founder of analytical psychology. Jung is often considered the first modern psychologist to state that the human psyche is 'by nature religious' and to explore it in depth. Those not the first to analyze dreams, he has become perhaps one of the most well-known pioneers in the field of dream analysis. Unlike Freud, he was a self-described natural scientist and not a theoretical psychologist. For Jung this salient distinction revolved around his initial process of deep observation followed by categorizations rather than the reverse process of imagining what categories exist and then proceeding to seek for proof of and then discover that one was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
david_ricardo;David Ricardo;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
david_ricardo_desc;David Ricardo was an English political economist who followed the theories of Adam Smith. He wrote his most important work in 1817, titled Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. A great promoter of free trade, his major contribution to classical economics was his Law of Comparative Advantage, where he argued that mutual advantage in trade was always possible if each country concentrated on its resource advantages.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
alexander_bain;Alexander Bain;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
alexander_bain_desc;An associate of J.S. Mill, Alexander Bain added connections from physiology to associationist psychology, adding the laws of compound and constructive association to those of contiguity, similarity, and frequency. He was known for writing two of the earliest textbooks in psychology in 1855 and 1859, which were used by later experimental psychologists such as William James. His Spencer-Bain principle concerning probability of behavior recalls the later Behaviorist school in its conclusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
thomas_brown;Thomas Brown;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
thomas_brown_desc;Thomas Brown was an associationist of the Scottish School, he added a secondary set of laws to complete the associationist philosophy. He built upon earlier work by broadening associationism to consider it as an active process of an active mind. This active process considered the effects of other associations, temperament and state of mind of the individual, the state of health of the body, as well as the circumstances of the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
francis_galton;Francis Galton;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
francis_galton_desc;Sir Francis Galton was a British aristocrat who wrote extensively on the measurement of an individual's mental abilities using sensory and motor tests. His 1869 work 'Hereditary Genius:  An Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences' argued that the children of geniuses tended to become geniuses themselves. He surveyed thousands of fellow academics, publishing in 1874 his findings that intelligence was primarily a heritable trait, although there was some necessity for environmental nurturance of that trait. He was the first to use identical and fraternal twins to measure the effects of nature versus nurture, and established in 1888 the theoretical basis for correlation, scatterplots, and regression as measurement tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
alfred_binet;Alfred Binet;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
alfred_binet_desc;Alfred Binet was a French psychologist who pioneered the use of standardized testing to measure individual differences in intelligence. The French government commissioned Binet and his student Theodore Simon to develop a test in 1899 to differentiate 'retarded' from 'normal' children. The Simon-Binet test divided intelligence into several areas and measured each with a battery of questions. Questions considered to measure higher ability were those answered more often by students whom their teachers had rated highly. Binet also believed that intelligences were inherited, but improvable by education. His test assigned a single 'mental-level' score to each subject based on their test results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
charles_spearman;Charles Spearman;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
charles_spearman_desc;Charles Spearman was a British psychologist and mathematician. Spearman criticized Galton's tests as being too simple to measure intelligence. He preferred Binet's test, but criticized the use of a universal number to characterize different areas of intelligence. He developed the process of factor analysis, measuring correlations between performance in different test areas. He proposed two underlying factors 'g' for general intelligence to explain the correlations and 's' for specific abilities to explain the imperfections in his correlations. His 'g' factor was not a concrete number, but he too believed in the heritability of intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
eugenics;Eugenics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
eugenics_desc;An outgrowth from Darwinistic ideas on natural selection and trait theories and from the studies in intelligence measurement, Eugenics was concerned with the mental and physical traits found in society and a response to the weaknesses found. Positive eugenics encouraged family programs, social welfare, and the importance of education in the desirability of breeding to increase the appearance of positive traits. Negative eugenics argued for the need to remove weak traits by removing undesirable elements, leading to sterilization and even extermination of target groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
wilhelm_wundt;Wilhelm Wundt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
wilhelm_wundt_desc;Wilhelm Wundt was a German physiologist who opened the first university-based psychological laborator in Leipzig in 1879. Wundt published the first textbook to identify psychology as a science. His 'two reaction-time' tasks demonstrated that complex sequences are the combination of more elementary processes. This was the foundation of Cognitive Psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
edward_titchener;Edward Titchener;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
edward_titchener_desc;Edward Titchener was an English psychologist who studied under Wundt at Leipzig. Titchener headed the psychology department at Cornell University and founded the Structuralist school, which relied heavily on introspection to perform analysis on the structure of the mind. His attempts to break down experiences into four basic elements was discredited because it was possible for different subjects to identify different elements from the same experiences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
william_james;William James;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
william_james_desc;William James was an American psychologist and philosopher at Harvard University. James emphasized the the study of the purposes and functions of the mind, rather than its structure. James is considered the founder of the Functionalist school. He used experiments and introspection, but disclaimed introspection as scientific proof.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
gs_hall;G. Stanley Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
gs_hall_desc;G. Stanley Hall was the first President of the American Psychological Association. Hall founded the American Journal of Psychology in 1887. His research focused on educational psychology and adolescence. He adapted the term 'Storm and Stress' to characterize the period of adolescence. Hall believed in the heritability of behavior and supported the Eugenics program. His views on child development were later largely refuted by Piaget and Vygotsky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
hermann_ebbinghaus;Hermann Ebbinghaus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
hermann_ebbinghaus_desc;Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist who pioneered studies in memory. Ebbinghaus used himself as subject in thousands of repetitions of his 'nonsense syllables.' Among his contributions to the field were the learning curve, the forgetting curve, and the serial position effect, which demonstrated that individuals remember the most recent information first presented. He documented 'savings': information relearned a second time is memorized faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
mary_calkins;Mary Calkins;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
mary_calkins_desc;Mary Calkins was an American teacher who became the first female President of the American Psychological Association. A student of James' in 1890, Calkins completed the requirements for a PhD at Harvard only to be refused. She went on to a distinguished tenure at Wellesley College, writing about the psychology of the self: 'a totality, a one of many characters... a unique being in the sense that I am I and you are you'....;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
alfred_adler;Alfred Adler;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
alfred_adler_desc;Alfred Adler was an Austrian doctor and psychtherapist. Adler diverged from Freud in arguing that unconscious motivation could be better explained by teleological goals rather than instinctual drives. According to Adler, people are born with a feeling of Inferiority. People attempt to overcome these feelings of inferiority. Adler posited one of three outcomes. An 'inferiority complex' develops in people who are overwhelmed by these feelings. Some of these will develop a superiority complex to mask their true feelings. Psychologically healthy people manifest the concept of self-esteem and satsify their goals through a sense of personal achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
anna_freud;Anna Freud;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
anna_freud_desc;The daughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna began her psychoanalytic practice in 1923. She served as secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association between 1925 and 1934. Freud became known for her work on the social importance of the ego in childhood development. She wrote 'Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense' (1936) in which she further developed the concept of defense mechanisms such as repression, displacement, reaction formation and rationalization. These are mental processes to reduce consciousness of wishes, memories and thoughts that prove threatening to self-esteem and security of the individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
karen_horney;Karen Horney;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
karen_horney_desc;Karen Horney was a German psychoanalyst. She came to criticize Freud's emphasis on sex and aggressive as motivating drives. Horney (1937) focused on security instead as the central, inborn human need. In her view, child development was contingent upon parental fulfillment of the child's 'basic anxiety' emotion. Success would result in a trusting individual, while failure would result in insecurity. Insecurity and distrust manifests itself in personality as either avoidance, submission or dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ivan_pavlov;Ivan Pavlov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ivan_pavlov_desc;Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist and winner of the Nobel Prize for his work on reflexes in digestion. In the course of studies with dogs and salivation, Pavlov observed that the dogs elicited a certain type of salivation with certain signals that preceeded the arrival of food. In his 1927 study, Pavlov laid out the basic principles of classical conditioning in Behaviorism. The food was the unconditioned stimulus for salivation. The signal became associated with salivation as a conditioned stimulus, with salivation to the sound of the signal alone becoming the new conditioned response. Extinction, recovery, generalization and discrimination were identified in subsequent studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
el_thorndike;Edward L. Thorndike;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
el_thorndike_desc;Edward Lee Thorndike was an American researcher who also conducted experiments in animal learning. He was known for his puzzle-box procedure (1898), in which a hungry cat was placed inside a small cage and observed to see how long it took the cat to learn to pull the lever and escape, where food was waiting. He observed that after 20-30 trials, the cats had become efficient at escaping almost instantaneously. Thorndike formulated the law of effect, stating that responses producing a positive effect became more likely to occur again, and those producing discomfort were less likely to occur again. These observations were later transformed by B.F. Skinner into the concept of operant conditioning in psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
jb_watson;John B. Watson;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
jb_watson_desc;John Broadus Watson was an American psychologist who studied Pavlovian conditioning in humans. Watson's most famous experiment involved conditioning an 11-year old child named Albert to associate a conditioned stimulus (fear of rats) to an unconditioned stimulus (fear of a loud hammering sound). Watson's research later led to clinical treatments extinguishing irrational fears in people. After being dismissed from Harvard over an affair and marriage with a graduate student, Watson brought his research experience to a prominent advertising firm. Modern advertising owed much to behaviorist psychology and conditioning concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
ec_tolman;Edward C. Tolman;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ec_tolman_desc;Edward C. Tolman was another prominent American psychologist in the field of Behaviorism. Tolman performed maze experiments to demonstrate latent learning in animals. He showed that a rat could run the maze on the first try, if it was previously allowed to explore the maze while not hungry. Tolman evinced that the subject learned useful stimulus information about the world without reference to a reinforcing stimulus (the food). The ability to run the maze correctly on trial one demonstrated flexibility in the use of the learned information. Tolman's stimulus-stimulus (S-S) learning was opposed by the stimulus-response (S-R) orthodoxy of Skinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

anaesthesia;Anaesthesia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
anaesthesia_desc;Anaesthesia (from greek "without sensation") is a state of temporary induced loss of sensation or awareness. Anesthesia enables the painless performance of medical procedures that would cause severe or intolerable pain to an unanesthetized patient.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
antitoxins;Antitoxins;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
antitoxins_desc;An Antitoxin is an antibody with the ability to neutralize a specific toxin. Antitoxins are produced by certain animals, plants, and bacteria. Although they are most effective in neutralizing toxins, they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Antitoxins are made within organisms, but can be injected into other organisms, including humans. This procedure involves injecting an animal with a safe amount of a particular toxin. Then, the animalâ€™s body makes the antitoxin needed to neutralize the toxin. Later, the blood is withdrawn from the animal. When the antitoxin is obtained from the blood, it is purified and injected into a human or other animal, inducing passive immunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
vitamins;Vitamins;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
vitamins_desc;A Vitamin is an organic compound and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound is called a vitamin when the organism cannot make the compound in sufficient quantities, and it must be obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
robert_koch;Robert Koch;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
robert_koch_desc;Rpbert Koch was a German physician and microbiologist. He is considered to be one of the founders of microbiology, he identified the specific causative agents of tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax and gave experimental support for the concept of infectious disease, which included experiments on humans. Koch created and improved laboratory technologies and techniques in the field of microbiology, and made key discoveries in public health.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
joseph_lister;Joseph Lister;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
joseph_lister_desc;Joseph Lister was a British surgeon and a pioneer of antiseptic surgery, who promoted the idea of sterile surgery while working at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.

mountain_warfare;Mountain Warfare;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
mountain_warfare_desc;Mountain warfare refers to warfare in the mountains or similarly rough terrain. This type of warfare is also called Alpine warfare, after the Alps mountains. Mountain warfare is one of the most dangerous types of combat as it involves surviving not only combat with the enemy but also the extreme weather and dangerous terrain. Mountain ranges are of strategic importance since they often act as a natural border, and may also be the origin of a water source. Attacking a prepared enemy position in mountain terrain requires a greater ratio of attacking soldiers to defending soldiers than a war conducted on level ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
barrage_fire;Barrage Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
barrage_fire_desc;A barrage is massed artillery fire aimed at points, typically 20–30 yards (18–27 m) apart, along one or more lines that can be from a few hundred to several thousand yards long. The lines are usually 100 yards (91 m) apart and fire is lifted from one line to the next and one or several lines may be simultaneously engaged by different firing units. The artillery usually fires at a continuous steady rate, using high explosive or, historically, shrapnel shells. A barrage might be from a few or many batteries, or even (rarely) from a single gun. Barrage fire may be defensive to deny or hamper enemy passage through an area or offensive to provide covering fire that neutralises the enemy in an area through or towards which friendly forces are advancing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
counter_battery_fire;Counter-Battery Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
counter_battery_fire_desc;Counter-battery fire is a battlefield military activity to defeat the enemy's indirect fire elements, including their target acquisition, command and control components.
