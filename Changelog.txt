Hi there dear reader!

Making a changelog for GFM is no easy feat since so much content is added regularly and I myself haven't been around for the first few months of development, back when it was just Jman.
When it was created, GFM was named HFMe or HFM Expanded, based on the Historical Flavor Mod by the legendary Sighpies. 
Jman merged content from many mods into HFMe, including but not limited to (because he himself refuses to fully disclose what he merged): GSG, DIM, NNM, PDM and others.
In February of 2021, I joined the team (which was basically just Jman at the time) to add a little flavor here and there. A couple weeks later, he no longer had internet and more or less left the mod to me.
Around that time we had a vote for changing HFMe's name on the modding server since people kept thinking it was a submod and complaining when it crashed, hence our current title of GFM.
Over time, more people have joined the dev team, including but not limited to:
-dr, bugfixing wizard. He finds errors in 5 minutes that would take me hours. The mod would be a mess without him.
-Bob Bobbington, creator of the WIP flag submod and the coming dismantlement rework. He's also great at adding tags.
-Atlas, Iran nerd and mastermind of the Iran rework. I've never met anyone with better knowledge of the region.
-SirRunner, interface expert and utility professional. Thank him for the general traits, disunited kingdom decisions and more.
-General Garcia of the HFM Mexico submod. He kindly sent us his code and refitted a lot of it for GFM.
-Erling, Norwegian patriot. He made the Scandinavian War and Norway flavor (with a bit of help).
Other devs of note: Sarif, Ulf, Magma and Doble.

Now to the content:
I'll list additions in categories, such as the Iran rework, the new Mexico update or interface improvements to keep an overview and underpoints to explain details where necessary.

NEW WITH THIS UPDATE:

Mexican conflicts post-Santa Anna
	-Event in 1855 for the Revolution of Ayutla, installing a liberal democracy
	-Decision for the new constitution that gives top tier reforms but causes a civil war in 75 days
	-The Reform War, caused by the new constitution, sees Los Conservadores rise up against the liberal government with 3 peacedeals
		-Liberal Victory
			-Los Conservadores cores are removed
		-Conservative Victory
			-Los Conservadores become regular Mexico with crap reforms again, cores are removed
		-Stalemate
			-Los Conservadores are re-annexed into Mexico, cores are removed
	-If a liberal victory or stalemate ensued, France under Napoleon III gets a decision to intervene in Mexico during the ACW
		-An event is sent to Spain/Carlist Spain and Britain
			-They can decline or agree to join the intervention, both choices notify France
			-If they agree, they declare war for reparations in 7 days
		-In 7 days, France gets an event to declare war on Mexico for cut down to size
		-Once France, Spain/Carlist Spain or Britain occupies Mexico City, France gets an event for either continuing the war to install Maximilian I or settling for reperations
			-The former creates the Mexican Empire as a French sphereling along the Gulf Coast and Mexico City for 8 infamy that goes to war with Mexico while the French war continues, Spain/Carlist Spain and Britain peace out
			-The latter peaces France, Spain/Carlist Spain and Britain out, each receiving 80.000$ from Mexico
		-If Mexico manages to recapture Mexico City after France created the Mexican Empire, they get an event for Cinco del Mayo, annexing the Mexican Empire and peacing out France who gets notified
		-If France cuts Mexico down to size successfully, they get a decision to install Maximilian I as emperor of all of Mexico, annexing regular Mexico into the Empire and making it a vassal

GENERAL GFM CHANGELOG

	
Submods
	GFM Shattered World
		This alternate start date releases every country in 1836. It is a sandbox scenario with more infamy reduction.
	GFM Dynamic Nations
		This is the flag submod, it adds dynamic flag and country name changes, e.g. US stars. Still WIP.
	GFM Trade Goods
		Warning! This submod was Jman's project and has since not been updated. It has many bugs and is obsolete. We advise against using it.
	GFM Music Submod
		The Music Submod is self-explanatory: It adds more and better music to the game.	

QoL improvements
	-Interface
		-New loading screens
		-Removed menu background in all government tabs, one can click through them to manage armies while in the tab
		-General trait visualisation by green and red listing of defense and attack stats, making generals easier to manage
		-Extended the cultures list size in a country screen so countries with lots of accepted cultures don't end in a ...
		-Extended the battle casualties counter so casualties in the millions are displayed
		-Extended the brigade counter so that 1k+ brigade countries don't end in a ...
		-Extended the country modifier list size so if one has many country modifiers they don't end in a ...
	-Utility
		-Disunted Kingdom decisions for the UK to play as Australia, the Cape Colony or Canada
		-Grants decisions for MP
		-Craftsmen bug fix decision to remove craftsmen of non-accepted cultures
		-Starting option to set infamy reduction to -0.15 for people who like more reduction
	-Casus bellis
		-Transfer for MP
		-Steal puppet
		-Free and puppet country
		-Take Capital
		-Take Capital concession
	-Game Speed
		Many people have said GFM runs faster than HFM for them, personally I find the difference small but noticeable, though a couple people have said it's slower for them.
		The way we optimized is the following: Remember e.g. getting "Boiler explodes" "Foul Murder" "All the Tea in [countryname]" etc. all the time? 
		Those events also fire all the time for AI. We made them and other workplace or issue events player-only, thus reducing event load significantly.
		Another major optimization is the removal of cultures in common/cultures.txt that are defined but unused in the code, thereby costing processing for every pop but not actually being of any use.
		
Canals and Tunnels
	-Kra Canal through Siam to bypass Singapore, only buildable if one spheres Siam and doesn't own Singapore (yes, this was proposed in the 19th century)
	-White Sea Canal from lake Onega to the White Sea, one can sail between the lakes from the start
	-Channel Tunnel from Dover to Calais (yes, this was proposed in the 19th century)
	
New units
	-Stormtroopers
		-Late-game offensive infantry
	-Submarines
		-Late-game ships on par with cruisers	
		
Terrain
	HD terrain textures have been implemented in GFM. I don't know about you, but I find the GFM textures absolutely stunning compared to HFM. Take a look, zoom in, it's so much better.
		
RGO shifting
	Lots of RGO locations just plainly don't make any sense from base game, for example having grain in the Sahara or cotton in Normandy (and much much more).
	These non-sensical RGOs have been moved to realistic locations while also rebalancing general distribution for accuracy (e.g. there was barely any iron in Italy but massive sulfur reserves).

Formable nations
	-Fulani Caliphate: Own all cores as Tukulor Empire
	-Denmark-Norway: Puppet Norway or Denmark or annex them as either
	-Bulgaria-Romania: Own Sofia or Bucharest as either or have them in your spheres
	-Suvarnabhumi: Own the principle cities of Indochina as Burma, Siam, Vietnam or Cambodia

Note: I came up with this list in a couple hours, it is by no means anywhere near complete, it only serves as a rough overview of the kind of content GFM adds. 
It's also biasedly focused more on my commits and more recent additions than early ones because I simply know more about them. 
I'd love to do an in-depth analysis for everything in the mod like I did with the Iran rework, but that just isn't viable to do due to the sheer load of content that has been added.

I hope you enjoy GFM, I and the other devs put a lot of work into it! If you have any suggestions or bug reports, head to the GFM section on the Victoria 2 modding server: https://discord.gg/YhSd5AhhnY
