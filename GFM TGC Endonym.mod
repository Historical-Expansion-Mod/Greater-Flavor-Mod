# I'm using TGC Endonym niche submods as the source of localized that i use for this submods, this localized cover most of the nation except from the new one from the African Rework, I also using the Maxwell Darkwater map as an inspiration to create a map mod that as similarly as possible to the source, other than that i change most of the GFM UI, to be as close as possible to the current TGC UI, the only thing that i add without a source is some icon(unit move arrow, the font colour, the border and afew other things
