# Greater Flavor Mod (GFM)

This mod is based on HFM but greatly expands on it, adding bountiful flavor, provinces, historical accuracy changes, quality of life improvements and more.

IMPORTANT: If you downloaded from Github and for some reason the mod is broken, either:
- Check if you installed correctly.
- Redownload from Github maximum 1 day later.
The mod gets constantly updated, sometimes several times in MINUTES or HOURS. If the mod breaks because of the developers, it gets fixed as quickly as possible, so first check if you installed correctly and if so, wait some hours or minutes and re-download, a fix should've probably been uploaded by then.

Failure to extract the mod may be due to a common GitHub issue, so try downloading again in the case of failure or try downloading from the [Mod DB page] (https://www.moddb.com/mods/gfm)
