2. Go to the mod folder in your Victoria 2 install directory. 
  * If you got the Steam version on Windows this will look something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod
  * If you got a non-Steam version on Windows it might be something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 2/mod
3. Delete the old versions of the mods, if you have any.
4. From the ZIP move everything into the mod folder.
5. Start the game, select the mods you want:

  * GFM SW Submod is the Shattered World submod.
  * GFM Dynamic Nations Submod adds more flag/naming/colour options for each nation and adds some new mechanics involving this (Eg. Dynamic Dominions). Note: The Large Address Adware Patch is HIGHLY recommended.
