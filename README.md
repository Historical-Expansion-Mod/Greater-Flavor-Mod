# Greater Flavor Mod (GFM)

This mod is HFM, but further expanded upon, adding bountiful flavour, provinces, historical accuracy changes, etc

IMPORTANT: If you downloaded from Github and for some reason the mod is broken, either:
- Check if you installed correctly.
- Redownload from Github maximum 1 day later.
The mod gets constantly updated sometimes several times in MINUTES or HOURS, but if the mod breaks because of the developers, it gets fixed as fast as possible, so first check if you installed correctly and if so, wait some hours or minutes and re-download, a fix should've probably been uploaded by then.

Failure to extract the mod may be due to a common GitHub issue, so try downloading again in the case of failure.

## Submods
  * GFM is standalone - you do not need the original HFM to play.
  * GFM Shattered World Submod releases every single nation.
  * GFM Low Resolution Submod changes files to a lower resolution, making the gameplay faster.
  * GFM Dynamic Nations Submod adds more flag/naming/colour options for each nation and adds mechanics for this (Eg. Dynamic Dominions).
       Note: The Large Address Aware Patch is HIGHLY recommended.
  * GFM More Cultures adds a lot more cultures to the game
  * GFM Fantasy Formables adds "fantasy" nations as formables

  * GFM 1830 is a submod that allows people to start the game in 1830 and has content for the added years
  * Music Sub Mod adds more music to the game. This is located in a separate repository which can be found [here]( https://github.com/Elijah-maker/GFM-Music-Submod)
  * Absolute gigachad Jay de Brabant has [made a submod]( https://github.com/LePetitJayJay/Victoria-2-Anime-Flags-Mod) for GFM adding anime girl flags (the repo also includes regular HFM flags).
