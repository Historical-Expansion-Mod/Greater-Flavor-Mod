4. From the ZIP move everything into the mod folder.

  * GFM SW Submod is the Shattered World submod.
  * GFM Low Resolution Submod changes files to a lower resolution, making the gameplay faster.
  * GFM Dynamic Nations Submod adds more flag/naming/colour options for each nation and adds mechanics for this (Eg. Dynamic Dominions).
