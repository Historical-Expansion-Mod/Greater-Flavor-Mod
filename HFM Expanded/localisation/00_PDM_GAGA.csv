the_metro;The Metro (+);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
the_metro_desc;Rapid transit began with the opening in 1863 of the Metropolitan Railway, now part of the London Underground. Rapid transit evolved from steam railways during the late 19th century. In 1890 the City & South London Railway in London was the first electric rapid transit railway. The electric railway eventually was merged into London Underground. The technology swiftly spread to other cities in Europe, as in Budapest, Hungary in 1896, and then to the United States. A number of elevated systems were built, starting with the 1893 100% designed electric Liverpool Overhead Railway, which also had a small underground section complete with station. The elevated railways in Chicago and New York were converted to electric from steam propulsion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
skyscrapers;Skyscraper Architecture;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
skyscrapers_desc;Modern skyscrapers are built with steel or reinforced concrete frameworks and curtain walls of glass or polished stone. They utilize mechanical equipment such as water pumps and elevators. Until the 19th century, buildings of over six storeys were rare, as having great numbers of stairs to climb was impractical for inhabitants, and water pressure was usually insufficient to supply running water above 50 m (164 ft). Most early skyscrapers emerged in the land-strapped areas of Chicago, London, and New York toward the end of the 19th century. A land boom in Melbourne, Australia between 1888–1891 spurred the creation of a significant number of early skyscrapers, though none of these were steel reinforced and few remain today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
social_engineering;Social Engineering (!);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
social_engineering_desc;Social engineering is a discipline in social science that refers to efforts to influence popular attitudes and social behaviors on a large scale, whether by governments or private groups. In the political arena, the counterpart of social engineering is political engineering. Virtually all law and governance has the effect of seeking to change behavior and could be considered ''social engineering'' to some extent. Governments also influence behavior more subtly through incentives and disincentives built into economic policy and tax policy, for instance, and have done so for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
technocracy;Technocracy (!);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
technocracy_desc;Technocracy is a form of government in which experts in technology would be in control of all decision making. Scientists, engineers, and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills, would compose the governing body, instead of politicians, businessmen, and economists. In a technocracy, decision makers would be selected based upon how knowledgeable and skillful they are in their field. The term technocracy was originally used to designate the application of the scientific method to solving social problems, in counter distinction to the traditional economic, political, or philosophic approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
roaring_twenties;Roaring Twenties;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
roaring_twenties_desc;The Roaring Twenties is a term sometimes used to refer to the 1920s, characterizing the era's distinctive cultural edge in most of the world's major cities for a period of sustained economic prosperity. ''Normalcy'' returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism during World War I, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, and Art Deco peaked. Economically, the era saw the large-scale diffusion and use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, and electricity, unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. Finally the Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era, as the Great Depression set in worldwide, bringing years of worldwide gloom and hardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
art_deco;Art Deco;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
art_deco_desc;Art Deco is an influential visual arts design style which first appeared in France during the 1920s, flourished internationally during the 30s and 40s, then waned in the post-World War II era. It is an eclectic style that combines traditional craft motifs with Machine Age imagery and materials. The style is often characterized by rich colors, bold geometric shapes and lavish ornamentation. Deco emerged from the Interwar period when rapid industrialization was transforming culture. One of its major attributes is an embrace of technology. This distinguishes Deco from the organic motifs favored by its predecessor Art Nouveau.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

import_substitution_industrialization_2_desc;The growth of the global economy in the nineteenth and early twentieth century resulted in increased demand for industrial goods by non-Western societies. However, the realities of war in the industrial age and increasing economic instability of periods of expansion and contraction resulted in non-Western societies at times being unable to meet their needs for industrial goods from the traditional producers of such goods in the West. As a result, an opening for producers in non-Western societies to meet the demand for those industrial goods that could not be acquired easily from the West arose, and industrialization in the non-Western world began to grow. Eventually pressure to protect these new industries from competition from overseas would lead some nations which had maintained political independence to adopt policies of import substitiution industrialization to encourage their societies to break their dependence upon the West for industrial goods and, by extension, strengthen their own societies in the global economic system.;La croissance de l'économie mondiale au XIXe siecle et début du XXe siecle a entraîné une demande accrue pour les produits industriels par les sociétés non occidentales. Cependant, les réalités de la guerre dans l'ere industrielle et l'augmentation de l'instabilité économique avec des périodes d'expansion et de contraction, a entraîné pour les non-occidentaux, une incapacité a répondre a leurs besoins en matiere de produits industriels de l'Ouest. En conséquence, un créneau pour les producteurs non occidentaux de répondre a la demande qui ne pouvait etre acquise facilement de l'Occident est apparu, et l'industrialisation dans le monde non-occidental a commencé a croître. Finalement, la pression pour protéger ces industries nouvelles de la concurrence de l'étranger a entraînait certains pays qui ont maintenu l'indépendance politique a adopter des politiques d'industrialisation en substitution aux importations afin d'encourager leurs sociétés a rompre leur dépendance a l'égard de l'Occident et, par extension, a renforcer leurs propres sociétés dans le systeme économique mondial. L'industrialisation de substitution des importations gagna en influence au cours du XXe siecle. ;Das Wachstum der Weltwirtschaft im neunzehnten und frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert führte zu einer gesteigerten Industriegüternachfrage durch nichtwestliche Gesellschaften. Die Kriege des Industriezeitalters und die zunehmende wirtschaftliche Instabilität führte in nichtwestlichen Gesellschaften jedoch zeitweilig dazu, dass sie ihren Industriegüterbedarf nicht mehr mit Lieferungen von den angestammten Produzenten dieser Güter im Westen decken konnten. Dies gab Produzenten aus nichtwestlichen Gesellschaften stetig besser werdende Möglichkeiten, den Bedarf von Industriegütern, der durch die Einfuhr von Westimporten nicht einfach gedeckt werden konnte, mit lokalen Produkten zu decken. Dies führte zu einer zunehmenden Industrialisierung der nichtwestlichen Welt. Schließlich führte der Druck, diese neuen Industrien vor der Konkurrenz aus Übersee zu schützen, in einigen Nationen, die sich ihre politische Unabhängigkeit zur Anwendung der Importsubstitutions-Industrialisierung bewahrt hatten, dazu, ihre Industriegüter-bezogene Abhängigkeit vom Westen zu beenden und die Stellung ihrer eigenen Gesellschaften im globalen Wirtschaftssystem zu kräftigen. Die Importsubstitutions-Industrialisierung wurde im Verlauf des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts immer wichtiger, da die Ressourcen des Westens zunehmend zur Lösung westlicher Probleme eingesetzt wurden.;;El crecimiento de la economía mundial en el siglo XIX y principios del XX provocó un aumento de la demanda de bienes industriales en países no occidentales. Sin embargo, las realidades de la guerra en la era industrial y la creciente inestabilidad económica, con periodos de expansión y contracción cada vez más marcados, provocaron que, en determinados momentos, estos países no pudieran satisfacer sus necesidades a través de sus productores habituales, en occidente. Como consecuencia de ello, se crearon las condiciones necesarias para la aparición de productores no occidentales, capaces de nutrir la demanda de bienes industriales, lo que fomentó la industrialización del mundo no occidental. Al final, la presión para proteger estas industrias frente a la competición extranjera llevaría a algunos países que habían mantenido su independencia política a adoptar políticas de industrialización para sustituir las importaciones, a fin de romper su dependencia de los productos industriales occidentales y, por extensión, reforzar su papel en el sistema económico global. La industrialización sustitutiva iría cobrando mayor importancia a lo largo del siglo XX, a medida que los recursos de occidente se emplearan cada vez más para resolver los problemas de occidente.;;;;;;;;x,,

Air warfare, and indeed aviation itself, was still in its infancy - and the direct effect of rifle calibre machine guns and light bombs of World War I aircraft was very limited compared with the power of (for instance) a World War II fighter bomber, but close support aircraft still had a powerful psychological impact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
crop_rotation_invention;Crop Rotation (#);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
crop_rotation_invention_desc;Crop rotation gives various nutrients to the soil. A traditional element of crop rotation is the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops. Crop rotation also mitigates the build-up of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one species is continuously cropped, and can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

pit_mining_invention;Pit Mining (#);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
pit_mining_invention_desc;Open-pit mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rock are found near the surface, that is, where the overburden (surface material covering the valuable deposit) is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunneling (as would be the case for sand, cinder, and gravel).;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
strip_mining_invention;Strip Mining (#);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
strip_mining_invention_desc;Strip mining is the practice of mining a seam of mineral, by first removing a long strip of overlying soil and rock (the overburden). It is most commonly used to mine coal and lignite (brown coal). Strip mining is only practical when the ore body to be excavated is relatively near the surface. This type of mining uses some of the largest machines on earth, including bucket-wheel excavators which can move as much as 12,000 cubic meters of earth per hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

steam_water_pumps_desc;Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical. The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont patented in 1606 the first steam engine. In 1698 Thomas Savery patented a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped. Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water. Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston, and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

neoliberal_theory_desc;Originally neoliberalism was an economic philosophy that emerged among European liberal scholars in the 1930s attempting to trace a so-called 'Third' or 'Middle Way' between the conflicting philosophies of classical liberalism and collectivist central planning. The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which were mostly blamed on the economic policy of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term neoliberal tended to refer to theories at variance with the more laissez-faire doctrine of classical liberalism and promoted instead a market economy under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the social market economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and its posterity the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities. Though scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history long before the European age of discovery and voyages to the New World. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century and in the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectedness of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

critical_theory_desc;Critical theory is a school of thought that stresses the reflective assessment and critique of society and culture by applying knowledge from the social sciences and the humanities. In philosophy, the term critical theory describes the neo-Marxist philosophy of the Frankfurt School, which was developed in Germany in the 1930s. Frankfurt theorists drew on the critical methods of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. Critical theory maintains that ideology is the principal obstacle to human liberation. It was primarily established by five Frankfurt School theoreticians: Herbert Marcuse, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and Erich Fromm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

mathematical_sociology_desc;Mathematical sociology is the use of mathematics to construct social theories. Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms. Starting in the early 1940s, Nicolas Rashevsky, and subsequently in the late 1940s, Anatol Rapoport and others, developed a relational and probabilistic approach to the characterization of large social networks in which the nodes are persons and the links are acquaintanceship. During the late 1940s, formulas were derived that connected local parameters such as closure of contacts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
post_colonialism;Post Colonialism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
post_colonialism_desc;Postcolonialism or postcolonial studies is an academic discipline featuring methods of intellectual discourse that analyze, explain, and respond to the cultural legacies of colonialism and imperialism, to the human consequences of controlling a country and establishing settlers for the economic exploitation of the native people and their land. Drawing from postmodern schools of thought, postcolonial studies analyse the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by analyzing the functional relations of social and political power that sustain colonialism and neocolonialism - the how and the why of an imperial regime's representations (social, political, cultural) of the imperial colonizer and of the colonized people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
humanistic_psychology;Humanistic Psychology;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
humanistic_psychology_desc;Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity, and first-person categories, the humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole person - not just the fragmented parts of the personality or cognitive functioning. Humanism focused on fundamentally and uniquely human issues, such as individual free will, personal growth, self-actualization, self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. The humanistic approach was distinguished by its emphasis on subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

An example is the glass bottle making machine developed 1905. It replaced highly paid glass blowers and child labor helpers and led to the mass production of glass bottles. After 1900 factories were electrified, and electric motors and controls were used to perform more complicated mechanical operations. This resulted in mechanized processes to manufacture almost all goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

epic_theatre;Epic Theatre;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
epic_theatre_desc;Epic theatre (German: episches Theater) was a theatrical movement arising in the early to mid-20th century from the theories and practice of a number of theatre practitioners, including Erwin Piscator, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vsevolod Meyerhold and, most famously, Bertolt Brecht. The term epic theater comes from Erwin Piscator who coined it during his first year as Director of Berlin's Volksbühne (1924-1927). Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the style, and popularized it. Epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what he calls gestus. The epic form describes both a type of written drama and a methodological approach to the production of plays.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
color_motion_picture;Color Motion Picture;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
color_motion_picture_desc;After the advent of motion pictures, a tremendous amount of energy was invested in the production of photography in natural color. Early movies were not actually color movies, since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards. In 1902, Edward Raymond Turner produced first films with natural color process rather than using colorization techniques. In 1908, kinemacolor was introduced. In the same year, A Visit to the Seaside, a short film became the first natural color movie to be publicly presented. In 1917 technicolor was introduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
frankfurt_school;Frankfurt School;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
frankfurt_school_desc;The Frankfurt School (German: Frankfurter Schule) is a school of social theory and philosophy associated in part with the Institute for Social Research at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. The school initially formed during the interwar period in Germany and consisted of dissidents who were at home neither in the existent capitalist, fascist nor communist systems that had formed during the interwar period. Meanwhile, many of these theorists believed that traditional theory could not adequately explain the turbulent and unexpected development of capitalist societies in the twentieth century. Critical of both capitalism and Soviet socialism, their writings pointed to the possibility of an alternative path to social development.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
theodor_w_adorno;Theodor W. Adorno;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
theodor_w_adorno_desc;Theodor W. Adorno was a German sociologist, philosopher and musicologist known for his critical theory of society. He was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the work of Freud, Marx and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings - such as Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966) - strongly influenced the European New Left.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
max_horkheimer;Max Horkheimer;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
max_horkheimer_desc;Max Horkheimer was a German Jewish philosopher and sociologist who was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the 'Frankfurt School' of social research. His most important works include The Eclipse of Reason (1947), ''Between Philosophy and Social Science'' (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, The Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
walter_benjamin;Walter Benjamin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
walter_benjamin_desc;Walter Bendix Schönflies Benjamin was a German philosopher and cultural critic. An eclectic thinker, combining elements of German idealism, Romanticism, historical materialism, and Jewish mysticism, Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to aesthetic theory and Western Marxism. He is associated with the Frankfurt School. His turn to Marxism in the 1930s was partly due to the influence of Bertolt Brecht, who developed a theater notable for its Verfremdungseffekt (defamiliarization, alienation). An earlier influence was friend Gershom Scholem, founder of the academic study of the Kabbalah and of Jewish mysticism. Scholars often cite Benjamin's most famous works, especially the essays ''The Task of the Translator'' (1923) and ''The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'' (1936).;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
erich_fromm;Erich Fromm;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
erich_fromm_desc;Erich Seligmann Fromm was a German social psychologist, psychoanalyst, sociologist, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. He was associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory. Fromm's best known work, ''Escape from Freedom'', focuses on the human urge to seek a source of authority and control upon reaching a freedom that was thought to be an individual’s true desire. Fromm’s critique of the modern political order and capitalist system led him to seek insights from medieval feudalism. In Escape from Freedom, he found favor with the lack of individual freedom, rigid structure, and obligations required on the members of medieval society. The culmination of Fromm's social and political philosophy was his book ''The Sane Society'', published in 1955, which argued in favor of a humanistic and democratic socialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
nicolas_rashevsky;Nicolas Rashevsky;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
nicolas_rashevsky_desc;Nicolas Rashevsky was an American theoretical physicist who pioneered mathematical biology, and is also considered the father of mathematical biophysics and theoretical biology. He studied theoretical physics at the University of Kiev in Ukraine (then Russian Empire) before 1917, and immigrated first to Turkey, then to Poland, France, and finally to the US in 1924 because of the October revolution. In USA he worked at first for the Westinghouse Research Labs in Pittsburgh where he focused on the theoretical physics modeling of the cell division and the mathematics of cell fission, a subject that was anecdotally said to have attracted fission-related defense interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

anatol_rapoport_desc;Anatol Rapoport was a Russian-born American mathematical psychologist. He contributed to general systems theory, mathematical biology and to the mathematical modeling of social interaction and stochastic models of contagion. Rapoport had a versatile mind, working in mathematics, psychology, biology, game theory, social network analysis, and peace and conflict studies. For example, he pioneered in the modeling of parasitism and symbiosis, researching cybernetic theory. This went on to give a conceptual basis for his lifelong work in conflict and cooperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

systems_theory_desc;"Systems theory is the interdisciplinary study of systems in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems at all nesting levels in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of systems thinking; alternatively as a goal output of systems science and systems engineering, with an emphasis on generality useful across a broad range of systems (versus the particular models of individual fields).";;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
mahatma_gandhi;Mahatma Gandhi;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
mahatma_gandhi_desc;Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was the preeminent leader of Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. Gandhi attempted to practise nonviolence and truth in all situations, and advocated that others do the same. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means to both self-purification and social protest. Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest at point-blank range.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
mackinder_and_the_heartland_theory;Mackinder and The Heartland Theory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
mackinder_and_the_heartland_theory_desc;"Mackinder's Heartland Theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the Heartland - which wouldn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent. The basic notions of Mackinder's doctrine involve considering the geography of the Earth as being divided into two sections: the World Island (or Core), comprising Eurasia and Africa; and the Peripheral ''islands'', including the Americas, Australia, Japan, the British Isles, and Oceania. Mackinder's notion of geopolitics was summed up when he said: ''Who rules Central and Eastern Europe commands the Heartland. Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island. Who rules the World-Island commands the World.'' His doctrine was influential during the World Wars and the Cold War, as Germany and later Russia each made territorial strides toward the ''Heartland''.";;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
appeasement;Appeasement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
appeasement_desc;Appeasement in a political context is a diplomatic policy of making political or material concessions to an enemy power in order to avoid conflict. The term is most often applied to the foreign policy of the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany between 1937 and 1939. His policies of avoiding war with Germany have been the subject of intense debate for seventy years among academics, politicians and diplomats. The historians' assessments have ranged from condemnation for allowing Adolf Hitler's Germany to grow too strong, to the judgment that he had no alternative and acted in Britain's best interests. At the time, these concessions were widely seen as positive, and the Munich Pact concluded on 30 September 1938 among Germany, Britain, France, and Italy prompted Chamberlain to announce that he had secured ''peace for our time.'';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
abraham_maslow;Abraham Maslow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
abraham_maslow_desc;Abraham Harold Maslow was an American psychologist who was best known for creating Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs in priority, culminating in self-actualization. Maslow was a psychology professor at Brandeis University, Brooklyn College, New School for Social Research and Columbia University. He stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a ''bag of symptoms.'';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
otto_rank;Otto Rank;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
otto_rank_desc;Otto Rank was an Austrian psychoanalyst, writer, and teacher. Born in Vienna as Otto Rosenfeld, he was one of Sigmund Freud's closest colleagues for 20 years, a prolific writer on psychoanalytic themes, an editor of the two most important analytic journals, managing director of Freud's publishing house and a creative theorist and therapist. In 1926, Otto Rank left Vienna for Paris. For the remaining 14 years of his life, Rank had a successful career as a lecturer, writer and therapist in France and the U.S. Today, Rank can be seen as one of the great pioneers in the fields of humanistic psychology, existential psychotherapy, Gestalt therapy and transpersonal psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

carl_rogers_desc;Carl Ransom Rogers was an influential American psychologist and among the founders of the humanistic approach (or client-centered approach) to psychology. Rogers is widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of psychotherapy research and was honored for his pioneering research with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions by the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1956. The person-centered approach, his own unique approach to understanding personality and human relationships, found wide application in various domains such as psychotherapy and counseling (client-centered therapy), education (student-centered learning), organizations, and other group settings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
modern_public_transportation;Modern Public Transportation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
modern_public_transportation_desc;Public transport modes include city buses, trolleybuses, trams and passenger trains, rapid transit (metro/subways/undergrounds etc) and ferries. Public transport between cities is dominated by airlines, coaches, and intercity rail. High-speed rail networks are being developed in many parts of the world. For historical and economic reasons, there are differences internationally regarding use and extent of public transport. While countries in the Old World tend to have extensive and frequent systems serving their old and dense cities, many cities of the New World have more sprawl and much less comprehensive public transport.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
