haitian_integration_desc; While France has restored order to the rebelliuos colony of Haiti, resistance and tension has persisted in the colony.

EVTDESC7790001;Due to the Seven Years War, the Haitian Revolt, and the sale of Louisiana by Napoleon Bonaparte, France no longer posesses it's lands in Hispaniola or New France. As the age of Imperialism begins and we look to expand our influence, the question is whether we should make a return to any of our former american colonies. Though reclaiming Haiti would be a bloody campaign, It is relatively defensless and without allies. However, if we were to reclaim New France itself we will certainly risk war with The United Kingdom, and will be gaurenteed war with the United States. While we may be able to regain some land trhough negotiations, much of these lands must be regained via war, something that will cause much internal unrest and international tension. If we are successful, restoring French America would be a major source of pride for both ourselves and our Empire, however the cost of war may be far more than the colonies are worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790010;The institution of a revolutionary regime in France in led most of the European monarchies to form coalitions against it. However, The military successes of the armies of the First Republic resulted in a considerable expansion of the national territory all the way to the left bank of the Rhine. While Napoleon Bonaparte would continue French conquests, His eventual defeat would lead France to be stripped of it's new territory by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The prospect of reclaiming France's natural borders, however, remained popular to many people both within the government and France itself. Despite it's cost in French blood and iron, We have finally reclaimed France's Natural Borders. While German Nationalism and the rebellious Flemish and Dutch may upset the fragile peace, for now France has proven itself to be the True master of Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC7790011;In 1838 Jean François Langlois, commander of the whaling ship Cachalot, embarked on a grandiose scheme for a French colony at Akaroa. After a dubious land purchase from Maori he established the Nanto-Bordelaise Company in France to carry out the projec, and In 1839, King Louis-Philippe agreed to provide assistance. The French representative for the settlement, Captain Charles François Lavaud, sailed for New Zealand in April 1840. A month later, the ship Comte de Paris set off for Akaroa carrying 53 emigrants. The French scheme sparked debate in England and France, and bowing to pressure to colonise the country, the British government sent out William Hobson in 1839. He signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, and claimed sovereignty over the South Island on 17 June.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While France lost the territory during the Seven Years' War, France regained sovereignty of the western territory in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800. But strained by obligations in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte decided to sell the territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, ending France's presence in Louisiana.\n\nAttempting to reconquer the vast territory of Louisana will be a mounmental task...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Slowly annexed by the United Kingdom over the course of the 18th century, Acadia is once again in French hands. If we intend to keep Acadia this time, we must invest in the colony, funding new settlers, deportation of rebellious english colonials, and building infrastructure throughout the colony.

the_imperial_federation_desc; Ever since it's liberation from the British, Canada has remained a quiet part of our Empire. It's low population, combined with the relatively isolated position has led to little change. As the British slowly parition their empire into dominions, the French-Canadian memebers of the national government have begun to question Canada's role in the French empire. Due to it's colonial status, two paths are open for Canada. Either we can create a French-Canadian dominion in the style of the British, or we could integrate Canada into metropolitan France itself. Similar successes in French Guiana has shown that distance is a non-issue. And as White, French speaking Catholics, Canada will be far easier to integrate compared to the Algerian departments. If we are to do this, we must act fast, and integrate Canada before any sort of French-Canadien nationalism can arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_imperial_federation_louisiana_desc; Ever since it's reconquest from the United States, Louisiane has been a relatively peaceful colony. But as France turns to focus on colonial exploits in Africa and Asia, the question arises on what to do with out colonies in North America. Louisiane was primarily settled in the 1840s by French settlers from France, and as such it still maintains strong ties to the Motherland. If we wish to avoid our empire fracturing like that of the Spanish or the English, we should take steps towards integrating Louisiane into Metropolitan France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reactionaires propose a harsh system of oppression, forced emigration, systematic relocations, and even execution by the military if the locals refuse to follow orders. At the same time, we will offer large incentives for french families to settle in Algeria, to increase the Pied-Noir population.

While there have been concerns that the native Maori will be a problem, the Military has been dispatched to forcibly pacify the natives and enforce French rule over the Islands. A nation-wide propaganda campaign will be organized to attract settlers to the Islands, to avoid the low population problems that French Lousiana and New France suffered from, however the effectiveness of these policies will remain to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790100;With the Rhineland back under French control, The question has been raised as to what to do with the new "French" subjects. Despite the German nature of the West Bank, The Rhinelanders had not been enemies of Revolutionairy France, unlike the Spaniards or Portuguese. Prussia, even after their incorporation of the Rhineland and Westphalia in 1815, were regarded by the Rhinelanders with more suspicion, due to their Francophile feeling. The incorporation of such a large number of non-French citizens has also brought up France's cultural diversity in other areas of the Empire, such as in Algeria or Flanders. Some of the more conservative politicians call for a purely French state, united in one language and culture. The Liberals, however, call for granting the Rhinelanders autonomy similar to that of the Walloons. While Autonomy will seriously hinder our assimilation efforts, it may reduce unrest in the Rhineland and prevent giving the Germans reason to intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC7790101;French rule over the Rhineland has been firmly cemented in the last 15 years. The Rhenish autonomy laws, as well as the cultural exchange between the Rhineland and the rest of France, has finally earned the loyalty of the Rhenish people. As elements of French culture are merged with that of German culture, the Rhineland, while far more diverse than the rest of European France, is slowly but surely becoming an integral part of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
