support_january_uprising_desc;After Martial Law was declared, those designated for conscription secretly fled from Warsaw (Jan. 14–15, 1863), sought refuge in the nearby woodlands, and on January 22 issued a manifesto calling for a national insurrection. Although they were greatly outnumbered, poorly equipped, and successful in only a few engagements, the rebels gained support among the artisan, worker, lower gentry, and official classes in the cities and stimulated peasant revolts against the large landlords in rural areas. We could support this uprising against the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

russian_vladivostokSOV_desc;In July of 1860 the port of Vladivostok, or “Ruler of the East,” was founded near the Korean frontier.  It would become a major Russian trade port and shipbuilding yard. Eventually, it would become the focal point of an intercontinental railroad as well as a major scientific, cultural, and industrial center in its own right. The Czar dreamed that the city would become a hub connecting the west with the east. Perhaps the railroad to Vladivostok will eventually replace the Suez Canal as the bearer of goods and raw materials between the East and the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

finnish_diet_desc;Not until June 1863, after the Crimean War had taken place, did Alexander II call the Finnish Diet again.

The changes included making the diet a regularly convening body, a promise which was kept by the Emperor when the diet convened again in January 1867. The result was greater Finnish Autonomy within the Russian Empire and a improvement in the relations of the Finnish Parliament and the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

switch_to_early_russian_tech_desc;Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality, also known as Official Nationality was the dominant ideological doctrine of Russian emperor Nicholas I. "The Triad" of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833 circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev and Nikolay Gogol. Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia's first statewide political ideology since the sixteenth century, indicated the nation's brewing transition to modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

This elite was divided into Slavophiles and Westernizers, according to their views on the path Russia should take in the future, and the social class they represented was called intelligentsia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
