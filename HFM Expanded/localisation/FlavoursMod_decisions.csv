begin_pax_britannica_desc;Latin for 'British Peace'\n\n The Napoleonic Wars left Great Britain as the most powerful naval country in the world, with no meaningful rivals. The country's economic and strategic strength was buttressed by the fleet, localized military action was a staple of the not-entirely-peaceful 'Pax Britannica'. In addition, the threat of naval force was a significant factor in diplomacy. \n\nDuring the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive. The sea routes to the colonies, especially those linking Britain to India were vital. \n\n§RNOTE: This will cause Britain to reject all alliances with great powers unless it is threatened by another rising great power.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

singapore_strategy_title;The Singapore Strategy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
singapore_strategy_desc;The Singapore strategy was a naval defence policy of the British Empire that evolved in a series of war plans from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base; Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base; work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades. The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The port was primarily used as a summer anchorage for the Royal Navy's China Station and it was also used as a health resort. It served as a port of call for ships of the Royal Navy in the Far East (well behind Hong Kong in the south). Certain aspects of the administration not directly pertaining to military matters were left under Chinese control, and the port itself remained a free port until 1923.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l'indigenat. \n\n The decree allowed for native Jews to automatically become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the Code de l'Indigenat.

imperial_japanese_navy_title;Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imperial_japanese_navy_desc;Japanese statesman Iwakura Tomomi submitted a document to the Dajokan titled "Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan. In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions was no longer Japan's primary military concern and that that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy. After lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

form_mittelafrika_desc;Mittelafrika ("Middle Africa") is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany's foreign policy aims at the end of the long 19th century. The difference between the two was that Mittelafrika would be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states. \n\nGerman strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa, German South-West Africa, and Cameroon could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Belgian Congo alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,er German aim of economic self-sufficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

establish_panslavism_rus_desc;Pan-Slavism, a movement which crystallized in the mid-19th century, is the political ideology concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the Slavic-speaking peoples. Its main impact occurred in the Balkans, where non-Slavic empiresthe Byzantine Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Venicehad ruled the South Slavs for centuries. \n\nExtensive pan-Slavism began much like Pan-Germanism, both of which grew from the sense of unity and nationalism experienced within ethnic groups after the French Revolution and the consequent Napoleonic Wars against European monarchies. Like other Romantic nationalist movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of history, philology, and folklore actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the Southern Slavic independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, unlike the temporary charter, the monarchy would now be the direct exerciser of that power, rather than the branches of government. This royal power would be exercised by and with the advice and consent of the People's Assembly, the State Council (the cabinet), and the courts.

These were converted from hereditary governors to appointed governmental posts, as had been done by Chinese Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era rulers in first recognizing Tusi (tribal leaders) as imperial officials, then replacing them with imperial appointees. The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and mueang developed into provinces. \n\nResistance to these reforms would cause uprisings by traditional local leaders around the Kingdom for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire. The whole establishment of this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the active service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

reforms_of_abdul_hamid_ii_desc;Abdul Hamid II was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He oversaw a period of decline, with rebellions, particularly in the Balkans, he suspended both the Ottoman  constitution and Parliament in $YEAR$ and accomplished highly effective power and control. \n\nModernization of the Ottoman Empire occurred during his reign, including reform of the bureaucracy, the extension of the Rumelia Railway and Anatolia Railway and the construction of the Baghdad Railway and Hejaz Railway. In addition, a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898. The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education: many professional schools were established, including Law School, School of Arts, School of Trades, Civil Engineering School, The Veterinarian School, The Customs School, The Farming School, The Linguistic School, and more.\n\nAbdul Hamid II attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohlcr and, finally, Colmar Von der Goltz as military advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ottoman_national_anthemn_title;The Imperial Anthemn of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ottoman_national_anthemn_desc;The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the Mahmudiye Marsi.\n\nLike in many other monarchies of its time, the anthem of the Ottoman Empire was an imperial anthem, not a national one. Hence it paid homage to a specific ruler and a new anthem was composed at each imperial succession. However, in $YEAR$, with the Tanzimat reforms, the Mecidiye Marsi was recognized as the first official Ottoman national anthem. The first official Ottoman national flag (which was in essence identical to the present-day Turkish flag) was also adopted in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
