EVTDESC46306;A political power dispute arose in the heart of the elite class, which was reflected in Maranhão by the opposition of liberals and conservatives. When Pedro de Araújo Lima became prime minister, provoking the so-called conservative regression, the Maranhão conservatives took advantage of the opportunity to remove the liberals in power and weaken them further by contracting the service of the cattle ranchers, traditionally supported by the liberals. The event which began the revolt was the detention of the brother of the rancher Gomes, a liberal, by the order of a submayor of the town of Manga, a conservative. Contesting the detention of his brother, Gomes, with the support of a contingent of the National Guard, invaded the municipal jail and freed him in $YEAR$, the beginning of a rebellion against the conservative government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC46305;Until 1822 Grão-Pará had been a separate viceroyalty from Brazil, reporting herself directly to Portugal. The viceroyalty united with Brazil in the fight against Portugal but once the fight for independence ended and a provincial government named by the Brazilian Emperor was installed, the local leaders were marginalized from power. A rebellion broke out in 1831 in the military garrison of Belém involving one of these local leaders, Batista Campos, which was jailed. The indignation of the poor grew, and in 1833 already there was talk of converting Brazil into a federation. The provincial president unleashed a repressive political wave, in an attempt to contain the separatists. The name "Cabanagem" refers to the type of hut used by the poorest people in the province. The elite agriculturists of Grão-Pará, while living much better, resented their lack of participation in the central government's decision making, which was dominated by the provinces of the Southeast and Northeast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

However, the fate of both Tacna and Arica was to be decided by a plebiscite to be held in 1893. Due to different points of view, both countries were not able to agree on the conditions of this plebiscite and so it was not held.

EVTDESC46610102;When Bolivia became independent from Spain on 1825, it took possession of the territories that corresponded to its colonial administration in accordance with the uti possidetis juris of 1810. Bolivia claimed the maritime territory westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean between the Rio Salado on the south and the Rio Loa on the north, which included part of the Atacama Desert. Later in the mid 19th century, Chile made claims to the desert area following the discovery and exploitation of nitrate deposits and the move en masse of its population to work in the new found richness in Antofagasta. Because of that, the following decades were witness to much bloodshed on the borders of Bolivia, Peru and Chile. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put a proposal, with international approval, to solve this problem amicably and set terms for new borders, paying indemnities for all involved.

In the years following the Peasant's Revolt, conscription was required in order to reinforce what the Egyptian army had lost in the revolt. In $YEAR$, Druze militias rose up against their Egyptian rulers in Hauran and defeated a 400-man force led by Ali Agha al-Busayli, the governor of Hauran. A number of other small expeditions followed but were unable to achieve any decisive victory. Druze from Mount Lebanon flooded into the Druze force as skirmishes continued for the next few months. Months later, the Druze were decisively defeated in the Wadi Bakka by Egyptian forces.

EVTDESC46800;Believed to be a estate built for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, Machu Picchu was built around 1450 but it was abandoned a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest.

Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Inti Watana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ researchers believe this to be the fabled "Lost City of the Incas", the last Inca capital, founded by Manco Inca but lost to the ages, the fire and the steel of the Spanish conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

Scores of people died while tsunamis and fires destroyed thousands of buildings.  In Edo alone, a total of about 50,000 houses and over 50 temples were either destroyed by the earthquake shaking or subsequent fires. The earthquakes were blamed on a giant catfish, Namazu, thrashing about and Ukiyo-e prints depicting Namazu became very popular around this time. The significance being that earthquakes at the time were popularly attributed to the thrashing about of a mythological catfish under the earth, normally kept under control by the deity Kashima using a large rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

After a small earthquake, there was little concern because it was so weak and many small tremors had also been felt in the previous few months. However 35 minutes later the first tsunami wave struck the coast, followed by a second a few minutes later. The waves reached a height of 38.2m and caused such damage that the event is one of the most destructive seismic events in Japanese history. The power of the tsunami was great: large numbers of victims were found with broken bodies or missing limbs. As was their normal practice each evening, the local fishing fleets were all at sea when the tsunamis struck. In the deep water the wave went unnoticed.

The shaking lasted for five minutes at Caleta Pabellón de Pica, a coastal town 70km south of Iquique. The earthquake caused significant damage over most of the coastal parts of the Tarapacá and Antofagasta Regions. The tsunami caused a 10m  wave along about 500km of coast, from Arica in the north to Mejillones in the south. At Arica the water reached the cathedral. The hulk of the U.S. gunboat Wateree, which had been beached hundreds of meters inland by the final wave of the tsunami triggered by the Arica earthquake, was moved several kilometers to the north along the coast and nearer the shoreline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Then, the first wave arrived at Arica 52 minutes after the earthquake, with a 12m height, followed by the largest 16m wave 73 minutes later. The  tsunami drove three ships anchored in port nearly 800m inland: the 1560-ton Peruvian corvette America, the U.S. gunboat Wateree and the U.S. store ship Fredonia, which was completely destroyed, as well as causing considerable damage in Hawaii, washing out a bridge along the Waiohi river.

EVTDESC21520;A major earthquake has struck San Francisco, California, today, causing widespread devastation and the loss of thousands of lives. Tremors have been reported as far away inland as Nevada, but as damaging as the earthquake and its aftershocks were, the fires that burned out of control afterward were even more destructive. Within three days, over 30 fires, caused by ruptured gas mains, destroyed approximately 25,000 buildings on 490 city blocks. Due to a widespread practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, most of the destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties, in order to claim them on their insurance. In all, the fires burned for four days and nights. Army units are hard at work bringing in supplies to the survivors, and we can rest assured that the quake will leave its mark on public memory for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

I suddenly saw that directly to the north, over Tunguska Road, the sky split in two and fire appeared high and wide over the forest. The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire northern side was covered with fire. From the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat. Then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, throwing me a few meters. I lost my senses for a moment, but then my wife ran out and led me to the house. After that such noise came, as if rocks were falling or cannons were firing and the earth shook. When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between the houses, like from cannons, which left traces in the ground like pathways, and it damaged some crops.

EVTDESC46610102;By 1895 $COUNTRY$ had had a dispute with a neighbor about the territory of Guayana Esequiba for over half a century.

The basis of the dispute is the advocacy of a particular division of the territory deriving from a mid-nineteenth-century survey commissioned by the country that owns Guyana. This division is known as the "Schomburgk Line", after the German naturalist who surveyed the territory. In October 1886 they declared the Line to be the provisional frontier of Guiana with $COUNTRY$, and in February 1887 $COUNTRY$ severed diplomatic relations. The discovery of gold in El Callao in $COUNTRY$ heated up the dispute, with several foreigners crossing the frontier to find gold. The situation changed after we obtained the services of William L.

EVT110030OPTB;Let's hear what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110031;Protests, Strikes and Fights;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110031;We have sent the troops again and again to quell the protests but the human waves seem endless. Now, everywhere in the country elites are demonstrating and striking. Reports of fights with the police arrive to our ears. In order to avoid the country slipping into anarchy, most regional commanders decided to have the army intervene. This, of course, only serve to further motivate the rebels. In the capital, the opposition  - led by bazaari and ulama once again - sought sanctuary in a mosque in Tehran. Forcing it would risk provoking popular support to their cause. In the meantime, southern tribes, bandits and armed groups tear our country apart, citing the protests as their motivation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110031OPTA;No one can hide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110031OPTB;Keep focusing on the insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110031OPTC;It's time for negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110032;Persecutions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110032;Orders have been given to all officers of the military apparatus: no quarter. We have to put down this rebellion before it gets out of hand. In the city, this means curfew and dispersing the crowds wherever they may appear - with the occasional victims of course. In the countryside... we have to be much more persuasive. You don't want the details $MONARCHTITLE$. Let's just say even the next generation will not dare raise against us. The Cossack Brigade has been particularly effective - maybe too much so: word is starting to get out of the country and our reputation is getting tarnished. If it's the price to pay... Or shall we slow down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110032OPTA;Grand Scale Massacre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110032OPTB;Surgical strikes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110033;Refugees in the Embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110033;Our leadership decided to cut the head of the snake. Sadly, the rampant incompetence and corruption of our administration let the word loose and the opposition's leaders sought refuge in a foreign Great Power embassy! The fields of the gigantic mansion are filled with tents where emissaries, clerics, businessmen and tribe leaders exchange, seemingly safe from our reach. We are assured that they are just fomenting their next move to strike us down! On the other hand, any actions would be perceived very badly and our diplomatic ties could suffer to the point of a war we may not afford. Foreign powers are offering us to step down in an obvious violation of sovereignty. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110033OPTA;Break down the gates. Seize the diplomats. Kill everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110033OPTB;It's time for negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110034;The Last March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110034;The rebels are spread too thin. We have showed times and times again that we are ready to keep our power and that none shall question it. Most of their leaders dead, their military efforts down and popular support slowly winding away. This is over. Our country can now step into the path of greatness that is rightfully yours. One last thing remains before we achieve our destiny. The remains of the opposition have decided for one last plea, one last effort and they're ready to pay for it with their life. They are going to march in the capital... A non-violent march on the siege of the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110034OPTA;Shoot! Shoot them all down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110034OPTB;It has gone too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110035;A New Majiles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110035;The opposition accepts to start negotiating with us and exposing their demands... at one condition. Before the negotiations even begin, they want the establishment of a untainted Majiles, a Parliament. They want their leaders to be nominated and that Parliament be given the right to oversee our regime's actions. They want their right to meet, exchange and discuss be respected. They want the location itself be deemed sacred and protected from any intervention of the police or the army. They want those demands to be unconditionally accepted and sworn on the Holy Book in front of entire population... This is dangerous. They are powerful and influent groups: refusing could lead us to unlimited repression but accepting means we cannot step back once we're in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110035OPTA;We have no choice but too accept...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110035OPTB;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110036;Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110036;Negotiating with the ulama appeared to be easy enough: in the grand scale of the Revolution, they agreed to let the other groups represent the secular interests. Their leaders thus worry about the spirituality of Persia and demand improvements. Not only do they want us to implement the Sharia Law at state level, but they demand to be in charge of its implementation. This could anger the more liberal rebels and cost a healthy sum of money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110036OPTA;Accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110036OPTB;Refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110037;Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110037;The bazaari's demands were simple enough: they want the possibility to translate their economic power on the political scene. For that purpose, they have elected to adopt the Western system of unions, which would allow them to organize in order to pressure the regime. Written word of the establishment and protection of this right has to be given to them, as well as a promise to raise the tariffs in order to better protect the national market. This doesn't sound well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110038;Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110038;The Socialists are hard at it but they're divided. While we ignored the more radicals, the so-called 'reformists' are open to discussion.

EVTNAME110039;Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110039;The liberals demands are quite simple: they want the freedom of press, the freedom of expression. They are convinced that, once those rights are achieved, everything else will come. Thus everything else comes second and they will become untouchable. While we laugh at their naivety, we must remember that they are one of the most influent group. But sacrificing our control of the media is a risky move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC110040;Now for the most delicate part of our duty: deal with the minorities. The recent troubles woke them up and they're ready to rise, would we make a bad move. They want autonomy, almost self-rule. Increased decentralization allied with added rights, giving them pressure on the regime would be an unprecedented move, one hard to revert. On the other hand, they are most certainly the most dangerous groups of them all: all our borderlands could unilaterally separate if we do not cave in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110041;Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110041;Some people joined the Revolution because they were convinced that the current regime doesn't represent the best interests of the nation. Those people want to see the foreigners kicked out and the country regain its independence. We could appease to the Nationalists by seizing foreign investments we have ignored in the past and effectively nationalizing it, but that would greatly anger other countries and put us at risk of an armed intervention...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC110042;A new era for the Orient begins. An era of Light, coming out of years of Darkness. An era in which Persia shall shine like the Sun.  After months of strikes, protests, demonstrations and even armed insurrections, our country is finally at peace. It is a new country for a world that is now reborn. The new 'Majiles' - the Parliament - worked hard, pushing negotiations on many issues against the central authority. Their fight ends now with he establishment of the so-called 'Constitution of $YEAR$'. Each faction elect their leaders, but the status-quo is fragile and window is open for a take-over. Who shall lead the Light?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110043;A New Capital For A New Persia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110043;After the end of those times of troubles, an idea has gained momentum in our leadership: to wholesomely represent the emergence of a new Persia, free of her burdens and unlike any that has been before, some propose to move our capital. Tehran has indeed seen much bloodshed in recent years and some of the infrastructure was damaged - including many government buildings. The idea is neat. Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110043OPTA;Tehran has served us well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110044;Disband the Persian Cossack Brigade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110044;With the end of the times of troubles comes the question of accountability. It appears the most bloody unit that took part in the repression was the Persian Cossack Brigade. Not only do they surpass everyone by the quantity, but also by the sheer intensity of their massacres. This comes as a shock as it used to be the most elite troop of the country but it seems like Caucasians have the thirst for bloodshed rushing through their veins. Now we have no choice but to disband it and put their leaders to trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110044OPTA;They cannot be forgiven, we won't take the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110060;The Bear Flag Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110060;In $YEAR$, a number of American immigrants in Alta California raised and rebelled against the local Mexican government before seizing military control the area to the north of the San Francisco Bay, in the present-day state of California. The immigrants had not been allowed to buy or rent land and had been threatened with expulsion because Mexican officials were concerned about the incoming influx of unregulated Americans in a climate of quickly rising tensions with the US. The term "California Republic" appeared on the flag the insurgents raised and indicated their aspiration of forming a republican government for California. The flag featured an image of a California grizzly bear and became known as the Bear Flag and the revolt as the Bear Flag Revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT110060OPTA;American saboteurs, that is all! Down with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC110062;Our situation is not that good. The treasury is low, the morale is down and everything is lacking, from ammunition to food supplies. Things could be better. Lesser men would have given up by now. But not us. Hope still remain, in our hearts and in our minds. Today, hope came in the form of a letter: an offer from the US government to join the glorious Union! Already, the troops are coming to take over our forts, on their way to Mexico, and senators in Washington are congratulating themselves. They have no doubts as to our answer and it seems like our destiny is already written.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA110062;We gladly accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC110063;Our letter was received today with cheer and joy in California as our brethren officially accepted the offer we sent before singing to the glory of the Union. The troops are taking over the forts and militias are joining our battalions while the Mexican army flees before us! This calls for a toast: to our Manifest Destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT110063OPTB;On second thought, let them be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME110064;California refused to join the Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110064;How dare they! Those we called our brothers declined our magnanimous offer to join us in glory! They called to their ridiculous flag, an absurd sense of "pride" for their barren lands, empty deserts and deadly mountains. This idiocy reveals what we should have realized a long time ago: they have become more Mexican than American! Thus, they shall share their fate.

EVTDESC110065;It seems like our brothers in California have become infatuated with the land... or the natives. Instead of making the right and obvious choice of accepting to join us in eternal glory, they came with a counter-offer. Ah! They want autonomy. They want the right to self-govern. They reject the federal government of Washington, a land they say, which is as far to them as Great-Britain was to our ancestors. This empty rhetoric is an obvious cover for ambitious and greedy local elites wanting to hoard power and wealth. Still, in the current situation, it could prove worthwhile... or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110053;Victorio is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110053;Victorio was a fierce warrior and chief of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh division of the central Apaches. For ten years, he and his band were moved to and left at least three different reservations, some more than once, despite his band's request to live on traditional lands. Wandering around the US-Mexico border, they were successful at raiding and evading capture by the military and even won a significant engagement at Las Animas Canyon before allegedly leading the Alma Massacre. In $YEAR$, while moving along the Rio Grande in northern Mexico, Victorio and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army in the Tres Castillos Mountains, in Chihuahua. He was, by all accounts, one of the greatest Apache military strategists to have ever lived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110073;The Golden Stool;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110073;When the new colonial governor to Ghana arrived in Kumasi with a small force of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers, he decided to deliver a speech to the Ashanti leaders. Talking about the need for submission by the locals, he mentioned one of their most sacred objects, ending like this: 'Why have you relegated me to this ordinary chair? Why did you not take the opportunity of my coming to Kumasi to bring the Golden Stool for me to sit upon?'. Not understanding the significance of the stool, he clearly had no inkling of the storm his words would produce: the suggestion that he, a foreigner, should sit upon and defile the Golden Stool, the very embodiment of the Ashanti state, and very symbol of the Ashanti peoples, living, dead, and yet to be born, was far too insufferable for the crowd. Now it is up to us to clean his mess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110081;The Paulet Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110081;Captain Lord George Paulet had become captain of HMS Carysfort in 1841, serving on the Pacific Station of the Royal Navy. While stationing in Honolulu, he quickly found himself in the middle of a feud between the British Consul Charlton and the Prime Minister of Hawaii, an American named Judd. The former claimed that British subjects in the Islands were being denied their legal rights: thus, when Paulet arrived at Honolulu he requested an audience with King Kamehameha III, tensions quickly rose between the locals, their American allies and the British elites - especially after Paulet militarily occupied the Islands. Each side is now sending envoys to defend themselves in the courts and the eyes of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110078;From Hell;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110078;Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in $YEAR$. Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. The "From Hell" letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee included half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as "Jack the Ripper", mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders and because of media treatment of the events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC110079;It was one of the Physicians-in-Ordinary to HM Queen Victoria, Sir William Withey Gull, 1st Baronet of Brook Street. It comes as a shocking news and a blow to the prestige of the Crown, but the evidences are undeniable. It seems the crimes could even lead to a higher conspiracy in the government incriminating the Freemasons! Some state that Gull caught syphilis in the West Indies while touring the world in his late teens and it was this illness that brought on a state of insanity which led to the murders.

EVTNAME110074;Coronation of Pedro II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110074;Dom Pedro II, nicknamed 'the Magnanimous', was the second ruler of the young Empire of Brazil. Born in Rio de Janeiro, he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza. His father's abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in order to restore his daughter on the throne of Portugal left a five-year-old Pedro II as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Still, he grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people -- on the other hand, he was increasingly resentful of his role as monarch. Inheriting an Empire on the verge of disintegration, he turned it into an emerging power with an important economic growth, distinguished from its neighbors on account of its political stability. Still, despite its overwhelming popular support, Pedro II quickly became weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110075;The death of Pedro II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110075;The support for the monarchy remained overwhelming in the country and none ever dreamed of having it otherwise. Pedro II was as popular as ever, a father for each of his citizens.  Still, letters he wrote reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. His last couple of years were lonely and melancholic and his health had considerably worsened. One day in $YEAR$, while residing in Paris, he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia Pedro rapidly declined and died surrounded by his family. His last words were 'May God grant me these last wishespeace and prosperity for Brazil!'. While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: 'It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110056;The H. L. Hunley;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110056;The H. L. Hunley was one of the first submarine built by the CSA, but named and mostly financed after its main inventor, Horace Lawson Hunley. It played a small but symbolic part in the American Civil War by demonstrating the advantages and dangers of undersea warfare. She was the first combat submarine to actually sink a warship, which was an important step in the naval arms-race going on at the time: indeed, the Yankees had also developed their first submarine, the USS Alligator, while the Confederation had already lost two prototypes. Our advisors believe that may be what gives us the vital edge we were looking for, especially against blockades. Shall we support the project?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC110057;The Hunley took off in the middle of the night on the order of Lieutenant George E. Dixon, desperate to break the naval blockade of the city. The boat had already sank two times before, killing 13 men, including Horace Hunley himself. But Dixon and a crew of seven volunteers successfully navigated the waters and aimed to reach the blockade. There, they spotted the USS Housatonic and began their approach. While the Yankees did see them, they were unable to fight back and the Hunley launched its torpedo swinging in the flank of the 1,260t vessel, sinking it in less than five minutes. The men then set for home and narrowly made it. Thus, the Hunley became the first submarine ship to successfully sink an enemy boat, marking History forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110050;Demokrasi Terpimpin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110050;Guided Democracy was the political system in place in Indonesia until the New Order began. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. He believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesia's situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme ('nationalism'), agama ('religion'), and komunisme ('communism') into a co-operative 'Nas-A-Kom' government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics  the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed, 'Guided Democracy' - western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the Reformasi era.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110051;Konfrontasi was a violent conflict that stemmed from Indonesia's opposition to the creation of Malaysia, the amalgamation of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore and the British protectorates of North Borneo and Sarawak. The confrontation was an undeclared war with most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo, also known as Kalimantan. Initial Indonesian attacks into East Malaysia relied heavily on local volunteers trained by the Indonesian Army before launching an expanded campaign of operations into West Malaysia.

EVTDESC110054;Le avventure di Pinocchio is a novel for children written in Florence by Italian author Carlo Collodi. The first half was originally a serial in 1881 and 1882, and then later completed as a book for children in February 1883. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio and his father, a poor woodcarver named Geppetto. It is considered a canonical piece of children's literature and has inspired hundreds of adaptations, from new editions or stage plays to movies, and has been translated in over 240 languages worldwide, making it among the most widely read books ever written.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC16459;After fairly favorable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters, which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the prairies region in $COUNTRY$ entered an unusually dry era in the summer of $YEAR$. During the drought of the 1930s, the unanchored soil turned to dust, which the prevailing winds blew away in huge clouds that sometimes blackened the sky. These choking billows of dust  named "black blizzards" or "black rollers"  traveled cross country, reaching as far as the East Coast and striking such cities as New York City and Washington, D.C.\nOn the Plains, they often reduced visibility to 1 meter (3.3 ft) or less.

EVTDESC16180;During the most intense days of the slavery debate, some abolitionists organized emigration to the territories of Kansas and Nebraska in order to prevent these territories from being admitted into the Union as slave-states. The theory of popular sovereignty held that a democratic vote in the state would decide on whether the state should be constituted as slave or free.

He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ for this and other work on the discontinuous structure of matter, which put a definite end to the long struggle regarding the question of the physical reality of molecules. Officially, his award mentions "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter, and especially for his discovery of sedimentation equilibrium".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23475;The Twenty-fourth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23475;Two $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientists developed an experiment, which took their name, and that was the first electrical measurement to clearly show the quantum nature of atoms and thus "transformed our understanding of the world". They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapor of mercury atoms. They discovered that, when an electron collided with a mercury atom, it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9 electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. This energy loss corresponds to decelerating the electron from a speed of about 1.3 million meters per second to zero. A faster electron doesn't decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy. In $YEAR$ they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23474;The Twenty-third Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23474;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements. He developed a convention for naming the different spectral lines that are characteristic to elements in X-ray spectroscopy that gained his name. His precision measurements drove many developments in quantum theory and atomic physics and "for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy" he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23473;The Twenty-second Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23473;Starting in 1908, while a professor at the University of $CAPITAL$, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ professor worked on an oil-drop experiment in which he measured the charge on a single electron. Previously, another scientist already discovered the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. However, the actual charge and mass values were unknown. Therefore, if one of these two values were to be discovered, the other could easily be calculated. He and his then graduate student used an oil-drop experiment to measure the charge of the electron (as well as the electron mass, and Avogadro's number, since their relation to the electron charge was known) and in $YEAR$, "for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect", he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23472;The Twenty-first Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23472;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist developed a model of the atom which takes his name, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analyzed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated his thinking in both science and philosophy. In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23471;The Twentieth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23471;Based on calculations a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity. In 1919 that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science  New Theory of the Universe  Newtonian Ideas Overthrown". In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", as his theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23470;The Nineteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23470;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist discovered a nickel-steel alloys he named invar and elinvar. Invar has a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion, making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature. Elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the modulus of elasticity, making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature, such as the marine chronometer. Elinvar is also non-magnetic, which is a secondary useful property for anti-magnetic watches. His work got him a Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$, "in recognition of the service he has rendered to precision measurements in Physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23469;A well accomplished $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist, that published more than 300 papers, mainly regarding electricity and other such topics, discovered an effect that got his namesake and that is described as "the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to presence of an external electric field". Additionally, "for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields" he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23468;The Seventeenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23468;At first, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist considered that quantization was only "a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it...", nowadays this assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of his career. The discovery of the constant that was named after him enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the length and the mass, both named after hi,), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of his fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, Quantum Physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$, officially "in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME23465;The Fifteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23465;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist at the University of $CAPITAL$, working with X-rays, invented the X-ray spectrometer and with his son, a research student at $CAPITAL$, founded the new science of X-ray crystallography - a tool used for identifying the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds, their disorder and various other information. Together with his son he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23464;The Fourteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23464;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, on a walk through a garden in $CAPITAL$ in January, was discussing with a PhD student about the student's thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to the student were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence much larger than the spacing between the resonators in his crystal model. The physicist seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, they reported to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Physics Society on the successful diffraction of x-rays, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in $YEAR$, "for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23463;The Thirteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23463;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist exploited the Hampson-Linde cycle to investigate how materials behave when cooled to nearly absolute zero. On 10 July 1908, he was the first to liquefy helium, using several precooling stages and the Hampson-Linde cycle based on the Joule-Thomson effect. This way he lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium (-269 °C, 4.2 K). By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved a temperature near 1.5 K, the coldest temperatures ever achieved on earth. His production of extreme cryogenic temperatures led to his discovery of superconductivity in 1911: for certain materials, electrical resistance abruptly vanishes at very low temperatures. His work was recognized with the award of the thirteenth Nobel Prize In Physics "for his investigations on the properties of matter at low temperatures which led, inter alia, to the production of liquid helium" in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23462;The Twelfth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23462;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ inventor working with acetylene invented Agamassan (Aga), a substrate used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white-light and immediately superseded the duller-flamed LPG as the fuel of choice in lighthouse illuminations. He developed a light that bears his name, which incorporated another invention, the 'sun valve', a device that allowed the light to operate only at night. His 'Flasher' was a device that, except for a small pilot light, only consumed gas during the flash stage, reducing gas consumption by more than 90%. To a rugged coastal area like Scandinavia, his mass-produced, minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood and AGA Lighthouses eventually covered the entire Panama Canal. In $YEAR$, "for his invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys", he was awarded the twelfth Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23461;The Eleventh Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23461;While studying streams of ionized gas, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, in 1898, identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom. This particle was accepted and named the proton. He also formulated an expression for the black-body radiation which is correct in the photon-gas limit. His arguments were based on the notion of adiabatic invariance, and were instrumental for the formulation of a field some scientists are calling quantum mechanics. In $YEAR$, "for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat", he was awarded the eleventh Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23460;The Tenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23460;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, in his dissertation "On the continuity of the gas and liquid state", derived the equation of state bearing his name. His work gave a model in which the liquid and the gas phase of a substance merge into each other in a continuous manner. It shows that the two phases are of the same nature. In deriving his equation of state, he assumed not only the existence of molecules (a disputed topic) but also that they are of finite size and attract each other, one of the first scientists to postulate an intermolecular force. His work was recognized and in $YEAR$ he was awarded the tenth Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23459;The Ninth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23459;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ inventor conducting experiments, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home with the help of his butler. His goal: to use radio waves to create a practical system of "wireless telegraphy"  i.e. the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the electric telegraph. This was not a new idea  numerous investigators had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. He used a spark-gap transmitters plus coherer-receivers, similar configurations that had been tried by others, but many were unable to achieve transmission ranges of more than a few hundred meters. His, however, proved successful and together with another scientist in $YEAR$ he was awarded the Ninth Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23458;The Eighth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23458;On 2 February 1891, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, interested in a method of fixing the colors of the solar spectrum on a photographic plate, announced to the Academy of Sciences: "I have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colors on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration." By April 1892, he was able to report that he had succeeded in producing color images of a stained glass window, a group of flags, a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a multicolored parrot. He presented his theory of color photography using the interference method in two papers to the Academy, one in 1894, the other in 1906 and for "for his method of reproducing colors photographically based on the phenomenon of interference" he was awarded the Eighth Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23457;The Seventh Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23457;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Midshipman, fascinated with the sciences and the problem of measuring the speed of light in particular, conducted his first experiments of the speed of light, as part of a class demonstration in 1877. His experiment was refined, and in 1879, he measured the speed of light in air to be 299,864 ± km/s and estimated the speed of light in vacuum as 299,940 km/s. After two years of studies in Europe, he resigned from the Navy in 1881. In 1883 he accepted a position as professor of physics at the University of $CAPITAL$ and concentrated on developing an improved interferometer. In 1887 he carried out an experiment which seemed to rule out the existence of the aether. He later moved on to use astronomical interferometers in the measurement of stellar diameters and in measuring the separations of binary stars. Finally, in $YEAR$, he won the seventh Nobel Prize in Physics "for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23456;The Sixth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23456;"As the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in which this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving along the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter... If, in the very intense electric field in the neighborhood of the cathode, the molecules of the gas are dissociated and are split up, not into the ordinary chemical atoms, but into these primordial atoms, which we shall for brevity call corpuscles, and if these corpuscles are charged with electricity and projected from the cathode by the electric field, they would behave exactly like the cathode rays". In $YEAR$ a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist was nominated and won the Sixth Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23451;The First Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23451;During last year a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist was investigating the external effects from the various types of vacuum tube equipment when an electrical discharge is passed through them, speculating that a new kind of ray might be possible. He ate and slept in his laboratory as he investigated many properties of the new rays he temporarily termed "X-rays", using the mathematical designation ("X") for something unknown. In $YEAR$ he published his paper, "On A New Kind Of Rays", and the new rays came to bear his name in many languages. For his discovery he was nominated and subsequently was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23453;"One wraps a photographic plate with a bromide emulsion in two sheets of very thick black paper, such that the plate does not become clouded upon being exposed to the sun for a day. One places on the sheet of paper, on the outside, a slab of the phosphorescent substance, and one exposes the whole to the sun for several hours. When one then develops the photographic plate, he recognizes that the silhouette of the phosphorescent substance appears in black on the negative. If one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen pierced with a cut-out design, he sees the image of these objects appear on the negative. One must conclude from these experiments that the phosphorescent substance in question emits rays which pass through the opaque paper and reduce silver salts."

EVTNAME23454;The Fourth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23454;On $YEAR$ a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ professor of the $CAPITAL$ University was giving a lecture in which he pointed out that nitrogen isolated from the air had a density slightly higher than that of nitrogen prepared from chemical sources. A liter of pure nitrogen gas generated from a chemical reaction weighed 1.2505 g. On the other hand, a liter of nitrogen gas generated from air by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor weighed 1.2572 g (at the same temperature and pressure). He thought that there might be an unrecognized new element hiding in the air, and that there might be room for this in a new Group at the end of the Periodic Table. When examinations had finished, he set about attempting to isolate this 'impurity' and "for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of argon in connection with these studies" he was awarded the fourth Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23455;The Fifth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23455;In $YEAR$ a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist was awarded the Fifth Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on cathode rays". Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive, partially evacuated glass tubes that had metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage could be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study using this arrangement, because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. Lenard overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME110020;Tobacco Protest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC110020;On $YEAR$, the Shah granted foreigners a concession over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for fifty years. In exchange, they paid the Shah an annual sum plus a share of the profits. A Tobacco Régie (monopoly) was subsequently established and all the producers and owners of tobacco were forced to sell their goods to agents of the Régie, who would then resell the purchased tobacco. The concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and bazaaris whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business. Mass protests against the Régie began to emerge in major Iranian cities, spearheaded by the bazaari. The ulema proved to be a highly valuable ally of them as key religious leaders sought to defend traditional values and protect national interests from foreign domination. The brewing discontent threatens to rip our country apart, but giving in to their demands might have even more serious consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000¤ into his Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home."

This arrangement caused dissatisfaction among the people of Neuchatel, and in $YEAR$, when the Swiss were revising their constitution and when France, Germany, Austria, and Italy were all being shaken by revolutionary movements, a successful insurrection established a republic there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as it could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. It began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as its angle in the water became steeper. Ships in $YEAR$ were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels so Titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board.

This was during the tumultuous Napoleonic period when the Bourbon court was forced to escape from Naples and set up its royal court in Palermo with the assistance of the English navy. The Sicilian nobles were able to take the opportunity to force on the Bourbons a new constitution for Sicily that was based on the Westminster system of parliamentary government, and was in fact quite a liberal constitution for the time. However, post Congress of Vienna, Ferdinand IV of Naples (and III of Sicily) immediately abolished the constitution upon returning the royal court to Naples. The 1848 revolution was substantially organized from, and centered in, Palermo. The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred.

EVTDESC232000000;I saw, about four miles to the left, a sheet of water, which ultimately proved to be a creek and the southernmost part of what the Arabs call the Ukerewe Sea. Convinced that I finally found the source of the Nile, I went down a grassy and jungly depression into a deep, dirty, viscid nullah, which communicated with the southern end of the creek, which we named Jordan. As we followed the creek, that increased in breadth as it extended northwards, we saw many little islands in Ukerewe, well wooded, standing boldly out of the water. The journey continued through another tortuous day until we reached the village of Isamiro, where the view was clearer and better. In the distant horizon a calm sea line started to appear between north and west. Even in a well known country the view would have attracted attention for its placid beauty, he thought to himself.

EVTDESC441277;The early days of Liberia were marked by constant frontier troubles with the French on the Ivory Coast and the British at Sierra Leone. The Liberians tried to extend their authority inland, although they were still unable to control all of the coastal area they claimed.

EVTDESC441266;In 1820, the American Colonization Society (ACS) began sending African American volunteers to the Pepper Coast to establish a colony for freed African Americans. The ACS, a private organization supported by prominent American politicians such as Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, and James Monroe, believed repatriation was preferable to emancipation of slaves, and they founded a colony on what is known as Liberia. The colony of Liberia was poor and economically dependent on the ACS, resulting that by the 1840s, the ACS was effectively bankrupt: Liberia had become a financial burden for it. When the American Colonization Society intimated that Liberia should cease its dependency on it, Joseph Roberts, the colony first black governor, proclaimed it an independent republic in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The natives of Bahr el Ghazal paid tribute to Darfur, and these were the chief articles of merchandise sold by the Darfurians to the Egyptian traders along the road to Asyut. Al-Zubayr redirected this flow of goods to Khartoum and the Nile with his conquest of South Sudan.

In the east Muhammad Ahmad al-Aqqad controlled much land, but the most powerful was Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur who came to control the Bahr el Ghazal and other parts of South Sudan. Al-Zubayr was a merchant from Khartoum, who hired his own private army and marched south. He set up a network of trading forts known as zaribas through the region, and from these forts controlled local trade. To manage the trade al-Zubayr needed labor, and thus also began to capture a significant number of slaves.

Many of the Kalanga people were incorporated and the rest were made satellite territories who paid tribute to the Ndebele Kingdom. He called his new nation Mthwakazi, a Zulu word which means something which became big at conception, in Zulu "into ethe ithwasa yabankulu" but the territory was called Matabeleland by Europeans. Mzilikazi organized this ethnically diverse nation into a militaristic system of regimental towns and established his capital at Bulawayo ("the place of killing"). Mzilikazi was a statesman of considerable stature, able to weld the many conquered tribes into a strong, centralized kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to Wahhabi pressure, Senussi left Mecca and settled in Cyrenaica in 1843, where in the mountains near Sidi Rafaa' he built the Zawia Baida (White Monastery).' The Senussi are a Muslim political-religious Sufi order and tribe in Cyrenaica. They claim a direct lineage to the Prophet Muhammad and are concerned with both the decline of Islamic thought and spirituality and the weakening of Muslim political integrity. The power of the current Grand Senussi, Sayyid Muhammad al-Mahdi bin Sayyid Muhammad as-Senussi, grew to the point that it made the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime uneasy.

In 1830, France invaded and occupied the coastal areas of Algeria, citing a diplomatic incident as casus belli. Hussein Dey, the last Ottoman regent of Algiers, went into exile. \n Soon after the conquest of Algiers, the soldier-politician Bertrand Clauzel and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and, despite official discouragement, to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, triggering a land rush. Clauzel recognized the farming potential of the Mitidja Plain and envisioned the production there of cotton on a large scale.

They established a blend of religious and secular rule in parts of Yemen in 897 and now the Rassid dynasty ruled for almost a millennium. However, the power of the imamate declined in the 18th and 19th century. The territory controlled by the imams shrank successively after the late 17th century, and the lucrative coffee trade declined with new producers in other parts of the world. The imamate became a "quasi-state" with an inherent tension between tribes and government, and between tribal culture and learned Islamic morality. The imams themselves adopted the style of Middle East monarchies, becoming increasingly distant figures. As a result, they lost their charismatic and spiritual position among the tribes of Yemen.

EVTDESC36965;We outlawed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ slave trade many years ago, but it continues in many African nations -- and the coastal city of Lagos in particular. Lagos has been a haven for slavers, providing unwilling natives to the trade on markets in defiance of all decent conventions.

EVTDESC36970;With the 'International Commission for the Piercing of the Isthmus of Suez' having completed and assessed the Suez region as being possible to have a canal built, all that remains is to put the plan in motion. The Suez Canal Company intends to do just that, but in order for it to start it needs to put together a significant amount of capital -- thus it has been offering shares to our government, hoping as well for the political clout to influence Egypt into allowing the venture to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC36973;The Suez Canal, slated to be inaugurated soon, had a line of ships spending the night in line to cross the canal.

When dawn broke our officials were horrified to find that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Navy was first in line and that it would be impossible to pass them. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ captain received both an official reprimand and an unofficial vote of thanks from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Admiralty for his actions in promoting $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and for demonstrating such superb seamanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC36975;We have received disturbing reports of rebellion in Egypt, on a scale where our interests in the Suez might become threatened.

EVTNAME36979;The Construction of the Panama Canal is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36979;The Canal cut through mountains and had to continually be widened, and the mountains slopes reduced, to minimize landslides into the canal. Steam shovels had been invented but were still not enough. Other mechanical and electrical equipment were limited in its capabilities and steel equipment rusted rapidly in the tropical climate. Several health risks posed a threat to workers in the mosquito-infested Panamanian jungle, principally malaria and yellow fever, and it claimed thousands of lives. Conditions were downplayed in $COUNTRY$ to avoid recruitment problems, but the high mortality made it difficult to maintain an experienced workforce. \n Finally, on $YEAR$ the Panama Canal was finished and it will be open to business.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36979OPTA;This will surely help our power projection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36982;Our recent conquest of Suez led us to take over the construction of the Suez Canal.

EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident.

He was sent in 1853 as minister plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, and spent a year and a half in Europe. He purchased large quantities of arms and military supplies, together with several steamers, and organized a project for building a railroad and establishing a French colony in Paraguay. He also became infatuated with the empire of Napoleon III and with Napoleon Bonaparte himself. López equipped his army with exact copies of uniforms of Napoleonic army.

EVTNAME97674;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe.

EVTNAME97600;Sakoku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97601;Rangaku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima.

The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku -- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97620;The Death of Iesada;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi -- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97620OPTA;We will support the tozama and make Yoshinobu shogun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97620OPTB;The fudai are Tokugawa allies. Iemochi will be shogun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97621;Tokugawa Yoshinobu is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97623;Tokugawa Iemochi is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun -- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama.

Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97623OPTA;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada.

EVTDESC95260;With the end of the democratic government of the United States, there is a growing feeling among many Americans that the principles upon which the country were founded no longer apply. Talk of secession is frequent, if quiet, and as unrest begins to grow it's become increasingly more possible that liberal-minded states will attempt to pull out of the Union. If they do, we must be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether we can move fast enough to ensure those states never act upon the declaration, or whether others will heed the call of these so-called 'Free States' remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Oregon Country is a land where men achieve their destiny through honest toil and while believing in the equality of men. Since the Union no longer believes in the same, we hereby declare it dead.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Portland have declared the secession of Oregon from the Union.

That is what we do here today: we are forging a new alliance of equals, brothers with a common heritage who will never forget the evils that lie in tyranny and corruption.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Chicago have declared the formation of a 'New American Alliance'. The state of Illinois has seceded from the Union to create it, and it's entirely possible that others will join them if we do not act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Already an army of supporters is gathering in Austin, ready to fight against any reprisal from Washington.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return.

Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia.

Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.

This move would allow $COUNTRY$ to try to further a trading relationship by sending a ship to the United States.

EVTNAME98205;Invasion of the Laagers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$  rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98205OPTA;We must drive them from our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98205OPTB;There is no choice but to appease them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98206;The Battle of Blood River;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony -- with the only question remaining whether the $COUNTRY_ADJ$  will recognize their independence or continue to treat them as subjects of the crown. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98206OPTA;They are colonial subjects, no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98206OPTB;The Boers will stand on their own, if they can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98207;The Natalia Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are $COUNTRY_ADJ$  subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98207OPTB;Allow them to find their own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98210;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Rule of Natal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are once again chafing under $COUNTRY_ADJ$  rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they have not escaped the $COUNTRY_ADJ$  crown. There have been several altercations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$  military forces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way -- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98210OPTA;We will annex the Natal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98212;The Annexation of Natalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the British government that Natalia be annexed into the Cape Colony. For all our struggles to leave the British behind, they yet follow us and refuse to allow us independence!

EVTNAME98215;The Orange River Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98215;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Basotho.

EVTDESC98227;With 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave $PROVINCENAME$ behind and establish new homes outside of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. The Dorsland Trek (Thirstland Trek) was the collective name of a series of explorations undertaken by Boer settlers to South-West Africa rather than to the Orange Free State and the South African Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98230;Sand River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98230;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the 'unethical' treatment of foreigners working in our territory ('uitlanders', as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98235;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Johannesburg', on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place.

EVTNAME98236;Kimberley Gold Rush;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas -- who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98245;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrassing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98245OPTA;They will submit, or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next.

EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Cape Town already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Boers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT98248OPTA;That's good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98249;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone of the talks has been very bitter, and it's clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government will do all it can to return and trouble us again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98250;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced.

EVTNAME98255;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98255OPTA;This is beyond the pale!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT98260OPTA;A fine idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98260OPTB;It's not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98261;The Northern Cape Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98261;Many British settlers are pushing north of the Cape Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government.

EVTNAME85000;Catholics Slain in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux -- head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church -- and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessel which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea -- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85000OPTA;This cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries -- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence.

Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless.

EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants -- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force -- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98626OPTA;Order must be restored. Abrogate the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98630;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98630OPTA;This cannot be permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98635;The Young Turks;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the constitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98635OPTA;We cannot allow them to spread unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98635OPTB;Let them talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98636;Turkish Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy -- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98636OPTA;This is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98640;End of the Ottoman Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place. The concept of Ottomanism, an Empire formed of diverse cultures and religions, has been set aside in favor of a nation built by and for the Turkish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97500;Sovereign Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97500OPTA;Russia protects the Holy Land, not France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97500OPTB;We will agree to the French demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97501;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Our Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97501OPTA;Pressure them into accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97501OPTB;Abandon our claim before this goes further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97502;French Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97502OPTA;We must give in to the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97502OPTB;Never! Let them come, if they dare!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97503OPTA;We are the protectors of Eastern Christians, not the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places -- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97504OPTA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97505;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97505OPTA;This will surely lead to trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97506OPTA;We intend to stay out of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97506OPTB;We will protect our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97507;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet -- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97507OPTA;A dark day for the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97507OPTB;Never! There is still a chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current war goals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97508OPTA;We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97508OPTB;We refuse. The war continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97509;The Russians Have Accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97509;The Russians have agreed to lay down arms. Now comes the difficult part: discovering how they wish to punish us with the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97509OPTA;A great relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97512OPTA;There shall be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97510;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail) and that we will renounce our claims in the area. Other demands are that we cede the territory of the Åland Islands to Finland as demilitarized zone. Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97510OPTA;Give them Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97510OPTB;Never! They will have to take it from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97511;Stand Down;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97511;The Ottomans have surrendered to the Russians. There is no need for our war to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97511OPTA;It's about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97515;Romanian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our independence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97515OPTA;We shall declare our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97515OPTB;No, it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97516OPTA;We will assist the Romanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97516OPTB;We are not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97518;The Russians Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97518;We have received word from the Russian government: they have refused to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97520;Romania Is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME95610;The Great Game;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95610;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95611;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion.

EVTNAME95612;The Great Game Comes To $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between.

EVTNAME95613;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Border Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its maneuvering, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC37219_NEW;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In Dai Nam, the execution of several missionaries has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention.

EVTDESC37230;The island of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, ruled by the primitive Queen Pomare IV," expelled two French catholic priests several years ago. Admiral Abel Aubert Dupetit-Thouars was dispatched to get reparations for the deed, but then proceeded -- without authorization -- to gain a request from the Queen's chiefs to request a protectorate", a treaty to which he then demanded the Queen acquiesce. We can approve the treaty, gaining use of Tahiti as a staging ground in the Pacific, but it may cause friction with the British Empire considering British colonists are also on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME10400;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10400;The unrest in France hit its height recently, with crowds streaming through the streets of Paris and erecting barricades. In what was widely regarded as an accident, a French guardsmen fired his musket on the citizens and set off a massacre. The resulting conflagration has swept the city, with crowds chanting 'Long live the Reform!' and 'Down with the King!'. Despite assurances that everything is under control, the king has abdicated and fled the country leaving a provisional government to step in and declare the Second Republic. \n \n Now we have the task of building this new government, starting with a presidential election to determine its new Head of State. Considering the popularity of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte among the masses, and the granting of universal voting rights, some are say that he may in fact take the leadership.

EVTDESC10401;While it was expected that Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte would do well in the French presidential election, no one could have counted on the fact that he has done as well as this. Despite his autocratic leanings and lack of allies in Paris, he has managed to be something to everyone even gaining the sponsorship of the Orleanists. The provisional government's candidate, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, led the effort to quell an uprising in the city -- leading to resentment among the masses which has translated into Napoleon's landslide. Many fear the man takes too much after his infamous uncle, and thus the idea has arisen of fixing the elections to ensure Cavaignac's victory. This would require us to restrict universal suffrage, as well as muffle the newspapers and political opponents. Either way, the ideals of the Second Republic seem at risk of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France. All around Europe, countries are reacting to the news negatively, fearing a revival of the old Napoleonic goals.

Proponents of laissez-faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise.

EVTDESC1010021;We've received reports that the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been active in $PROVINCENAME$, spreading propaganda and generally stirring up agitation against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.

EVTDESC1010023;In an event organized by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a group of Irish nationalists seized key locations in the city of $PROVINCENAME$ on Easter Monday, kicking off the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME1010024;The Sinn Féin Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war... but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all... now on our terms, rather than on theirs. The suggestion is that Ireland remain an autonomous Dominion under our control, with any regions that wish to opt out of the new state and remain part of $COUNTRY$ able to do so. Others suggest this is unworkable, and we should either simply release them and keep them as allies or annex them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME1010030;Charles Stewart Parnell;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent -- able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It's very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state -- one dominated by Irish Catholics in Dublin.

EVTNAME1010032;Irish Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who -- in the not-too-distant past -- might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable. \n \n Now we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way, this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT1010032OPTA;Pass the bill and give them Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O'Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda. Without him, it appears unlikely that the Irish Republican movement will gain the political clout it requires to attempt another passing of the Home Rule Bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT1010033OPTA;Unfortunate. For the Irish, I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90050;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move.

EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new constitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC90054;The arrogant German aristocrats in Holstein have declared they intend to pursue a future with the German Confederation to the south, and consider Schleswig an indivisible part of their territory. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ militants are angrily calling for the military to step in, though some fear this may lead to war with the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME95250;The White Rajah;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95250;Brunei's control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, and the region has been self-governed under the Sultan of Sarawak. During a recent crisis, an Englishman by the name of James Brooke provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order, and has been bestowed with the title of governor. This 'White Rajah' is now effectively the ruler, and is seeking alliance with Brunei.

EVTNAME90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90069OPTA;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability, though it is clear they are angered by the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90071OPTA;They will pay for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90071OPTB;We have no desire to push this further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900700;Giving Up Cyprus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900700;We are called upon to live up to our part of the bargain and give up Cyprus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900700OPTA;We will abide by our agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900700OPTB;Their help was worthless! Forget it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900701;The Cyprus Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900701;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to live up to its part of the bargain and hand over Cyprus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900701OPTA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900702;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Reneges;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900702;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has reneged on its deal to give up Cyprus. They claim our aid at the Congress wasn't worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900702OPTA;Then we shall take it whether they like it or not!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900702OPTB;It's not worth fighting over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900705;The Bosnian Stewardship;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900705;The Congress has agreed to our demands regarding Bosnia. They are to be placed under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900705OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME900710;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Allies;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900710;$FROMCOUNTRY$ received a great deal of benefit from the recent Congress of great powers, and it was decided that $COUNTRY$ deserves great influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as compensation -- if we want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900710OPTA;Absolutely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900710OPTB;We have no interest in influencing $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900711;$FROMCOUNTRY$ received a great deal of benefit from the recent Congress of great powers, and it was decided that $COUNTRY$ deserves considerable influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as compensation -- if we want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900712;Influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900712;$FROMCOUNTRY$ received a great deal of benefit from the recent Congress of great powers, and it was decided that $COUNTRY$ deserves considerable some small influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as compensation -- if we want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900715;Legacy of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900715;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ delegates were sent to the recent Congress -- reasonable considering it was the fate of our country and the entire Balkans that was being decided, or so we thought. As it turns out, the great powers of Europe decided what was to become of $COUNTRY$ without our participation, and while we received some benefit it has come to us at a price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900715OPTA;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME152009872;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership -- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective. And it seems many of the men under their command agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009872OPTA;This could mean trouble down the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME152009873;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Military Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009873;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ army forces in $CAPITAL$ have made their way toward the government buildings -- not to protect the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as is their duty, but instead to oust our leaders and install themselves as $COUNTRY$'s new rulers. They claim that $COUNTRY$ is in a state of 'upheaval', and only the army can restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009873OPTA;The army shall rule $COUNTRY$ for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009873OPTB;We will not stand for military rule in $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them -- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95639OPTA;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95640;Persecution of French Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95640OPTA;Demand Cochinchina, or it is war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95640OPTB;We will continue on the diplomatic path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95641OPTA;Turn over Cochinchina. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95641OPTB;They are a paper tiger. Let them come, if they dare.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95642;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95642;The rulers of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have foolishly refused our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95642OPTA;Then war it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95645;The Suzerainty of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95645OPTA;Ask for Foreign protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95645OPTB;Throw out the Thai! We will risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95646;The King of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the Foreigners intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the Foreigners and asked for protection, and the Foreigners have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95646OPTA;Demand Cambodia from the Vietnamese.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95646OPTB;Cambodia is on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95647OPTA;Surrender Cambodia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95647OPTB;This cannot be permitted!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95648;Dai Nam Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95648;Dai Nam has refused to surrender Cambodia to us. It seems we have little choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95648OPTA;War it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95649;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95649;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused to intervene. It seems we are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95649OPTA;Then we declare our freedom. We shall risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95649OPTB;Then we do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95650;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbors. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95650OPTA;It remains a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95650OPTB;This is not in our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95650OPTC;Never bring this up again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95652;$FROMCOUNTRY$ diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the $FROMCOUNTRY$ claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95652OPTA;We have no choice. Surrender the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95652OPTB;Never! They will have to take it from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ stubbornly refuses to relinquish hold over its conquered lands. It falls on us to protect these unfortunates by use of force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95653OPTA;A foolish move.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95654;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95654;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has bowed before our demand. Good relations have been restored..;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95654OPTA;A wise move.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95655;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$$ onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$$ at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95655OPTA;Give them what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95655OPTB;That will solve nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95656;The Dai Viet Emperor Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95656;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us a state as concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95656OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95657;The Dai Viet Emperor has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95657;The Dai Viet have refused to submit. Apparently they will fight until the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95657OPTA;An unfortunate choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME185;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Prohibition?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC185;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been increasingly active in one of our states this year, with a campaign to harass local public houses and liquor merchants. Many of their more politically-minded members have even approached members of the government in $CAPITAL$, pushing for greater support for their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT185OPTA;Support the movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT185OPTB;Nonsense. They take this too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME186;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Libertines;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC186;The libertine culture in $COUNTRY$ has drawn criticism, with news of a scandal that reaches to the very heights of government. Several ministers are accused of unsavory dealings, and there are calls in $CAPITAL$ for the government to support religious groups in their calls for moderation and temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT186OPTA;There is no need for such action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT186OPTB;Some restraint is best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18210;The Right to Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTA;Let the bill pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTB;That will cause too many problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTC;Don't bring this up again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18215;Party Loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$. They've succeeded in gathering enough clout to pass a bill strengthening the power of the party whips, and ensuring that the party's influence in the government remains absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18215OPTA;We must have unity in the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18215OPTB;No. Let the government rule as it desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18220;The Right to Information;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18225;The Right to Gather;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated -- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18225OPTA;They are right. We cannot abide this sort of rabble-rousing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18225OPTB;No, the rules shall stay as they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18230;Rights of the Opposition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98600;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98600OPTA;We will make the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98600OPTB;There is no point.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98605;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion -- and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98605OPTA;Grant $FROMCOUNTRY$ its freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98605OPTB;Refuse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98606;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion -- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98606OPTA;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98607;$COUNTRY$ Granted Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98607OPTA;We are most fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98608;It appears the threat of a war of independence was enough to secure $COUNTRY$'s freedom. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence -- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98610OPTA;Then it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98610OPTB;We shall let them go. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98611;Must We Fight Alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98611OPTA;Attempt to find allies... quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98611OPTB;There is no need for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98612;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98612OPTA;Agree to the alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98612OPTB;No, this is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98613;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98613;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our secret alliance. Whether they will indeed help once the war begins remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98613OPTA;It gives us hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98614;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98614;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our request. Hopefully they don't inform our overlords of our intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98614OPTA;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90075;The Fate of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90075OPTA;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90076;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride. \n \n §RNOTE: In case of war, you need to enforce the "Make Puppet" CB on Egypt to inherit it.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90076OPTA;Egypt is part of the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90076OPTB;We are willing to negotiate a settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90077;Negotiations with the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90077OPTA;We agree to the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90077OPTB;Never! We reject all Ottoman influence in Egypt!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90078;Egypt Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine -- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90078OPTA;This is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90079;Egypt Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90079OPTA;So must it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90080;The Egyptian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90080OPTA;Glory to Egypt!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90081;Egypt Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90081;We have brought Egypt to its knees and restored Ottoman rule to the area. Now we must decide whether to be gracious and allow them to retain autonomy, while restricting their land and power, or whether to rule all of Egypt directly and face the possibility of rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90081OPTA;Restrict their lands and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90081OPTB;We shall rule them directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90082;Rebellion Against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90082;An uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ has gained popularity throughout the region, spreading the unrest throughout all of $STATENAME$. Local authorities have moved swiftly in an attempt to keep the violence contained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90082OPTA;Put down the uprising at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90083;Anger Over Egyptian Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms and there are fears that if they are not satisfied they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90083OPTA;We will give in to their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90083OPTB;The government will not submit to reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90084;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair -- instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90085;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90087;The Fall of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands.

EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control.

EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now.

Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90093OPTA;We withdraw our support of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90093OPTB;We will not back down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90094;Egypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced. We can let the matter lie, or fight for both our stake in Egypt and our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME800147;Sepoy Rebels Force Concessions;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800147;The Indian subcontinent has been overwhelmed by the Sepoy rebels. Our garrisons are in retreat, and our colonial governors have already fled for safer ports.

EVTDESC800148;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in our region has come to an end, thanks to the spread of the Sepoy Rebellion.

EVTDESC800149;After a swarm of violence and looting that engulfed the entire nation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rioters have stormed the capital. The government has been forced to make numerous concessions, in a desperate bid to calm the people. So far it seems to have worked, and has spared many leaders from being executed by angry mobs, but it remains to be seen whether these concessions will only cause more problems in the end than they solved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97561;Rebels in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$.

EVTNAME97562;$CAPITAL$ Burns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties -- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97566;Trouble in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97566;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$.

EVTNAME97570;Native Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97570;Now that $COUNTRY$ is free, native $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens are beginning to protest against the colonial regime that still remains. Foreigners still hold the highest positions in the government, and have a privileged status in comparison to those they once ruled over as a colony.

EVTNAME17710;Communist Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17710;Communists have been distributing literature among the working classes in one of our states. They are claiming that the common man needs to rise up against the 'bourgeois' class, and that rule by the workers is the only way they can obtain fair conditions and a truly utopian society. Government officials are concerned, and some say that we need to crack down hard on this kind of talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17715;The Common Man;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17715;Socialist leanings have become quite prevalent in parts of $COUNTRY$, and among these socialists radical ideas have been spreading -- namely that the common man can only achieve true freedom by overthrowing the government and establishing a rule by the working class. They cite the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as tyrannical, and one that will never bend to true reform... and the people have been listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17720;Communist Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17720;The tense situation in one of our states has been aggravated by the presence of communist agitators, spurring on the working classes to rise up against the government and institute a rule by the workers. We could step in, but that might only provoke a rebellion. Allowing the agitators to continue spreading their propaganda, however, might let them get a stronger foothold in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17730;Communists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17730;A communist demonstration in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, with shouts decrying the state of workers in $COUNTRY$, has gained the communists a great deal of attention and sympathy throughout $STATENAME$.

EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC19366;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, appealing for help in restoring their lost lands.

Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again?

EVTNAME19301;The Dream Is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19301;There was once a dream in this country - a dream of a land of liberty, of new opportunities. People would flock to the United States of America seeking freedom, opportunities and shelter from the horrors of war and intolerance of the old world. The Statue of Liberty, the USA proudest symbol, used to symbolize that, and that was the first thing immigrants saw when entering our country. The Statue is still there, standing ominously in the bay of New York, but it doesn't represent that dream anymore, nor any of the values it used to. With the recrudescence of the institutions in our country, the change from a democratic government, the Statue lost all meaning and people from all over the world stopped being enchanted by what it represented. \n \n The dream is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37236;The Construction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37236;Work on the foundations of the Eiffel Tower began. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block built of limestone each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. Each shoe was anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were complete by $YEAR$ and the erection of the ironwork began. For this part, we need to set a budget for the construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37237;The Eiffel Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37237;The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustré completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large French flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC3697000;During the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the fire of 1834, the parliament determined that the new buildings should incorporate an impressive clock tower and passed a bill to that end in $YEAR$.

The only thing left for the building to start is to define the budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME3697001;The Clock Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC3697001;The completion of the Clock Tower marks the end of the reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster. The clock tower was constructed on the northern extremity of the new Houses of Parliament that were built next to Westminster Hall. The commission for the clock itself demanded a high level of accuracy, the specifications drafted by the Royal Astronomer required that "the first stroke of the hour bell should register the time, correct to within one second per day, and furthermore that it should telegraph its performance twice a day to Greenwich Observatory, where a record would be kept." The second and final version of the hour bell was the largest ever cast in the UK. It was so colossal that a team of 16 horses was needed to pull the wagon upon which it rested from the foundry to the Tower. The transportation took on the character of a parade, with enthusiastic crowds lining the streets as the caravan made its way through London. The bell and tower got nicknamed "Big Ben".;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC880200;As more and more evidence against the ruling party has come to light, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it has no choice but to resign and call an election.

EVTDESC999042;'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweet and toil has brought the nation forward! We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n \n The subject of voting rights for the poor has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTB999044;There is no need to change the system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999045;Election Fraud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD!

EVTNAME999049;National Debate: Unemployment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999055;The Child Labor Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999056;The Rights of Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999057;The Immigration Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999060;War Dominates the Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999061;Talk of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbors, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999065;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME31510;A Greater Austrian Destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31510;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say Austria's unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. Still others say that, no, Austria already has its own name and empire, one that stretches over many cultures who would never welcome becoming more dominated by the Germans... not to mention that a Greater Germany would alarm the powers of Europe to such a degree it would almost surely herald a war. Thus the question arises: what shall our path be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers -- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams. Whole portions of the Empire have either declared their outright independence or their intention to reunite with their homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31530;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north.

EVTDESC31531;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. While such a nation would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would likely object to such a union. Is Greater Germany worth the possibility of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT31510OPTA;We will give up nothing to form Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT31510OPTB;Give limited autonomy to our non-German states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME800098;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Citizens Attacked in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800098;Several of our country's citizens have been attacked in the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$, an incident spurred on by the severe differences between our country's ideology and theirs. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has been extremely reluctant to admit any involvement in the affair, and our relations have been hurt as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2560;The Buffer State;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2560;This so-called 'buffer state' will not stop us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT2560OPTA;Enough is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2600;$STATENAME$ Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2600;$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole. There are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags waving in $PROVINCENAME$, flown by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, so it does not seem so far-fetched an idea that $STATENAME$ be eventually considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory by the world at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2605;$PROVINCENAME$ Integrated into $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2605;$COUNTRY$ has controlled $PROVINCENAME$ for a long time -- long enough for those within $PROVINCENAME$ to truly consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and for the rest of the world to consider the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to the province to be legitimate as well. Though there are still some unhappy with the development, $PROVINCENAME$ is now considered an integral part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2610;$STATENAME$ Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2610;$STATENAME$ is considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory -- that is only in dispute by those neighbors who still have recognized claims on the area, and who maintain that many within $STATENAME$ consider themselves citizens of their country and not ours. The first step in rendering their claim invalid would be to enact a policy that encourages the assimilation of all people within $STATENAME$... they should be $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and hold no other nationality above ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2611;Assimilation Policies Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2611;With the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military who warn that this is a dangerous idea, and that allowing these foreign identities to perpetuate will only lead to further conflict with our neighbors -- but, for now, their voices have been ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2615;Flags Burned in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them -- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$. Authorities broke up the demonstration, but there continues to be a growing discontent in the area. The turmoil has even spread to other citizens, who have begun calling on the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to end its assimilation policies and let the minority groups be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2616;Incident in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbors with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least -- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2620;Flags Flying in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2620;A parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high -- and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2625;$PROVINCENAME$ Assimilated!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2625;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is the only one that can now be found flying in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. At long last, it can be considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and only $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. Even those who are members of other cultures no longer consider themselves truly part of our neighbors -- much as those neighbors might be unhappy with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2626;Claims in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2626;$FROMCOUNTRY$ continues to hold some of our lands, lands which until today have always been considered part of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national territory. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ program of assimilation has succeeded, however, in weaning our own people away from any feeling as if this true. They no longer consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$, and indeed the international community appears to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2650;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to them -- and only the ones that belong to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2651;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2651;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to another nation -- but only those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2660;Our Lands Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2660;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$. \n \n §RNOTE: If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back.

EVTNAME98300;War-Time Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems -- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98303;Contentious Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC80121;Have Peace with Han Chinese! \n Down with Qing court! \n \n A rebellion has erupted in the southern province of Yunnan, led by a rebel named Du Wenxiu. Foreign ambassadors are calling this event the "Panthay Rebellion", a revolt from the Muslims in Yunnan.

EVTDESC90904;Perhaps $FROMCOUNTRY$ has grown beyond our ability to control them? They have been far more welcoming of western ways, to the point that now they consider themselves 'civilized' and on par with the barbarians outside of $COUNTRY$... Indeed, they even consider themselves above us, and have thrown off $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule as if it were a bad shadow. They seek to chart an independent course, but should we let them? Should we allow them to pretend they are not part of China, and reject the heritage of thousand thousand years?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160001;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160001;We are receiving disturbing reports of anarchy in southern China. A peasant army led by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui has declared the ascendancy of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' and driven out local governors. All within the Qing government agree that we cannot recognize these rebels as having credence -- if we do, it raises the question of whether the Mandate of Heaven is still held by the Imperial throne. That cannot be allowed, and thus the governors must be given the opportunity to crush the rebels and restore order in the Emperor's name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1600010;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared -- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarrassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160002;Taiping Rebellion Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the 'Heavenly Kingdom', and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160003;Truce With the Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160004;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory.

All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarrassment to the Qing government and our Emperor.

Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power.

Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qing dynasty.

They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society -- known to foreigners as 'Boxers' -- has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1645091;The Mandate of Heaven was a Chinese political and religious doctrine used to justify the rule of the emperor of China. According to this belief, heaven (tian)which embodies the natural order and will of the universebestows the mandate on a just ruler, the Son of Heaven.\n\nIf a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy, and had lost the mandate. It was also a common belief that natural disasters such as famine and flood were signs of heaven's displeasure with the ruler, so there would often be revolts following major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of this, we want, no, we NEED a free society, where no one is considered to be superior, no one is left behind and where mankind is free from oppression and scarcity. We need a society without a government, without class divisions and where the workers control the means of production. \n The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.';;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Money should be privately and competitively provided in an open market and personal and economic activities should be regulated by the natural laws of the market and through private law rather than through politics.'\n\n A group of liberals disgruntled with their lack of economic freedom, and the pace of parliamentary reform, have formed a new faction in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politics. The Anarcho-Liberals are the revolutionary avantgarde of the liberal ideology, and they will not hesitate to use whatever means necessary to see their ideas of freedom and free trade instituted both in $COUNTRY$ and abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME32537;The Rise of Mysticism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32537;Imperial Russia is confronted with a religious renaissance, a widespread interest in spiritual-ethical literature and non-conformist moral-spiritual movements, an upsurge in pilgrimage and other devotions to sacred spaces and objects. The "God-Seeking" are shaping their own ritual and spiritual lives, sometimes in the absence of clergy. The upper class of $CAPITAL$ had=s been widely influenced by this wave of mysticism. Individual aristocrats are reportedly obsessed with anything occult and this new fever for anything mystic has been spreading to the middle class and the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME32538;The Tzar's Son Falls Ill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32538;In $YEAR$, Tsesarevich Alexei, the Tzar's son, received an injury which caused him painful bleeding. When the doctors could not supply a cure, the desperate Tzarina looked for other help. Grigori Rasputin, a peasant who identified as a strannik, a religious wanderer, had already treated other nobles families and came for the desperate Tzarina. Rasputin was said to possess the ability to heal through prayer and was able to calm the parents and to give the boy some relief, in spite of the doctors' prediction that he would die. On the following day the boy showed significant signs of recovery. The careless Alexei received the last sacrament during another particularly grave crisis, and the desperate Tzarina turned to her lady-in-waiting, to secure the help of the peasant healer. The next day, Rasputin responded and sent a short telegram, including the prophecy: "The little one will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much." The boy's temperature dropped and the hematoma disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT32538OPTA;Well, I will be damned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32539;Intrigue in the Russian Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32539;While fascinated by Rasputin in the beginning, the ruling class of $CAPITAL$ became envious and turned against him: he had privileges no one else had. In $YEAR$, within four months, Rasputin had visited the Romanovs six times. The press started a campaign against Rasputin, claiming he paid too much attention to women. Hermogen, who told Rasputin to stay away from the palace, repeated the rumors that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a sect. Iliodor, hinting that Rasputin was Alexandra's paramour, showed Makarov a satchel of letters. The letters were handed to the Tzar and Rodzianko requested Rasputin to leave the capital. When Kokovtsov became prime minister he asked the Tzar permission to authorize Rasputin's exile to Tobolsk, but Nicholas refused: "I know Rasputin too well to believe all the tittle-tattle about him." Kokovtsov offered Rasputin 200,000 rubles for him to leave the capital, but he refused. Rasputin had become one of the most hated persons in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT32539OPTA;What nonsense is this? Rasputin proved to be a good man time and again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT32539OPTB;Something must be done about him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32540;Rasputin's Exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32540;After much time spent debating it, the Tzar was finally convinced to exile Rasputin. Tzarina Alexandra is inconsolable, blaming the Tzar if anything happens to their son. The Russian nobility and clergy rejoices, arguing that the Tzar made the right choice. Rasputin only looked the Tzar in the eyes, and said "Before we repent, we have to sin.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT32540OPTA;No one will miss him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32541;Russia Goes to War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32541;Despite attempts to convince the Tzar, Rasputin stayed in court. Iliodor, one of the main orthodox priests, had Khionia Guseva attack Rasputin. She stabbed Rasputin in the stomach, just above the navel. Covered with blood, Rasputin was brought into his house. The Tzar sent his own physician and after a laparotomy and more than six weeks in the hospital, Rasputin recovered. From the hospital Rasputin sent quite a few telegrams to the court, expressing his fears for the future of the country: "If Russia goes to war, it will be the end of the monarchy, of the Romanovs and of Russian institutions." In $YEAR$, Tzar Nicholas took supreme command of the Russian armies, leaving his wife in charge of ruling the country. Alexandra loathed the Duma because of its discussion of Rasputin. While seldom meeting with Alexandra personally, Rasputin had become her personal adviser through daily telephone calls or weekly meetings with Vyrubova. Rumors began on how the one really governing was Rasputin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME32543;Rasputin's Assassination;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32543;Two city policemen on duty near the Yusupov palace heard shots and screams. They discussed the issue on the Pochtamtsky Bridge. One of them rang at the door and questioned Yusupov's butler, but was sent away. Twenty minutes later he was re-invited to the palace. Purishkevich boasted he had shot Rasputin, and asked the policeman, aware of his mistake, to keep it quiet for the sake of the Tzar. Rasputin's beaver-fur coat and the body were discovered in a frozen river, 140 meters away from the Bolshoy Petrovsky bridge, with a shot in his frontal lobe. The two nobles who killed Rasputin were exiled by the Tzar, who came back from the front. Progressively, more and more people came to the conclusion that the problem was not Rasputin but the weak-willed Emperor, who had secluded himself in Tsarskoye Selo, unable to react on what happened. The struggle between the Tzar and the Duma became more bitter than ever, and the Tzar, more secluded in his palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT32543OPTA;A gruesome end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32544;The Communist Plot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32544;Everyone who met Rasputin remarked on his eyes and how hypnotic they were. His "shining steel-like" or "bright and brilliant" and "intelligent" eyes became legendary. According to Theofan, Paul Kurlov and Count Kokotsov he had "piercing" eyes. To Tamara Karsavina he had the eyes of a maniac. But his hypnotic eyes couldn't do anything against the bullet of one of the members of the Communist Party who believed he could destabilize the government by killing a close friend of the Tzar's family and the Tzarina most trusted advisor. The Russian nobility rejoiced at the death of Rasputin, assassinated as he left his home, but the death had the inverse effect that his assassin expected: the Russian Tzar left his isolation and ordered a hunt. The police organized a crackdown in every syndicate or communist party/organization, severely crippling communist support and organization, and rounding up a few suspects including a prominent figure in the communist circles, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32545;Attempt on Rapustin's Life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32545;During a visit to his home village, while exiting a church, Rasputin was attacked by a man. The man stabbed him in the belly three times before Rasputin managed to escape, running down the street with his hands on his belly. The man chased him, but Rasputin grabbed a stick from the ground and hit him on the head. Covered with blood, Rasputin was brought into the church. After ten hours a doctor arrived from the neighboring village and operated on him in the middle of the night. Rasputin stayed days under heavy guard and the man who attacked him was never found, but he recovered. He started drinking, his paranoia increased and eventually he asked to leave the service of the Tzar, which he did despite the Royal family protesting, and lived the rest of his life as an hermit. Nobles still went looking for him, asking for advice, and after he left his public image was somewhat redeemed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
