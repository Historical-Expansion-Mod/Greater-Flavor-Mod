end_of_natural_dyes_desc;The discovery of man-made synthetic dyes in the mid-19th century triggered a long decline in the large-scale market for natural dyes. Synthetic dyes, which can be produced in large quantities, quickly superseded natural dyes for the commercial textile production enabled by the industrial revolution, and unlike natural dyes, are suitable for the synthetic fibres that followed. In a few of our provinces, the production of natural dyes is in a steady decline for a few years and now producers can barely sell their product. Faced with bankruptcy, most dye producers are looking for new goods to sell. We can help them look for new markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;

The monkey skin apron hung from his waist, and in his right hand he flaunted his staff of command. To his right was Abba Moote, high priest of the Bubi, with his paddle in his hand, emblem of his dignity. To his left, his first lieutenant, Sas Ebuera. The elderly counselors and the king’s sixty wives crowded after him. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag Moka had received as a gift waved over the palace door.

The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century.

Lüderitz has plans to send expeditions further north, in the place the natives call Otjozondjii, known in German as Swakopmund but under the belief that a Great Power was about to claim the area as a protectorate, Lüderitz stalled his plans and asked for the protection of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government in $YEAR$.

We lack a treaty with the Colombians delineating our borders and, while they are the de facto owners of the Marabitana province, old Portuguese forts and presence of Brazilian laborers looking for rubber in the region entitles us to ownership of the area. The Marabitana fort itself was founded by the Portuguese, though it fell in disrepair. We can send the resident minister Enéas Martins on a special mission to Bogotá, to meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alfredo Vásquez Cobo, to delineate a treaty with the Colombians that might give us Marabitanas.

They divided the Empire into personal fiefs and fought each other continuously. A puppet Emperor of the dynasty was enthroned in Gonder by one warlord, only to be dethroned and replaced by another member of the Imperial dynasty when a different warlord was able to seize Gonder and the reins of power. Regions such as Gojjam and Shewa were ruled by their own branches of the Imperial dynasty and, in Shewa, the local prince went as far as assuming the title of King.

indonesia_raya_desc;'Indonesia Raya' - 'Great Indonesia' - is the national anthem of Indonesia since its proclamation of independence. The song marked the birth of the all-archipelago nationalist movement in Indonesia that supported the idea of one single 'Indonesia' rather than split into several colonies.

melayu_raya_desc;'Melayu Raya' is the name of the all-archipelago nationalist movement in South East Asia that supported the idea of one single country uniting the Malay people rather than split into several colonies. As such, it ambitioned the union of the East Indies, Dutch, British and Portuguese into a country strong enough to fight off western imperialism. The Pan-Malay union was based on understandings on similarities in race, shared language, religion and culture among ethnic groups.

Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was; they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight.

It's a philosophy aimed at uniting the very diverse peoples of the archipelago under a series of main banners, namely socialism, nationalism and religion, but also vague notions like justice, humanity, faith in representative democracy with no ethnic domination, welfare and monotheism.

closed_border_policy_desc;A closed border is a border that prevents movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no exceptions associated with this movement. These borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened they generally only allow movement of people in exceptional circumstances. In case of emigration as well as immigrations, departing ships are inspected for illegal emigrants.

immigration_quota_policy_title;Implement Immigration Quotas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This special set of conditions which limits the application of border controls that would normally otherwise apply could be defined by an international agreement or international law, or the special conditions could be defined by a regulation or law of the jurisdiction that the people are claiming the right to enter. Conditionally open borders generally requires a claim to be submitted from the people who are proposing to enter the new jurisdiction stating why they meet the special conditions which allow entry into the new jurisdiction. In the case of our country, quotas mean that no foreigners that fail a literacy test in their own language or are nationals of countries that were or are at war with our nation are allowed.

open_borders_policy_title;Abolish Immigration Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open_borders_policy_desc;An open border is a border that enables free movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no restrictions on movement. A border may be an open border due to intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border, or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border. One of the advantages of such a policy is that it requires little to none effort from the State's bureaucracy to keep control over immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This could be achieved most effectively with an exchange, and "the best guarantees for the security and development of the minorities remaining" after the exchange "would be those supplied both by the laws of the country and by the liberal policy of Turkey with regard to all communities whose members have not deviated from their duty as Turkish citizens". An exchange would also be useful as a response to violence in the Balkans: "there were", in any event, "over a million Turks without food or shelter in countries in which neither Europe nor America took nor was willing to take any interest".

turkish_tea_desc;Turkish tea, called çay, is an important part of Turkish culture. Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality though tea is most often consumed in households, shops and mostly kiraathane, which is social congregation of Turkish men. Turkish tea is typically prepared using two stacked kettles called "çaydanlik" specially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep (infuse) several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. Despite the growing popularity of tea in $COUNTRY$, there are no tea producing provinces in our homeland. Now the microclimate region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea was identified by specialists as an ideal spot to start tea production, which will contribute to the task of fulfilling the growing demand for tea by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. However, this knowledge is kept largely a secret by the British and they are bound to be dissatisfied if we start our own tea production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French laborer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavor only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery.

The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the center by Mandalay Hill. The 1020-acre citadel was to be surrounded by four 2,032 m long walls and a moat 64 m wide, 4.6 m deep. At intervals of 169 m along the wall, turrets were built with gold-tipped spires for watchmen. The walls had three gates on each side, and five bridges to cross the moat. In addition, the king also commissioned the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein upasampada hall, the Thudamma "Good Dharma" zayats or public houses for preaching Buddhism and a library for the Pali Canon.

the_1854_plan_desc;Born into a lower-middle-class family in Lille, Louis Faidherbe is a sub-director of engineers in the colonies of Senegal. He plays a central role in the implementation of "The Plan of $YEAR$": a series of ministerial orders given to Governor Protet of Senegal that originated in petitions from the powerful Bourdeaux-based Maurel and Prom company, the largest shipping interest in Saint-Louis. The plan specified in detail the creation of forts along the Sénégal River to end African control of the acacia gum trade from the interior. Faidherbe's push to build fortifications farther out generated conflicts with Protet, and his protests to Paris over Protet's inaction quickly awarded him some sympathy in the government. If we were to appoint him to chef de bataillon and then governor of the colony, we could quickly put the plan in action and take control of the coastal Wolof kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

russification_of_finland_desc;Having enjoyed prosperity and control over their own affairs, and having remained loyal subjects for nearly a century, the manifesto which the $MONARCHTITLE$ issued on $YEAR$ was cause for Finnish despair. The manifesto was forced through the Finnish senate by the deciding vote of the senate president, an appointee of the $MONARCHTITLE$ — and after the governor-general of Finland, Nikolay Bobrikov, had threatened a military invasion and siege. While ostensibly affirming the Finns' rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to "come within the scope of the general legislation of the empire". The main policies enacted were:\nThe conscription law, incorporating the Finnish army into the imperial army.\nThe Language Manifesto of $YEAR$ which made Russian the language of administration of Finland.\nThe Orthodox Russian Church was the church of state, including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of the Orthodox church to a Lutheran church service.\nThe Manifesto of $YEAR$ which asserted the imperial government's right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, including press censorship and restrictions of Russian currency and stamps as the only ones allowed.\nOur Finnish subjects will surely not like this and they might try to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tasmania_penal_colony_title;Van Diemen's Land Penal Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasmania_penal_colony_desc;In 1803 the island south of Australia was colonized by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen's Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labor to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works. Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur. Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women's workhouse prison). There were five female factories in Van Diemen's Land. Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen's Land. Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.\n\nWe can abolish the penal colony and convert the island to a regular colony.

1850_compromise_desc;Senators Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas have presented a draft proposal for a compromise on the slavery issue centered around the premise of popular sovereignty as the determinant for slavery or abolitionism in the territories. By supporting the draft proposal, we could calm tensions over the slavery issue for at least some time. The compromise is a package of five separate bills which will defuse a four-year political confrontation between slave and free states regarding the status of territories acquired during the Mexican-American War. The mains points are:\n1. Texas surrenders its claim to New Mexico, over which it had threatened war, as well as its claims north of the Missouri Compromise Line. It retains the Texas Panhandle and the federal government will took over the state's public debt.\n2. California is admitted as a free state with its current boundaries.\n3.The Wilmot Proviso will be fully rejected.\n4.The slave trade (but not slavery altogether) will be banned in Washington D.C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conquer_conakry_title;The Conakry Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conquer_conakry_desc;Since the 18th century, Portuguese, British and French traders had established small stations on the coast which was called Rivières du Sud by the French. The Portuguese had trading stations at Rio Pongo and Rio Nunez, mostly for the purchase of enslaved Africans captured inland and brought to the coast. By 1820, British suppression of the slave trade and Portuguese imperial decline saw these posts abandoned, with British and French traders moving in. The French admiral Bouët-Willaumez made a number of treaties with coastal communities in the area (usually under the threat of force), and ensured Marseilles based trade houses exclusive access to the palm oil trade by the 1840s. Used for making soap, the palm oil trade was with Diola merchants who established markets in the interior, and transported it to the coastal stations. We can formalize the colonial structure of these trade posts and routes to effectively take control of Conakry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

shinbutsu_bunri_title;Adopt the Shinbutsu Bunri;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shinbutsu_bunri_desc;The Japanese term shinbutsu bunri indicates the separation of Shinto from Buddhism, introduced after the Meiji Restoration, and therefore the separation of kami (native Shinto deities) from Buddhas (Buddhist deities), and of Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines (jinja). Until the end of the Edo period Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called shinbutsu-shugo, to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. The new government saw shinbutsu bunri as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism. A first order issued by the Jingijimuka on $YEAR$ ordered the defrocking of shaso and betto (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the Daijokan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as gongen to Japanese kami and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. Next came a ban on applying the Buddhist term Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic kami Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu and Usa Hachiman-gu shrines.In the final stage, all the defrocked betto and shaso were told to become "shrine priests" (kannushi) and return to their shrines.

imperial_rescript_desc;Following the Meiji Restoration, the leadership of the Meiji government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centered on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality; however, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for an "emperor-centered" philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others. After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Emperor Meiji.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

selangor_protectorate_desc;In the 19th century the importance of Selangor greatly increased by the rapid expansion of tin mining as a result of the increased demand for tin from the West. The desire to control the Klang Valley led directly to the Selangor Civil War (also called the Klang War) when Raja Mahdi fought to regain what he considered his birthright as territorial chief against Raja Abdullah. In $YEAR$ however, a ship from Penang was attacked by pirates near Kuala Langat, Selangor.

With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire became two independent states, Johor and Pahang. Later, Pahang was fought over in a civil war between the two sons of the reigning Bendahara of Pahang.

anglo_persian_oil_company_desc;The English Anglo-Persian Oil Company was the first company to extract petroleum from Iran. In 1901 William Knox D'Arcy negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din: he would assume exclusive rights to prospect for 60 years in a vast tract of territory and in exchange the Shah received 20,000 pounds, an equal amount in shares, and a promise of future profits. In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000 pounds into their Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home." The geologist Geroge Bernard Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after on May 26, 1908.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Mexicans also claim we owe them indemnity over the attacks and argue we agreed to pay under the conditions of our last treaty. These continuing tensions between Mexico and us complicated our efforts to find a southern route for a transcontinental railroad as the only viable routes passed through Mexican territory. Attempting to defuse the situation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ sent James Gadsden, the new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Minister to Mexico, to negotiate with Santa Anna.

The government invited farmers, soldiers and other immigrants from across the nation to promote the development of the wild land. The Kaitakushi also invited Horace Capron, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, to adopt overseas technology. The introduction of American technology helped advance both development and modernization, leading to the development of capital-intensive farming, the opening of coal mines and the construction of lumber mills, breweries and canneries that made use of local resources. With the construction and improvement of roads, ports and railways and the opening of the Seikan sea route between Honshu island (Aomori) and Hokkaido (Hakodate), urban areas will be formed throughout Hokkaido.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

abolish_los_fueros_desc;The relentless centralizing drive of the Spanish Crown led, after the end of the First Carlist War, to the reduction of the Basque institutional and legal system (called Fueros), but it was only after the last Carlist War that it was virtually wiped out. After the war, a new Spanish constitution was drawn up in order to establish a unitarian and central administration in Spain cut out according to a Spanish-Castilian pattern. Navarre was affected, but for the moment it was spared from further curtailments due to their 1841 "Compromise Act" (Ley Paccionada) that turned officially the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Navarre into another province of Spain. The Basques were forced to enroll in the Spanish military on an individual basis, and not in separate groups or corps, despite the fact that many Basques could hardly articulate a pair of phrases in Spanish, exposing them at best to stressful experiences. These changes allowed Spain to turn in a modern unified country, shaking off the last bits of the Ancien Régime, the first step to end the regionalism driving the forces behind the Carlists and Christinos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

enslave_the_serfs_title;Enslave the Serfs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enslave_the_serfs_desc;Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. A lord of the manor could not sell his serfs. On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord, benefiting him with their long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them. But through their condition of near slavery, we can revoke more rights of the serfs and force them in total slavery, untying them from the land and tying them to the lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

form_pakistan_title;Form Pakistan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered  the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was "a complete social order which affects all the activities in life" and "where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded". To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

integrate_uriankhai_title;The Annexation of Tannu Tuva;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_uriankhai_desc;Lately, the Tannu Tuva economy has seriously deteriorated, resulting in the increasing poverty of its people. The causes were varied: declining number of fur-bearing animals probably due to over-hunting by both Uriankhais and Russians, declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia, and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which took a fearful toll on livestock herds. The end of Qing rule in Tannu Tuva brought chaos, bands of Uriankhai began plundering and burning Chinese shops. Uriankhai nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Uriankhai governor (amban-noyon), Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Uriankhai.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonize_uriankhai_title;Claim Uriankhai;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonize_uriankhai_desc;After the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border by the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), the Qing inexplicably placed border guards south of the Tannu-ola Mountains separating Tannu Uriankhai from Outer Mongolia, not along the Sayan Mountains separating the region from Russia. During the 19th century, Russians began to settle in Tuva. The Qing Dynasty allowed Russians to settle providing that they lived in boats or tents. This historical basis and the Russian population living there provides us with an excuse to add the territory of Tannu Tuva to the Russian borders, and the founding of a new Russian city will only strengthen our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are calls for jihad by Muslim leaders like Maulana Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi and the millenarian Ahmedullah Shah, which were taken up by Muslims, particularly artisans, which caused the British to think that the Muslims were the main force behind this unrest. The Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, resisted these calls for jihad because, it has been suggested, he feared outbreaks of communal violence. By abiding to these calls, expelling the British from Delhi and declaring a Jihad, by shaking off the British influence and dominance, the Shah can be acclaimed Emperor of India, his rightful title.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By establishing our dominance over these provinces, we can expel the Russian rulers and annex them back to the Ottoman Empire, centralizing rule and restoring order to these territories that belong in our empire.

With our involvement in the Great War, our enemies are discussing the possibility of partitioning our territory.

The marshes undergo substantial changes in size during the year, with melting snows in springtime and autumn rainfall causing extensive flooding as the river overflows. As in most wetlands in Europe, the Pinsk Marshes are seen as an unhealthy area, a focus of maladies.

The Viceroyalty later expanded to encompass the territories acquired by Russia in a series of wars with the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and the local Caucasian peoples.

russify_baltic_states_desc;The Russian press took up the topic of German influence in the Baltic provinces. As early as the 1860s, the Slavophiles demanded the end of the autonomy in the Baltic provinces and a standardized administration. The unification of Germany and its subsequent development into a Great Power considerably increased the military-strategic importance of the Estonian and Latvian territories which bordered the Baltic Sea, between the extensively autonomous Finland and the rebellious Poland-Lithuania. The security of the capital St Petersburg became a serious issue for the Russian Empire.

Sa'adah rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation, and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He pointed to what he considered to be the region's distinct natural boundaries, and described it as extending from the Taurus range in the northwest and the Zagros Mountains in the northeast, to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea -including the Sinai Peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, and from the eastern Mediterranean Sea including the island of Cyprus in the west, to the arch of the Arabian Desert and the Persian Gulf in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we are to remain in our homelands and fend off the Russian ambitions, we need to unite once again against our common enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_the_boer_title;Make Amends with the Boer;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Boer farmers, paying compensation, abolishing Company rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Boers accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_aceh_question_title;The Aceh Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_aceh_question_desc;For much of the 19th century, Aceh's independence had been guaranteed by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 and its status as a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire since the 16th century. During the 1820s, the Sultanate of Aceh became a regional political and commercial power, supplying half of the world's pepper, which increased the revenues and influence of local feudal rajahs. Following the opening of the Suez Canal, the trade routes shifted and we are now in a position to strike a deal with the civilized protectors of the Aceh: allow us a free hand within their sphere of influence in Maritime Southeast Asia while we also take the responsibility to fight piracy in the region. With this deal we might get their sanction to conquer Aceh, though we should be ready to give something in return, most probably a colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_short_declaration_title;The Short Declaration;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_short_declaration_desc;The Short Declaration was short and brief because it contrasted with the "long" contracts that were earlier concluded between the Netherlands Indies government and some seventeen so-called self-governing lands. The latter were left under the charge of rulers who were empowered to deal with legislative and administrative matters pertaining to their territories, but they had to ensure that obligations to the Netherlands Indies government were met. The long contracts defined the limits of the competency of both rulers and the Netherlands Indies government. By issuing the Short Declaration, we will declare these contracts null and void and we will bring the Moluccan Islands and the Siak Sultanate under our direct control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

expel_manchu_from_primorye_desc;The Pacific coast near Haishenwai was settled mainly by the Chinese and Manchus during the Qing Dynasty period. The Manchus banned Han Chinese from most of Manchuria including the Haishenwai area — it was only visited by illegal gatherers of sea cucumbers. Our claims on the area grew strong and we took the area, founded new settlements and renamed it. But the Manchus are still a majority in most of Outer Manchuria and we can't force them to assimilate. Our advisers recommend that we should try to throw them out so we can strengthen our claim in the area. Should we succeed in expelling them, we can greatly increase the region attractiveness to immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

die_wacht_am_rhein_desc;In 1840, France's then prime minister Adolphe Thiers had claimed that the river Rhine constituted the natural eastern border of the French nation, sparking what would later become known as the Rhine Crisis, as this was perceived in Germany as a threat to Prussian possessions on the western bank of the river. In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the 'Fatherland to remain calm', for, as the poem says, 'fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine', implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all aggression. The poem was put to music in 1854, and became extremely popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

peking_convention_TPG_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other Codifications were also studied and taken into consideration, especially the Allgemeines Landrecht (Prussia), the ABGB (Austria) and the Sardinian Civil Code. But he was able to create a very peculiar style: the systematization is different from the French Code. The Portuguese Civil Code was unique for European civil codes, in its characterization of laws in terms of the person and property. It was divided into four sections: the person, the acquisition of goods, goods, and the defense of those goods or rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

education_decree_1863_desc;Through the Education Decree of 1863, Queen Isabella II decreed the establishment of a free public school system in the Philippines that used Spanish as the language of instruction, leading to an increasing number of educated Filipinos. This would be the first in a number of colonial initiatives that rendered the Philippines as one of the few places in the world where it was said to have visibly improved and prospered under colonial rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
treaty_of_paris_1898_title;Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
treaty_of_paris_1898_desc;Spain has no choice but to admit it cannot hold onto its Caribbean and Pacific holdings. If we sit down and enter into peace negotiations with the Spanish government, it is possible they might be willing to end this war and turn over their holdings to us… for a price. Some will see this as the beginnings of American colonialism, but to our government this is simply a recognition of the world power that the United States has become.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

treaty_of_paris_1898_victory_desc;We have been victorious in our war against Spain, and Cuba is now free. The Spanish government should realize it does not have the power to hold onto its North American and Pacific colonies. We should approach them and demand they turn over these colonies to us-- for, while it might indicate to some the beginnings of American colonialism, we feel these colonies are best entrusted to the care of a democratic Western power who has the power to hold them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

claim_schleswig_title;Claim Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_schleswig_desc;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into Denmark proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mediate_belgian_independence_desc;While Belgium's de facto independence from The Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure by The Netherlands and technically a state of war still exists between the two nations. The idea has arisen that the British Empire should step in and mediate a settlement, demanding the Dutch give up their claims in return for guarantees of Belgian independence and control over Luxembourg. With the powers of Europe at the table, it seems unlikely the Dutch would refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hatt_i_humayun_desc;The Hatt-i Hümayun, or 'Imperial Reform Edict', will take the concept of Ottomanism-- the belief that equality among the Empire's religious groups will solve its social issues-- to the logical conclusion. Full rights will be granted to the Empire's minorities, and laws passed to grant each millet the right to use  the religious law of its population. This will go a long way towards dealing with some of the nationalist strife the country has suffered, and bring the Ottoman Empire into a new and multicultural age.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, European-style, state. Resistance to these reforms will slow down technological progress for a time, but the benefit to Egypt itself will be immeasurable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan's. Other social reforms were addressed as well: discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry.

putiatin_mission_title;The Putiatin Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
putiatin_mission_desc;The Japanese islands have only recently begun to communicate with the larger world.

iwakura_mission_title;Iwakura Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iwakura_mission_desc;The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy was a Japanese diplomatic journey around the world, initiated in $YEAR$ by the oligarchs of the Meiji period. Although it was not the only such "mission", it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck and was probably based on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To renegotiate the unequal treaties with the Great Powers that Japan had been forced into during the previous decades and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to effect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meiji_constitution_title;Meiji Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meiji_constitution_desc;After an exhaustive study of western democratic methods, Japanese scholars have settled on a method of government where the Emperor will preside over an Imperial Diet, elected by the people and yet preserving both Imperial power as well as our traditions. This, they believe, is the best way for Japan to move forward into the modern era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
begin_line_of_advantage_title;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
begin_line_of_advantage_desc;The concept of riekisen, or the 'line of advantage', means that we must extend Japanese influence beyond our national borders in order to ensure our security. This means turning all of the Japanese military, and indeed our people, to the notion of foreign conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
refuse_line_of_advantage_title;The Path of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
refuse_line_of_advantage_desc;Instead of focusing on military might and conquest, Japanese security must be provided by devotion to technological progress and reform. We must match the Western powers, and quickly, or they will surely take advantage and find Japan sorely unprepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annex_korea_title;Annex Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annex_korea_desc;Preserving the independence of Korea is too costly. If the 'line of advantage' is to be maintained, we must push our borders well beyond their current sphere. Korea must be turned into a protectorate of the Empire, for its own good as well as ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_korea_title;Claim Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_korea_desc;With Korea under foreign rule, our nation feels threatened. The 'line of advantage' means that protecting our borders means extending our influence beyond them, and thus we must move to claim the Korean peninsula and wrest it from those who hold it in their grasp -- in the name of Korean freedom, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

order_to_expel_barbarians_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the role of the Emperor has been confined to that of figurehead. We lead Japan, yet we do not. Recently, the leadership of the Shogun has come into question. His increasing inability to deal with foreigners in a way that shows any manner of leadership compels the Emperor to act -- with or without the Shogun's permission. We shall send out a call to the people in our own name, demanding they rise up and throw out the foreigners that the Shogun will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
peace_with_the_emperor_title;Peace With the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
peace_with_the_emperor_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the Emperor has remained a figurehead. Even so, he is a leader of the Japanese people and, at times, has expressed dissatisfaction with our own position as ruler of Japan. This has caused conflict, and should we reach a point where our positions are not so different -- and, indeed, the Emperor is satisfied with our ability to rule, perhaps we can bring this conflict to an end once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

commodore_perry_expedition_desc;The Far East remains an enigma, and one which is beyond the reach of most western powers due to the enforced seclusion of China and Japan. While China is largely spoken for, Japan remains a potential target for American influence to expand. If we are to be taken seriously as a world power, we must consider sending a force to negotiate for trade rights with the Japanese-- under the threat of military force, if necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

overthrow_the_bakufu_desc;The time has come to restore Emperor Meiji to power. For too long has the imperial court been forced to remain but a figurehead, with central authority remaining with the tyrannical Tokugawa clan. Japan must have one ruler, an Emperor that can lead the nation into the future. Let us send our forces to Kyoto, to seize the imperial palace and set the coup in motion.\n\n§RNOTE: To win this war, you must occupy Edo or White Peace with the Shogun. You must not allow Kyoto and your capital to become occupied.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fukoku_kyohei_desc;Meaning 'Enrich the country, strengthen the military', this must become the objective of a unified Japan if we are to catch up with the technological advantage held by the West. We must face these barbarians at their own game, and be better at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abolish_the_han_system_title;Abolish the Han System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abolish_the_han_system_desc;The han system, under which the daimyo rule as feudal lords with very little central authority remaining to the government, is an antiquated relic that must be eliminated. The domains shall be replaced with prefectures, and the daimyos given roles as governors and bureaucrats. There will be resistance, but all will come to understand that this is for the greater good of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
become_japan_title;Bunmei Kaika;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
become_japan_desc;With the embracing of Western ideas and authority slowly falling away from the shogunate, the government will naturally pass first to the imperial court-- and eventually, with the extension of voting privileges to the landowners, to the Japanese people themselves. This is a natural process, and one the Tokugawa must embrace for the good of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fsa_shermans_march_to_the_sea_desc;During the campaign he conducted in November and December of 1864, Major General William Tecumseh Sherman applied the doctrines of Total War in what can best be described as a campaign of terror directed at the civilian population of the North. By operating deep inside Free American territory, and by destroying much of the north's civilian infrastructure, Sherman is often said to have broken the North's will to fight. Apply his methods, and it might be the final nail in the FSA's coffin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

france_protector_of_eastern_christians_desc;Up until now, the Russians have maintained sovereign authority over Christians in the Holy Land -- authority that rightfully belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. It is time for that to change. Furthermore, the Holy Lands can be a way of reuniting France after the political divisions of 1848-49. The revolutionary Left can be reconciled if it was engaged in a patriotic fight for liberty against the 'gendarme of Europe,' and the Catholic Right had long been pressing for a crusade against Orthodoxy that to them threatened Christendom and French civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

self_strengthening_movement_desc;The Self-Strengtening Movement was a period of institutional reforms initiated in China during the late Qing dynasty following a series of military defeats and concessions to foreign powers. \n\n The majority of the ruling elite still subscribed to a conservative Confucian worldview, but following China's serious defeats in the First and Second Opium Wars, several officials now argued that in order to strengthen itself against the West, it was necessary to adopt Western military technology and armaments. This could be achieved by establishing shipyards and arsenals, and by hiring foreign advisers to train Chinese artisans to manufacture such wares in China. As such, the "self-strengtheners" were by and large uninterested in any social reform beyond the scope of economic and military modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
