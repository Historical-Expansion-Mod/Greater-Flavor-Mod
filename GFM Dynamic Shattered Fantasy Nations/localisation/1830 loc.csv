schomburgk_line_title;The Schomburgk Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgk_line_desc;Following the dissolution of Gran Colombia, its unsettled and remote eastern frontier in Essequibo has been left unorganized and unprotected. Following our acquisition of Guyana from the Dutch, we inherited a territorial dispute over Essequibo with Gran Colombia which disputed the former Spanish treaty. Thus we have legal justification to seize this patch of jungle without conflict. The Royal Geographical Society of London recommends we send Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk to explore the region and delineate a proper border with Venezuela, as his work on surveying the Virgin Island of Anegada was quite impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schomburgkexplained;Abusing flimsy claims of inheritance of responsibilites from treaties between Spain and the Dutch, Great Britain has occupied Essequibo. With our recently nascent country barely posessing an army of note, there is nothing we can do to resist the Brits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORDEATH;After resigning from the presidency, Bolívar made his way to Cartagena de Indias to board a ship and settle down abroad. However, he rested in the Customs House of Santa Marta as his health made travel difficult. As his condition worsened, he needed a transfer to a quieter place and moved to a farm located in San Pedro Alejandrino on the outskirts of the city, where he entered the full care of his trusted family doctor. Initially optimistic, both he and his doctor eventually recognized the severity of the condition, leading to Bolívar writing his will and instructing his entourage how to proceed in the event of his death. \nAfter the passage of morning marked by an increasing decline of vital signs, the silence of the house's main hall, occupied by the aides, military leadership of the Patriot Army and Bolívar's closest friends, was interrupted by the words of his doctor inviting them to the next room to witness the great liberator's last moments. Surrounded by his entourage, and after a long but calm agony, Simón Bolívar died at 1 PM, 3 minutes and 55 seconds on Friday, December 17, 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORSLASTWORDS;'Colombians: You have witnessed my efforts to raise freedom where tyranny once reigned. I have worked with selflessness, abandoning my fortune and even my tranquility. I separated from command when I was persuaded that you distrusted my detachment. My enemies abused your credulity and they trampled on what is most sacred to me, my reputation and my love of freedom. I have been a victim of my persecutors, who have led me to the doors of the tomb. I forgive them. As I disappear from your midst, my affection tells me that I must make a manifestato of my last wishes. I do not aspire to any other glory than the consolidation of Colombia. All of you must work for the inestimable good of the Union: The people obeying the government to be free from anarchy, the ministers of the sanctuary directing their prayers to heaven, and the military using their sword to preserve the peace. Colombians! My last wishes are for the happiness of the country. If my death contributes to the end of the parties and the consolidation of the Union, I shall go to the grave in peace.'   -Simón Bolívar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_title;The Apulo Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
apulo_convention_desc;Gran Colombia is doomed. Without Bolívar, no force is strong enough to hold it together. With Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama in open revolt, Perhaps it would be better to face the facts and abandon the dream rather than spill more blood. President Rafael Urdaneta cannot handle the situation and has called for a convention to put an end to Gran Colombia and create a new state with a new constitution to consolidate what remains of our once great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTADORRESIGNS;Since 1828, Simón Bolívar has attempted to keep Gran Colombia together by assuming dictatorial powers to deal with the emergencies at hand. He has finally seen that this course of action has kept the union together but divided it ever more severely. He has now arrived at the conclusion that it would be best for Gran Colombia if he, El Libertador, resigned and left the presidency to a less divisive person. This however creates ever more uncertainty. Gran Colombia has always had Bolívar at its helm, what will happen now that he has left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMASECEDES;Led by traitorous Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru, Panama has declared its independence following the example of Venezuela and Ecuador. However, many inhabitants of Panama wish to remain as part of Colombia. Several officers have already voiced their opposition to Alzuru. It wouldn't be far-fetched to expect this independence movement to be short-lived unlike those in Venezuela and Ecuador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ECUADORSECEDES;Informed of the secession of Venezuela and Bolívar's death, the assembly of the district of the South has declared independence, founding the state of Ecuador. The departments of Quito, Azuay and Guayaquil are now under the supreme rule of Juan Jose Flores, the head of government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENEZUELASECEDES;Meeting in the council of Valencia, the assembly of the northern district chose the town for being the residence of hero of the wars against Spain, General José Antonio Páez who has been agitating against the government of Gran Colombia for years. Additionally, the town was the site of the separatist movement La Cosiata that occurred between 1826 and 1829. While the assembly's rhetoric was anti-Bolivarian from the start, once it had been informed of Bolívar's death, it took a turn for a worse. The assembly ultimately ceremoniously announced its independence from Gran Colombia as the state of Venezuela under the leadership of General Páez himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAQUESTION;General Tomás Herrera has lead a counterrevolt against Juan Eligio Alzuru to put an end to Panamanian independence and repatriate to Colombia. While his revolt is seeing a lot of success, he needs the support of the people. The question lies in their loyalty to Colombia. Will they work towards continued self-sovereignty or reintegration to Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANAMAREJOINS;Executed by General Tomás Hererra, Alzuru's revolt is no more. Panama has returned to Colombian rule amid much jubilation. Many hope the same may occur in Venezuela or Ecuador, but those hopes are clearly in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It establishes the seperation of powers, the responsibilities of public officials, the duty to protect the catholic church and the unitary form of government with decentralized local assemblies. Furthermore, it divides congress into an upper and lower house and sets its legislative terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADMIRABLECONGRESS;Simón Bolívar's years as dictator of Gran Colombia have done the union no good. His unquestioned reign has even been compared by many to that of the kings of Spain. Recognizing what is best for the union, he has called for a new constitutional assembly to create a constitution for Gran Colombia in a last-ditch effort to prevent its dissolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCNOCOLLAPSE;After much trial and tribulation, Gran Colombia is united once more. El Libertador can rest easy knowing that the Bolivarian legacy shall continue. However, now that the crisis of secession is averted, we must ask ourselves what lies in our future. How will we govern ourselves to ensure that Gran Colombia will survive and not collapse once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MERTHYRRISING;Some days ago riots started in the town of Merthyr Tydfil, north of Cardiff, and today there are already reports of it expanding into all Wales, being an all-out rebellion. It's the first time a red flag is seen in a workers' revolt, being a symbol of the workers. They protest against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment, and among the shouts were cries of "Caws a bara" (cheese and bread), "Annibyniaeth" (independence) and "I lawr gyda'r Brenin" (down with the king), being a clear threat to the monarchy. Do we give them more rights or we protect the monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWYORKSECONDFIRE;On a night in 1835, a fire broke out in a five-story warehouse at 25 Merchant Street, at the intersection of Hanover Street. As it spread, gale-force winds blowing from the northwest towards the East River spread the fire. It could be seen from Philadelphia, approximately 80 miles away. At the time of the fire, major water sources were frozen in temperatures as low as -17°F, forcing the firefighters to drill holes to access liquid water, which later refroze around the houses and pipes. Efforts were made to deprive the fire of fuel by demolishing surrounding buildings, but there was insufficient gunpowder. Later in the next evening, a detachment of U.S. Marines returned with gunpowder and stopped the fire. During the day and a half that it burned, the fire killed 2 civilians and in total destroyed 660 buildings, resulting in property damage estimated between 20-25 million.

EVTDESC127854;3 days ago Nat Turner, an enslaved African-American preacher, had organizad a rebellion of enslaved and free Black people in Southampton County, Virginia. Turner was recorded as "Nat" by Benjamin Turner, the man who enslaved him and his family. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, under then-current laws which made slavery legal, Nat was inherited as property by Benjamin's son Samuel Turner. On February 12, 1831, he witnessed a solar eclipse that was visible from much of the southeastern United States, and was convinced that it was the sign for which he was waiting. He began preparations for an uprising against the enslavers in Southampton County by purchasing muskets. The last 3 days they have been waging terror in Southampton, but have been stopped today by local militias and detachments of men from the USS Natchez and USS Warren. Approximately 120 black people died today, and around 60 white people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC127855;Turner eluded capture for six weeks, but remained in Southampton County. On October 30, a White farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people, in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. While awaiting trial, Turner confessed his knowledge of the rebellion to attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray, who compiled what he claimed was Turner's confession. Today he got sentenced to death and hanged for "conspiring to rebel and making insurrection".;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16051840;In the rural town of Uster, Zürich canton, locals gathered today in a peaceful assembly to protest the overrepresentation of the cantonal capital compared to Zürich's rural parts. They argue that Uster's livelihood has been neglected, causing its locals to languish in poverty and remain largely uneducated. They also call for a new constitution to overhaul the governance of all Switzerland's cantons. For citizens to call for the constitution's repeal or amendment is unheard of: they are legally prohibited from petitioning the government to make such changes. Neverless, the liberal ideas left behind by Napoleon's rule clearly are still showing their influence. This will definitely not be the last call by our people for fair representation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051841;Never before have our people made such strong demands against our government while also not shedding a drop of blood. Today, discontent locals in the Freiamt region of Aargau canton led an uprising in protest of reduced rural representation in the constitution. They demonstrated their resolve by organizing themselves into militias. Despite clashes across Freiamt where about 6,000 total militia members confronted Swiss forces--with both sides prepared to engage--not a single shot was fired. Miraculously, the government agreed to a revision to the constitution and negotiated an end to the uprising. This marks an indelible end to the illiberal, undemocratic government before Napoleon's time, where the government could get away with unequal or unfair representation of the people. Aargau was ruled particularly heavy-handedly by governor Johannes Herzog, who has been claimed to want to run a duchy instead of a canton. Well, his tyranny ends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When they arrived, the beys were greeted by a military procession--but the next thing they knew, upon a hand signal from Mehmed, the Turkish soldiers opened fire on the beys and killed them all. \n\nThe Ottomans have removed the one element in the government we could count on to stop our full annexation. Lest we let our dream of an independent Albania die out, we must rally our people and declare a war for our liberation against the Ottomans--right now.

CONCEPCIONEARTHQUAKE;A devastating earthquake has hit Concepción and nearby Talcahuano today at 11:30 AM. The quake combined with a resulting tsunami have left Concepción destroyed, with most buildings in ruins. Miraculously, though, casualties have remained low, with only 50 people reported dead. The lack of deaths is attributable to how the quake was slow to intensify and happened at about high noon, allowing locals to get to safety in time. Charles Darwin happened to be in Concepción as the earthquake struck, on a stop for the second voyage of the HMS Beagle. He would describe the quake as such: "I happened to be on shore, and was lying down in the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly, and lasted two minutes, but the time appeared much longer. The rocking of the ground was very sensible . . . The people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm. It is these accompaniments that create that perfect horror of earthquakes, experienced by all who have thus seen, as well as felt, their effects.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The barrage killed 18 people but only minorly wounded Louis-Philippe, and Fieschi was immediately captured. \n\nIt has since then been discovered that four barrels of the volley gun did not fire due to the components' failure. Surely more would have died, including the King, had the weapon worked as intended. Fieschi is imprisoned and awaiting trial, while Pépin and Morey are still at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But now, we have gone a bridge too far for the Ottomans--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of the Emirate of Bohtan, which is a Turk vassal. This can only end badly. . .;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZAKHOISBOHTAN;The Emirate of Soran was established in 1399 and subjugated by us in 1554. It stayed our peacable vassal for several centuries until the ambitious Mir Mohammed proclaimed himself "Emir Mansur"--an independent ruler. He has since then expanded his army and begun waging war on neighboring principalities, hoping for Soran to become the dominant Kurdish tribe. But now, he has gone a bridge too far--figuratively and literally--crossing the ancient Delal Bridge to conquer Zaxho, a part of our vassal the Emirate of Bohtan. Something must be done to stop Soran's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

soran_je_ottoman_desc;While the Emirate of Soran has been driven back, the Emir still poses a threat to the region's stability. Letting his rule continue despite his rebellious actions may inspire other Kurdish chiefs to do the same. While the last expedition retook Soran's conquests but had to turn back shortly before the capital, Rewanduz, due to bad wheather, this second attack is sure to put an end to the dangerous Emir once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

fund_french_settlement_in_algeria_desc;Although our New World colonies are gone, our settler-colonial ventures are not yet over, still going strong in Algeria. But more often than not, these settlers will need a considerable amount of funding to ensure their livelihood in the new land. Thus, as the mother nation, it is seen as our duty to provide for their needs. The question is how much money we shall offer them, if at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGADEADAF;With our newfound victory over the Algerians, we must continue the fight against the tribesmen who are holding out, rallying in the hinterland against colonial rule. Hussein Bey, the former ruler of Algeria has fled to his strongholds in the East surrounding Constantine, as the populace has lost all confidence in his rule due to his defeat. In this power vacuum, a new figure has emerged: Abdelkader ibn Muhieddine, a minor sharif and islamic scholar has rallied the tribes to resist us in unison. We know, however that such backwards, unorganized rabble cannot stop us! Soon, all of Algeria shall be ours! Vive la France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCETROLLED;France has pathetically attempted to conquer our great nation, and they have failed, as they had failed in Egypt in 1800, Haiti in 1804, and Russia in 1812. It is time to choose to either move forward as an independent nation or reapproach the Ottoman Empire for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANDOURENA;It is time to decide our policy of on the new settlers in Algeria and what they shall recive from the French state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUZCUOGLUREVOLTS;A rebellion has risen within the Sanjak of Lazistan, resisting the installment of derebeys--local governors--who are cruel and care most about consolidating Ottoman control. This comes as a result of a blood feud between the Hazinedaroglu and Tuzcuoglu families, both of whom have vied for control of Lazistan as derebeys. Derebey Adjara Osman Hazinedaroglu has used his authority to levy large taxes on his subjects, which contributed to food scarcity in 1829 and 1830. Locals have now begun to stop paying taxes and rebel, with rival Derebey Tahir Aga Tuzcuoglu as their leader. We cannot allow Tuzcuoglu to continue his defiance. We must put an end to the rabble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUZCUOGLUCRUSHED;Lazistan has been pacified and plundered by our army. With the Tuzcuoglu family removed from power, we can tighten our grip on the province and ensure its governors will be unconditionally loyal to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

uruguay_const_1830_desc;Inspired by the liberal ideas of the American and French revolutionaries, calls for a constitution firmly establishing Uruguay as a representative democracy are echoing within the government. Under this constitution, Uruguay will be represented by a president and a two-chamber legislative branch consisting of the Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Senators. Meanwhile, supreme legal power will be put in the hands of the Supreme Court of Justice. The constitution will also strengthen the federal government's authority--so much so that our country will be considered a unitary republic. Nevertheless, the constitution's passing will be a firm, welcomed step in the direction toward equality and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_title;The Anglo-Ashanti Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_ashanti_treaty_desc;Border conflicts with the Ashanti Empire have been a constant occurrence since we first established our colony on the Gold Coast. With it obvious, though, that the Ashanti cannot fully repel our troops and retake that land, perhaps we should send them an ultimatum. We shall force an agreement that our borders will lie on the opposite banks of the Pra River, the natural boundary of the Gold Coast colony. Of course, there's nothing stopping us from eventually breaking this treaty and conquering them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051835;Border conflicts with the British are continuing with no end in sight, lest one of us falls entirely or agrees to peace terms. Britain has come to us with an ultimatum: that we recognize their sovereignty over the Gold Coast colony and share a natural border along the Pra River. This will put us at peace for the meantime and, unfortunately, leave our brethren on the coast at Britain's whim. But war is tiring, and we've certainly had our share of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051836;The Ashanti have accepted our peace offer. We can lay down our arms and rest assured that the next time we go to war with them, they will stand no chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16051837;Our peace offer to the Ashanti Empire is dead in the water. If we ever felt guilt over killing these poor tribespeople--well, think back to how they turned Colonel Governor McCarthy's skull into a gold-plated drinking cup. Now we can look forward to drinking wine aplenty from their skulls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romania_semiconst_1831_title;The Regulamentul Organic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
romania_semiconst_1831_desc;While the Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moladvia are Ottoman vassals, we have retained garrisons in them since the war of 1828-29. The populace is becoming increasingly resentful of this, especially as we have confiscated Wallachia and Moldavia's treasuries for the time being. It is up to us to shape their governments for the better and hand them back control over their finances. The proposed Organic Regulation would form the organic law, or legal system forming the basis of government, of the principalities. It would establish a national assembly in Iasi and Bucharest elected by no more than 3000 of the most influential citizens. Furthermore, the Organic Regulation would, among other things, ensure the independence of the judiciary and establish a poll tax in place of the old indirect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REGULAMENTULORGANIC;Russia has imposed a legal system forming the basis of government on us:  the so-called Regulamentul Organic, or "Organic Regulation." This semi-constitutional document returns to us the Russian-confiscated treasury, establishes a national assembly elected by the three thousand most influential citizens, ensures the independence of the judiciary and replaces the old indirect taxes with a poll tax among many other reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REFORMISTREVOLUTION;The government of José María Vargas has become opposed by a growing movement for the restoration of Gran Colombia. The rebels are led by heroes of the war of independence, including Santiago Mariño, Diego Ibarra and José Laurencio Silva, all formerly loyalists to the bolivarian cause. They have rallied their forces in the city of Maracaibo and begun marching East to take Caracas. Now, in turn, José Antonio Páez, the man who split Venezuela from Gran Colombia and spelled its doom has returned from retirement and assembled militia to join the struggle on the government's side. It seems that the old rivalry between proponents and detractors of Gran Colombia is to play out one final time--on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_title;The Peruvian Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peru_const_1834_desc;Now that the Bermudists have been defeated, we can finally set about finishing the new constitution. The proposed draft mostly reiterates the 1828 constitution and follows its liberal spirit but makes some adjustments to combat instability which has been experienced since. For example, the post of vice-president would be removed due to the bad contact of former VP Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente. Another example is the prohibition of immediate presidential reelection, a tactic used by Augustín Gamarra to elongate his presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCONGRESSPRU;The 1828 Constitution had agreed that in 1833, five years later, a new constitution would be formulated to adapt to the new situation of our country and possibly implement a federal system. Thus, a constitutional congress has gathered and heald a vote to elect a provisional president until the new constitution is finished. Pretenders for the position were the liberal Luis José de Obregoso, the conservative Pedro Pablo Bermúdez and the independent Domingo Nieto. Obregoso won with 47 votes to Bermúdez's 36 and Nieto's 1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONSTITUTIONALCIVILWAR;Pedro Pablo Bermúdez has rejected the result of the constitutional convention's election of José de Obregoso and risen up in revolt, beginning a civil war. While Bermúdez enjoys the support of most of the army, the populace of Lima and Arequipa are on the side of Obregoso, forcing Bermudist troops to retreat from the cities, unable to capture them with the adamant opposition of the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nevertheless, it is our duty to consolidate our brand-new nation, uniting the Flemish, the Walloons and the small German minority. We shall create a constitutional monarchy, a compromise between liberals and the conservatives. The state will have three branches of government and afford privileges to the Catholic Church. Basic freedoms such as that of expression, worship, and the press will be guaranteed. However, only landed subjects will be able to vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANANTHEM;La Brabançonne, the song that has become a rallying cry and source of Belgian nationalism, was not, in fact, been written by a Belgian. A French mercenary serving in Brussels, known by the alias Jenneval, composed the original poem the song is based on before dying in action. The title refers to inhabitants of the region of Brabant, where Brussels is located. The poem originally scolded rioters during the revolution and claimed the Dutch Prince of Orange would be the "example of kings" and "father of Belgians" if he granted Belgium independence. However, following the bombardment of Antwerp, he wrote a second version condemning the Dutch for their brutality. An arrangement with the second version's lyrics, set by François van Campenhout to the tune of "L'Air des lancers polonais" ("Song of the Polish Lancers"), has immediately gained popularity among our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKING;Although our constitution declares us a constitutional monarchy, as of yet we lack a monarch. Three options have been debated: Firstly, the Duke of Nemours, son of revolutionary king Louis-Philippe of France. Secondly, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a member of the British royal house. Thirdly, a minor noble. The French candidate, while ensuring French protection would surely be concerning to the UK and Prussia who would see it as an increase in revolutionary influence in Europe. On the other hand, the British candidate would probably have some strings attached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRANCE;Belgium has sent us an emissary to propose the coronation of the Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe as king of Belgium. While this would give us much influence over Belgium, it would surely attract the ire of the British and Prussians. Additionally, Belgium's industry, which is larger than ours, would, by increased interaction with our economy, hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRBEL;King Louis-Philippe has given the go-ahead to the coronation of the Duke of Nemours. Celebrations have begun amid his arrival in Brussels. Belgium finally has a king, and a popular one at that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSABONKFR;The Duke of Nemours, son of king Louis-Philippe of France, has been crowned king of Belgium at the bequest of the provisional government. This act spreads the influence of the French revolution further throughout Europe and endangers the old order. With the Louis-Philippe's son on the throne, Belgium is now a French protectorate in all but name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGFRNO;Louis-Philippe has refused to let his son become king of France. The reason he gives for this is twofold: On the one hand, he does not wish to raise the ire of the other European powers, specifically Prussia and the UK, by extending his influence. On the other hand, Belgium's industry far outmatches France's and economic intermingling between the two would hurt French artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIUMNEEDSAKINGBRIISH;Belgium has sent us an emissary proposing the coronation of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as their king. While it would definitely increase our influence on Belgium, we would get mixed up in their ongoing conflict with the Dutch. An agreement called the "Treaty of the Eighteen Articles" has been proposed which would agree to the coronation of Leopold under the condition that the matters of Limburg and Luxembourg are for Britain to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BELGIUMINDEPENDENCE;Rebel leaders have formed a provisional government to cooperate and organize the revolt into a formidable united force. Today, they have finally declared the independence of "Belgium," a Catholic state encompassing Luxembourg, Wallonia, Flanders and Limburg. All these lands are, aside from a few forts still held by our troops, in the hands of the rebels. They have already begun reaching out to other European powers in pursuit of recognition. After the disaster in the September Days, our army is in too much disarray to fight. Our only option is biding our time and invading once we have built up our strength and licked our wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEPTEMBERDAYS;A force of 12,000 soldiers under the leadership of Prince Frederick marched into Brussels, determined to restore order. Yet they were completely unprepared for the challenge they faced: seemingly every inhabitant is on the side of the rebellion. The soldiers were embattled from all sides and constantly under fire. The raw ferocity and determination of the populace brought the organized army to its knees, unable to hold in face of such opposition. After four days of fighting, they were routed and fled North in disarray. This humiliating defeat has solidified the rebels' position and cast doubt on whether we shall ever be able to retake the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRUSSELSRIOTS;Tensions have long been rising in our Catholic southern provinces due to grievances, including but not limited to the following: underrepresentation of Catholics in the General Assembly, the south having to pay for the larger debt of the north, Protestant domination of government ministries, and inadequate freedoms of press and assembly. With news of the successful recent revolution in France, the situation has escalated. A large group of opera-goers began rioting in the streets after attending The Mute Girl of Portici, a sentimental and patriotic opera set during an Italian 17th-century uprising against Spanish rule. Droves of inhabitants joined the mob, which proceeded to storm government offices. Now, a day later, the mayhem has only worsened, spreading across the south and driving our forces into retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEFLAHAUTPLANENG;France has proposed that we partition Belgium instead of recognizing it. We would receive Ghent and Antwerp, while France would get Wallonia and Brussels, Prussia would be given Luxemburg and Liège, and the Dutch would receive Limburg and Hasselt.

The king we have in mind is Purandar Singha, a prince of the Ahom Kingdom.

OHWELLDUTCHNVASION;The Dutch have crossed into Antwerp province, ready to engage our forces and crush our noble revolution. As of now, they are advancing into the forests around Ravels, and Zondereigen has been taken at the cost of 400 Belgian troops being repelled. These troops are clearly better trained and equipped than our own, and their leadership includes the Prince of Orange himself, eager to see his kingdom's reunification through by any means. We must not resign to possible defeat. Our future lies in our own hands, not the House of Orange's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OHWELLDUTCHNVASIONFRA;The separatist Kingdom of Belgium requests our support in fighting off the Dutch for independence.

spanish_inquisition_desc;§GLose 1 infamy§! The Tribune of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, commonly called the Spanish Inquisition, is the police force responsible for enforcing strict observance of Catholicism in the Spanish Empire. Established at the end of the Reconquista, it oversaw the mass conversion and expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain, and since then it has been responsible for enforcing the consolidation of the Spanish crown's rule by ensuring Catholicism unites its disparate subjects. But the Inquisition is not what it used to be. It was temporarily abolished under Joseph Bonaparte's reign and was reinstated by Ferdinand VII in 1814. Liberalism continues to weaken the Inquisition's strength to eradicate Christian heteroodoxy. The organization has been reduced to a censorship committee, rarely overseeing prosecutions anymore. Perhaps it is time to disband the Inquisition and bury its legacy in the sand dunes of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

july_ordinances_desc;§RCauses a Revolution§! Liberalism is a scourge upon the monarchy. It must be put down through a heavy-handed approach to ruling France's subjects, lest we fail to save the French people from their naive ideas of how they wish to be governed. Chief Minister Jules Armand de Polignac, an ultraroyalist who has long been targeted by the liberals, proposes a set of royal ordinances meant to reign France in: they include limitation of press freedom, a newly appointed set of reactionary Councillors of State, the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, and the exclusion of the middle class from future elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SEIZUREOFLENATIONAL;In response to the July Ordinances' restrictions on press freedom, staff writers at the liberal newspaper Le National published a petition demanding restoration of their rights. Agents of the prince de Polignac then promptly raided the journal's offices. Le National originated as a liberal mouthpiece in light of de Polignac's rise to power, patronized by liberal officials such as the prince of Talleyrand and the duke of Broglie. The paper's existence proves a thorn in the state's backside. We maintain that the government acted fully in its authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JULYREVOLUTION;The Bourbon monarchy is no longer in France as of today. After the surge of reactionary behavior under Chief Minister de Polignac--who was narrowly re-elected after having been voted out in a motion of no confidence--the French people were ignited to relaunch a revolution in the spirit of the first. De Polignac foolishly attempted to singlehandedly alter France's constitution by passing the draconian July Ordinances, attempting to create a newly authoritarian monarchy. Rioting and looting has dragged on for three days, until the people finally captured the Hôtel de Ville in Paris and declared a provisional government, after wholly defeating the last of the royalists' forces. A new monarchy is expected to emerge with Louis Philippe of Orléans, a former Republican general, as king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOUISPHILLIPETROLLS;France's new king has taken the throne: Louis Philippe of Orléans. As duke of Chartres and a former general of the Revolutionary Wars, he served with distinction but later broke with the revolutionaries after they decided to kill King Louis XVI. He later exiled himself to Switzerland in 1793 after it was discovered he was conspiring to restore the monarchy. \n\nCharles X had named Louis Philippe his lieutenant general, though he not-so-secretly held ambitions to succeed Charles as king.

[...] However, Sire, in the midst of the unanimous feelings of respect and affection with which your people surround you, there is manifested in people's minds a deep anxiety which disturbs the security which France had begun to enjoy, alters the sources of its prosperity, and could, if it were prolonged, become disastrous to his rest.'\nPresident of parliament Royer-Collard opened its new session with an address to Charles X approved by a 221 deputies, the liberal majority. This address demands that Chief Minister Polignac resign and that future ministers pledge to act in accordance with the wishes of Parliament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JUNEREBELLION;Fighting has broken out between the National Guard and republican rebels, who have conspired to overthrow the July Monarchy. After the funeral of former army commander and anti-monarchist Jean Maximilien Lamarque, riots emerged as citizens sympathetic to his beliefs attempted to make their opinions against the government heard. Attacks against our forces were swift and well-organized, carried out by secret societies such as the infamous Society of the Rights of Men, whose members stockpile weapons as if building an army. Their fighters were reinforced by disaffected Parisien youth and refugees from Germany, Poland, and Italy, each of whom were being pursued by their respective governments for participating in republican activism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The time has come to uphold our promise to the Italians and join them in battle against their Austrian oppressors. If we were to back down now, we would doom the revolution - and severely damage our international prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCEITALY1831;We have been approached by a number of Italian revolutionaries belonging to the Carbonari, a secret society that helped bring king Louis-Philippe to power in Paris in the July Revolution. The Carbonari's ultimate goal, however, is the unification of Italy. To their chagrin, Austria is bound to intervene militarily in any Italian uprising so as to preserve the status quo. Therefore, the Italian revolutionaries request that we guarantee that Austria does not get involved - to the point of sending our army to aid the Italians should the Austrians not heed our warning. Perhaps promising assistance would be enough to set off a revolution that would inconvenience our Austrian rivals, even if we duplicitously never intend to aid the Italians in the first place.

VENDEEETCHOUANNERIE;Legitimist sentiment is rising in the departement of the Vendée, within Brittany. Legitimists pledge allegiance to the House of Orléans as the rightful heir to the monarchy, and are willing to attack French forces to see the installment of an Orléans dynasty through. Charles X, who was exiled to Scotland following the July Revolution, has given up on reclaiming the throne. It has thus been concluded that his daughter-in-law, Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Siciles, must be orchestrating the unrest, for she has been promoting her young son Henri's claim to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIESTARTS;The struggle against the Legitimist rebels in the Vendée has escalated to open combat. Troops must now rally to engage the rabble! Legitimist generals like Louis de Bourmont and Charles de Beaumont d'Autichamp who left France when king Louis Philippe took the throne have returned to spearhead the revolt. But however good its generals may be, the rebellion is comprised of the very conservative rural populace of the region who have little to no experience in combat. Additionally, the rebels lack guns and ammunition which they had hoped to get in the form of foreign support of which there is none forthcoming. \n§RNOTE: Merge the armies that spawn after this event!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEBOR;The Legitimist revolution is a success. France now has a new king: Henri of Orléans, former Duke of Chambourd. Henri was not in the line of succession for the throne under the current Bourbon dynasty, though his mother, Marie-Caroline, Duchess of Berry, resented his exclusion. This is because Henri's birth to his two members of the Bourbon-Two Sicilies house created a perfect line of descendence from King Louis XVI, the first French Bourbon monarch. Thus, Marie-Caroline considers Henri the rightful king and herself regent. She collaborated with Legitimist militants to install her son--and the results now speak for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VENDEEETCHOUANNERIEFRA;The Duchess of Berry has been connected to the now-defeated Legitimist insurrection in the Vendée. Having resented her son Henri's not being in the line of succession on the French throne, she collaborated with militants to see Henri installed. Her resentment is driven by how Henri is directly descended from King Louis XVI, and also has a mother from his same royal house. Because of this, some legitimists see Henri as the rightful king, after the abdications of Charles X and Louis Antoine. \n\nThe Duchess was arrested today and will remain incarcerated for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These lands are the homes of indigenous tribes such as the Mapuche and Ranqueles, whom we experience friction with due to frequent border raids on our territories by them. The campaign has several front lines, spanning from the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes. By its end, we will have subjugated the Indians and expanded our domain to allow immigrants to settle in its heretofore untamed frontiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAAHUMANU;Following the death of Kamehameha II during his visit to England, Queen Ka'ahumanu became the regent of Hawaii. The favorite wife of Kamehameha I, the founder of the kingdom, she wields a great amount of influence in the kingdom as she reigns over the minority of her stepson Kamehameha III. \nA devout Christian ever since her conversion in 1824, she has been notable for stamping out pagan practices in the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;

Their decision was to move our border a bit further North to the so-called Arta-Volos line and to install a Catholic Bavarian prince by the name of Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern. Another demand of the three guarantors is the final abolition of slavery in Greece. While this agreement would hand a significant amount of currently Ottoman land to us, having a German Catholic on our throne is almost unacceptable. However, if we refuse to abide by the conference's terms, our former guarantors may abandon us in the event of an Ottoman attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONDONCONFERENCE1832;France, Russia and the UK have finished a conference in London to establish a permanent government in Greece and definitively delineate its borders. Their decision was to move the border a bit further North to the so-called Arta-Volos line and install a Catholic Bavarian prince by the name of Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern. This means that we would lose even more land to the Greeks than had previously already been agreed on in the convention of 1830. However, if we refuse to conform to the will of the three guarantors of Greek independence, they will surely support Greek expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ecuador_const_1830_desc;The separation of the Districto del Sur from Gran Colombia birthed the new state of Ecuador. As a former province of that once large yet eventually ungovernable country, we lack a national identity--and a constitution. President Juan José Flores has called a assembly to draft our future constitution to proclaim the State of Ecuador. With this said, our intention is to eventually rejoin a future confederated Colombia as one of its constitutent countries. Thus the constitution will contain no clause contradicting Colombia's constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our instability makes aspirations to rejoin Colombia impossible, and we must solidify our identity as a sovereign nation. Ecuador shall be independent forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAPOLEONTHESECONDDIES;The fated heir to Napóleon I's empire passed away today of tuberculosis. \n\nBorn in 1811, Napóleon II had been named Prince Imperial per the French Empire's constitution and was proclaimed King of Rome by his overly proud father. He reigned over France for two weeks after his father's second abdication in 1815, aged only three. The backdrop of the Allies' capture of Paris made an anticlimactic end to his ascension--though he ruled from Austria the entire time while living with his mother. Later he was granted the title of Duke of Reichstadt and was appointed as a cadet in the Austrian army. His military career fascinated and caused apprehension among European leaders, who feared he may usurp the French throne later as an adult. Alas, this never came to be. He died in Vienna's Schönbrunn Palace at 21.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMERICANANTISLAVERYSOCIETY;Slavery's continued existence in the United States continues to face challenges from outspoken critics. The American Anti-Slavery Society, formed by abolitionist journalist William Lloyd Garrison, has grown out of these outcries and vows to do all it can for the abolitionist cause. They are officially pacifist, but its members have signed a pact to show their willingness to become martyrs if necessary. \n\nThe abolitionists know slavery's status quo is slowly crumbling. With the Supreme Court already having proclaimed states cannot nullify federal laws, it is only a matter of time until an abolitionist Congress or president gains power and nationally outlaws slavery. The Anti-Slavery Society wishes in the meantime to appeal to Americans' morals to convince them of slavery's atrocity and sinfulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NEWZEALANDINDEPENDENCE;The Maori people of New Zealand have codified their nationhood in a documet titled "He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni"--the New Zealand Declaration of Independence. Thirty-four chiefs drafted and signed the document, creating a "Confederation of United Tribes." They hope to solicit the British for protection against French claims to the island, while also doing away with extraterritoriality the British settlers on the island enjoy. \n\nThe Maori chiefs are thankful for the British crown's efforts to officialize their nationhood by desgining a national flag, allowing them to legally trade with ports in New South Wales and Norfolk Island. But they may be terribly naive as to how willing Britain is to respect the independence of a small island nation ripe for colonizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BATTLEOFONCATIVO;La Plata is in an on-off civil war, with armies fighting for control of the virtually non-existent federal government. The conflict's two factions, one supporting unitarianism and the other federalism, clashed today in a battle in Oncativo, Córdoba Province. The Unitarian forces of General José María Paz pushed back the Federalist troops led by Facundo Quiroga, showing potential weakness for the Federalist forces led by Buenos Aires. The Federalists had attempted a march toward the Platine interior through Córdoba. With this foiled, the Unitarians may push into the coast--unless Federalist provincial governors unite in a coalition against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARIANLEAGUE;The general José María Paz has declared the formation of the Unitarian League, or the League of the Interior, comprising all the western interior provinces of La Plata. These provinces' leaders vow to restore the unitarian form of government previously held under Bernardino Rivadavia, our first president. After our war with Brazil, the office of the president was declared in an attempt to consolidate La Plata's constantly feuding provinces, each trying to maintain autonomy under their respective caudillos. Rivadavia's authority was firmly rejected by the other provinces. Our country has been run as a weakly-bound confederacy since then. \n\nIf the League of the Interior succeeds, La Plata will be transformed: we will truly begin to think of ourselves as a nation. Nevertheless, they are a threat. Their belligerance challenges the caudillos' authority--and they will defend their lands to the death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEDERALPACT;In response to the Unitarian League's formation, the governors of Buenos Aires, Entre Ríos, and Santa Fé have convened to sign the Federal Pact, pledging commitment to preserving the country's federalism. The pact was proposed by the Buenos Aires governor, Juan Manuel de Rosas, a de facto dictator who has enforced his will through a private militia to maintain supremacy over all the other provinces. \n\nEach of the Pact's members enjoys free trade with each other and a pledge of military protection from other provinces' invasions. It goes to show that La Plata's legal status is so far removed from its reality: it is a collection of virtually independent provinces at each others' throats. But if through federalism is how we are destined to survive, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNITARYLEAGUEWAR;Federalist General Ángel Pacheco has made his first move in an offensive against the Unitarians. His Buenos Aires division landed an ambush on Unitarian troops in the town of Fraile Muerto, in Córdoba province. His troops' tactical upper hand was further guaranteed by how the ambushed division, led by General José María Paz, contained many former Federalist troops who were captured by the Unitarians and forced to fight for their side. These troops then switched sides again and asisted Pacheco's army. Together they are marching through Córdoba, forcing a Unitarian retreat and spelling true peril for their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Having competed with both France and Spain for sovereignty over the islands, we are now left squabbling with the independent Argentine administration over whose countries rightfully deserves to control them. The Falklands' current Argentine governor, Luis Vernet, has ignored our diplomatic protests over the blocking of British fishing rights to the islands' coasts. With him in charge, the Falklands are sure to be consolidated under Argentine control, unless we use the military to retake them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Upon arriving, he instructed Admiral José María Pinedo, leader of the Malvinas fleet, to surrender all his ships to Britain and allow the Union Jack to be hoisted on the port's docks. Pinedo contemplated resisting, though his forces' numerical disadvantage made it futile. \n\nThe loss of our territory again, even after our defeat of the Spanish, to European colonialism is an affront to the nation.

BLACKWAR;Ever since Europeans arrived on Australia, there has been conflict between the native Aboriginal peoples and the colonizers. The Black War, or the Tasmanian War as some call it, has plagued the island since 1803 when the first major settlements were established. The Aboriginal's skirmishes with the colonists more than doubled in intensity during the 1820s as a result of the settlers' continued attempts at killing the native people. Between 1826 and 1828 there were multiple major massacres resulting in the deaths of 408 Aboriginal Tasmanians and 61 British settlers. In 1830, lieutenant-governor George Arthur ordered 2,200 men, consisting of soldiers and free citizens, to persecute and forcibly relocate four out of the nine Aboriginal nations into a reservation." The 31st of December 1831 officially marks the end of the Black War as the last resisting tribes whose numbers had dwindled to 28 people have surrendered after years of persecution and genocide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After independence, however, the capital switched to San José, to some protest that prompted the federal government to create four equal-status capitals. This changed when the current head of state, Braulio Carrillo Colina, repealed the Ambulance Law, cementing San José as the sole Costa Rican capital.

TITHEWAR;Tithe payments are a tax imposed on farmers in Ireland. They pay 10 percent of the value of their agricultural produce to the clergy for the sake of financing the church. This has been a rather unpopular tax within the Catholic Irish communities, resulting in multiple clashes and protests. The "war" took a turn in 1831 when the Irish Constabulary fired on people resisting payments, killing 12 and wounding another 20. This event led anti-tithe protestors to ambush 40 Constabularies, killing 12, including the Chief Constabulary.

The committee's military commander, Tafil Buzi, has called for his comerades to commence the liberation of all Albania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
france_trolling_portugal_title;Forcing Recognition by Portugal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
france_trolling_portugal_desc;Portugal's absolute monarch, Dom Miguel I, has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the July Monarchy. Miguel, nicknamed 'The Absolutist', abolished the constitution and became the total ruler of Portugal several years ago. This of course motivates him to not recognize our revolutionary monarch. With the OK of Britain and Spain who also oppose absolutism in Portugal, we may dispatch a naval expedition to Lisbon to use gunboat diplomacy to force Miguel's hand in the recognition of the July Monarchy. If not, our navy shall have a little target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANCEDEMANDSBINGCHILLING;Louis-Philippe, king of France, seized power in a revolution against Charles X of Bourbon in 1830. This illegitimate rebel king has now dispatched a naval squadron to demand we recognize his rule in a 48-hour ultimatum. Their navy may be more than a match for ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PORTUGALRECOGNIZESFRA;Dom Miguel I has recognized king Louis-Philippe and the July Monarchy under the threat of the guns of our naval squadron. While this admission is certainly not genuine, it still has the desired effect of bringing Portugal in line and further legitimizing the July Monarchy internationally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATTLETAGUS;Our navy has been obliterated by the French. Our only ship of the line, Dom João VI, was in such disrepair that it could not engage the French. The two frigates, Diana and Pérola, were massively outgunned by the three French ships of the line despite support by corvettes, brigs and a brigantine. Humiliatingly, the French have captured our ships as prizes to serve in their own navy. Maybe by agreeing to their initial demands we can save some of our ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LIBERALAZORES;The Liberal forces of Dom Pedro, ex-Emperor of Brazil and Regent for his daughter Maria da Glória, the claimant to the throne, have landed in the Azores and defeated our garrison. They dispute the legitimacy of Dom Miguel I and are supported by liberal agitants in Portugal who chafe under Dom Miguel I's absolutist rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DOMPEDRODED;Except for bouts of epilepsy that manifested in seizures every few years, Pedro had always enjoyed robust health. The war, however, undermined his constitution and he has now died of tuberculosis after a long and painful illness. One of his last acts was to dictate an open letter to Brazil: 'Slavery is an evil, and an attack against the rights and dignity of the human species, but its consequences are less harmful to those who suffer in captivity than to the Nation whose laws allow slavery. It is a cancer that devours its morality.' He will always be remembered for having ousted the tyrannical Dom Miguel I and having brought constitutionalism to Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINDELOLANDING;Liberal forces loyal to Dom Pedro have landed at Mindelo, seeking to overthrow his brother Dom Miguel, who has usurped the throne. With them, they have 60 ships and 7500 men, consisting of Constitutionalist forces loyal to Queen Maria II and her regent Dom Pedro, as well as a number of foreign volunteers. The landing caught the Absolutist forces by surprise, and Porto was captured swiftly thereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even though the Constitutionalist fleet was outnumbered by the Miguelites, the battle proved to be a decisive victory for the Liberal side. A bold tactic of closing in- and boarding the numerically superior Miguelite ships, Napier managed to secure Constitutionalist naval supremacy, as well as capturing 4 ships of the line, 1 frigate, and 1 corvette. The result of this engagement means the siege of Porto has been broken, and full out war will break out imminently!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our troops have been deployed to attack their position in three columns, commanded by Colonels Quierós, Nepomuceno and Vasconcelos, which were in turn led by Captain General António de Noronha who was responsible for the capture of Lisbon. The battle was a resounding success for our armies, resulting in Dom Miguel failing to rally his officers behind him for another battle.

LAGRANJA;Inspired by the 1830 French Revolution, exiled Spanish liberals have organized many unsuccessful military coups--known as pronunciamentos in Spanish--to re-establish the 1812 Constitution and end Fernando VII's absolute monarchy. The most notable of these was the pronunciamento of general José Torrijos, who ended up shot. The latest to occur was today, in the palace of La Granja, where King Fernando resides. On the 16th, Ferdinand's health took a turn for the worse, and he was expected to die at any moment. His wife, María Cristina, was then betrayed by the top brass in the army, who refused to acknowledge her regency. Thus, she influenced her husband to revoke the Pragmatic Sanction, preventing Carlos Isidro from ascending the throne. On the 18th, Fernando's father, Carlos IV, as regent annulled the Salic law of succession in the Spanish monarchy, attempting to make the royal line patrilineal. But today, unexpectedly, Ferdinand VII has recovered his health, dismissed ministers supporting Carlos's ascension, and repealed his father's decree, making Isabel the heir to the throne again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TORRIJOSPRONOUNCEMENT;Liberals launched another pronunciamento today in Málaga, though it failed after its organizers fell into a trap set by our navy and the captain general of Andalusia. In May, the insurgent general José María Torrijos presented his plan for this insurrection, consisting of a "circumferential" penetration of the country to attack the center, Madrid, from various points. They would pick up liberal sympathizers along the way to encircle the capital, hoping their numbers would suffice to overwhelm the Spanish army. But first, they were to cross into Spanish territory from Gibraltar, with Torrijos leading them, to signal the uprisings start. Málagas governor confided anonymously to Torrijos in September that the best place for the landing would be the coast of Málaga, where he would be assured of the support of local garrisons. On November 30th, two boats with sixty men headed by Torrijos left Gibraltar. They found their destination after forty hours of travelhowever, they were met with gunfire from the docked Spanish ship Neptune, and the conspirators have now all been executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FIRSTCARLISTWAR;Today, contingents of an ideology called "Carlism"--nicknamed after Fernando VII's brother and Spain's heir apparent, Carlos María Isidro--have taken up arms against the regency of María Cristina de Borbón. Catalonia, Aragon, Vasconia and Valencia run red with blood, and their populations, blinded by Carlism, are fighting for them. The Carlist uprisings are fueled by Fernando VII's death and the enactment of the Pragmatic Sanction, a liberal law to allow Isabel II to be the heir to the throne. For Isabel to take the throne instead of the megalomaniacal Carlos would mean a new era of prosperity for the nation. Viva Isabel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PRAGMATICSANCTION1830;Today, the Spanish government has published the contents of the 1789 Pragmatic Sanction, passed in that year unanimously by the court, which reinstates the traditional system of succession and abandons that which Felipe V introduced in 1713. From the year of its passing until now, the Sanction never would be revealed to the public and, therefore, had no legal validity. After the death of his third wife, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, King Fernando VII announced in September 1829 that he would marry again. He chose the Neapolitan princess María Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies as his bride, despite her being his niece and twenty-two years his younger. They married on December 10th that year. A few months later Fernando would declare the Pragmatic Sanction of 1789 fully in effect, ensuring that his eldest childeven if they were a girlwould succeed him. The decree has produced discontent among those would desire Carlos María Isidro, Fernandos brother, to succeed to the thronethus creating the Carlist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTICLERICALRIOTS1835;A series of riots against the clergy, inspired by the massacre of friars in Madrid produced a year ago, have begun to sow chaos in Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia. The violence is motivated by the clergy's support for Carlism and its work to suppress liberalism. By order of Valencias captain general, the archbishop of Barcelona left the country with a military escort and took refuge in Bordeaux, France. He escaped before being able to see the violence reach new heights of bloodshed, with no end in sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ROYALSTATUTE1834;Regent María Cristina de Borbón has issued a new Royal degree to overhaul Spains federal government. The decree introduces a bicameral legislature to Spain. It consists of the Estate of Próceres, whose members will be appointed by royalty and the high nobility, and an Estate of Solicitors, whose members will be elected by a vote of 16,000 people, less than 2% of the country's population. The decree clearly takes inspiration from the British parliamentary system. Being conservative in nature, the statute has pleased both reactionaries and conservatives, among them Carlists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Somewhat famous for inbreeding, the genetics of the Spanish house of Bourbon cursed Fernando to, despite having been married four times since 1802, have difficulty in having children. Indeed, his parents were cousins, his first marriage was to a cousin and his second and fourth marriages to nieces. Finally, in 1830, Isabel II was born and designated as his heir by the Pragmatic Sanction. However, as his brother, Carlos María Isidro de Borbón, has refused to accept Isabel II's legitimacy, his death has left a succession crisis behindwith one of the factions, the Carlists, already beginning to show signs of an impending rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the former conservative Bermudists joining his cause against the liberal Orbegoso, Salaverry has taken control of most of Peru with little resistance. However, Orbegoso's main base of support in the liberal South has refused to recognize Salaverry's authority.

Panduranga officials have recently been supporting the rival faction of Le Van Duyet, in defiance of the Vietnamese suzerain.

KATIPSUMAT;Recently, rumors have been brought to light that the Cham Muslim leader Katip Sumat has spent the early months of 1833 gathering his followers in a remote base in the countryside. Demanding from his followers "absolute loyalty to Allah and Islam," he had been preaching the Quran and disseminating Islamism, defending the establishment of an Islamist Vietnam and a jihad against the Nguyen dynasty. With their flags raised, and the words Po Rasak written upon them  meaning His Great Glorious Wonderful  a clear implication for either Allah or the prophet Muhammad, the rebels have just launched attacks against Vietnamese tax register centers and military garrisons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JATHAKWA;Following our suppression of Katip Sumats Islamist uprising in the summer of last year, the Cham people are once again acting against our rule, and it appears that they are being supported by the Montagnards. Attacking our provinces from Binh Tuan to Phu Yuen, reports reveal that Ja Thak Wa, a Cham Muslim cleric, is the leader of this revolt. It seems that his main interest is in proclaiming a new Champa dynasty, as he has announced that Po War Palei, the son-in-law of the last deputy ruler of the Champa, as the new King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHAMGENOCIDE;Minh Mang, Emperor of Vietnam, had dispatched over 3,000 troops to deal with the Cham rebels since the beginning of the uprisings in the region. The monarch had promised good remittances for soldiers who killed and beheaded rebels, and a wave of massacres and systematic killings took the Cham people by a storm. Slow slicing and rampant mass killings allowed the fury of Vietnamese troops to turn into a de facto ethnocide in Champa, with competitions between the Vietnamese royal troops and Kinh paramilitary units. By the summer of 1835, the Champa king, Po War Lei, was killed in action, and Ja Thak Wa was captured by Vietnamese troops and sentenced to death. Seven to twelve Cham villages were scrambled to the ground, and the murders and exile of other revolutionaries such as Po Phoak The, and the demolition of Cham temples, cemeteries and villages, signals the end of large-scale Cham revolts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GEORGEIVDED;His Majesty, George IV of the United Kingdom, has passed away today, in 1830. Born in 1762, crowned King in 1820, and dead in 1830, George was known for his absurd eating habits, his vast consumption of alcohol and his usage of laudanum to ease chronic pains. Weighing 280 pounds at his passing, George had arteriosclerosis, gout and suffered, like his father, from cataracts. The Scottish artist David Wilkie had remarked that the monarch looked like a great sausage stuffed into the covering due to his immense size. Having a rule marked by scandal due to his mistresses, his financial extravagance and a selfish, unreliable and irresponsive personality, George gradually grew ill due to his awful habits, with intensifying coughs at the time of his death. Clutching his stomach, the King died from an upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from the rupture of a blood vessel in his stomach. According to some versions, Georges last words were: my boy [to his page], this is death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOUISIDED;Grand Duke Ludwig I of Baden has died at the age of 67, leaving the succession of his titles in the hands of his half-brother, Leopold. His life accomplishments during his reign include securing the continued existence of the University of Freiburg, and founding the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe which will go on to become the oldest technical school in Germany. Ludwigs death means the extinction of his line in the Baden family. There has been much gossiping and rumor-fabrication surrounding his death, some saying that a mysterious 17 year old man named Kaspar Hauser who appeared in 1828 is the illegitimate son of Ludwig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LUDWIGHESSEDED;The Grand Duke Ludwig I of Hessen-Darmstadt has passed away at the age of 76. Succeeding his father, Ludwig IX, Ludwig I was elevated to Grand Duke of Hesse in 1806, due to allying Napoleon I, and joined the Confederation of the Rhine. During the Congress of Vienna, Ludwig would lose his Westphalian territories, but was compensated with the district of Rheinhessen. Because of this acquired territory, he changed his title to Grand Duke of Hesse by the Rhine. He is succeeded by his eldest son, Ludwig II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Baden Estates have come to a resolution to finally begin the abolition of this ancient practice, allowing for estates to forgo tithing in exchange for a compensatory pension equivalent to twenty times a tithe's appraised annual value, with twenty percent of this pension being supplied by a state tithe replacement fund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BYECHARLESBRUNSWICK;While Charles II of Brunswick technically reigned for 15 years, over half of it was through the prince-regent of Great Britain and Hanover. Charles was set to take the throne at the age of 19. However, when he turned 18, Hanover rushed through constitutional reforms that limited his powers, redefined his duchy, hereditary lands and due income. Charles ended his regency early, declaring in an edict that Hanover was a usurper and that the new constitution imposed by it was invalid because it limited his powers and went against all international norms of law, causing outrage in Hanover and England. The German Confederation attempted to intervene in the matter and ordered Charles to accept the new constitution, which he promptly disregarded, keeping Brunswick an absolute monarchy. This year, however, amidst the July Revolution, Charles' absolutism has been getting less popular in Brunswick, culminating in a large mob breaking into the palace to overthrow him, placing his brother William as Duke in his stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOTTINGERREV;Liberal citizens of Göttingen started an armed uprising on the 8th of January with the goal of abolishing the feudal governing system. The uprising was quenched on the 16th of January, while the general state of the rest of Hanover remained calm. The reason for the uproar in Göttingen looks to be related to a widespread hatred for a specific book, written by Friedrich Wilhelm Boldewin von dem Knesebeck in praise of the nobility as a preserver of stability. Friedrich implied that stronger surveillance against liberal advocates was necessary, which seems to have been the cause of the recent troubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAX1830REV;1827 marked the death of King Friedrich August I, who was succeeded by King Anton. Anton has so far failed to enact any reforms throughout his 3 years of rule, but this has primarily been blamed on the cabinet minister Detlev von Einsiedel who remains the politically dominant figure within the Kingdom. In June, many of our subjects started outspokenly criticizing the current regime's lack of liberal reforms, primarily in Leipzig where the 300th anniversary of the Confessio Augustana of 1530 was being celebrated. Many felt the ban on wearing student uniforms- a symbol of liberalism- was a form of harassment, and have taken to the streets in protest. Local authorities dispatched police, which increased liberal resistance even further. After the July Revolution in France, protests have started to become more common, with the Leipzig protest repeating in September. From Leipzig, unrest has more recently begun spreading to other cities, such as Dresden. King Anton has now convened a security commission, seeking to deal with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_saxonia_title;The Saxon Constitution of 1831;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_saxonia_desc;A new constitution has been proposed by King Anton and Prince co-regent Frederick Augustus II, which would transform the Kingdom of Saxony into a parliamentary monarchy. The king would be head of the government, but could not become ruler of another state (save by blood inheritance) without consent of the Diet or parliament. The king's decrees have to be countersigned by at least one of his ministers, and without it, none of the king's acts could be considered valid. The king would have supreme power over religious matters, and could overrule any judgement delivered in court of law. The king has the power to promote laws, and without his consent no proposals for laws may be passed in the Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

champa_jihad_desc;The Cham people have proven themselves resilient, with dedication to Allah and characteristic determination, against the imperial ambitions of Vietnam. Now Katip Sumat, an Islamist leader and preacher who demands absolute loyalty to Allah and Islam, calls for jihad against the barbarians to the north. Tired of the tyranny of the Vietnamese, our soldiers have voluntarily been waving black banners and calling for war. If Po Phaok The, King of the Cham, accepts the call for holy warfare against the northern invaders, the house of Islam will be expanded, and peace will be guaranteed for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INVASIONOFSYRIA;The ambitious Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt has long been plotting to invade our Syrian provinces. In the revolt of the Greeks against our rule, we enlisted his help in crushing them in return for the promise of giving Egypt sovereignty over Crete, Cyprus and Morea. However, as the joint Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet intervened in the Battle of Navarino and sank the Egyptian navy, leading to our defeat in the war. Now, the scheming Muhammad Ali has declared war on us, using their lack of compensation for intervening in Greece as a casus belli, as he never received Crete, Cyprus or Morea. With his recent reforms of administration and army organization, his forces pose a legitimate threat to the levant. We must rally our forces and crush Egypt once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CENTRALITALYORDER;The Italian United Provinces have been thoroughly crushed. Outmatched on the battlefield, the irregular Italian militia were easily defeated. Habsburg forces have retaken the key revolutionary cities and re-established the status quo antebellum, ending the dream of a united Italy -- for now. Only time will tell when the flames of revolution will once again engulf the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UCALIBERALSTHIRTYFIVE;José Gregorio Salazar y Castro, a conservative, won the election of 1834 and became supreme leader of the Federal Republic of Central America. However, the El Salvador-based liberals have been becoming ever more influential in the federation's legislative assembly. They have now used their power to declare the election results null with bogous claims of electoral fraud. Gregorio has sullenly agreed to hand over supreme command to Francisco Morazán, head of the liberals. The new government has even relocated the capital from Guatemala to El Salvador, solidifying its new seat of power. While the liberals are celebrating their successful takeover, the conservatives are plotting their revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAVOIEINVASION;Several Mazzinian exiles have attempted to overthrow King Vittorio Emmanuele I. They accused the Sovereign of consolidating central power for himself, giving life to an absolutism that would not have admitted opposition. The revolt involved an invasion of Savoy from the French border and direct action from infamous Italian republican Giuseppe Garibaldi, who would organize a revolt within the Kingdoms fleet and meet them up with the invaders. \n\nBut the Piedmontese troops expected an invasion for some time, thanks to some information reports received beyond the border. In fact, leading insurgent general Girolamo Ramorino immediately realized the impossibility of the success of the plan, both the invasion of Savoy and Garibaldi's  mutiny. The rebellions failure led to some of its organizers, such as Ramorino and fellow general Giovanni Battista Scapaccino, to renounce their republican ideals and defect again to the monarchy. Garibaldi, meanwhile, has gone back into hiding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_title;The Kurhessische Verfassung;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_1831_kassel_desc;A new constitution modeled to some extent after that of England, has been supported by the Elector. This new constitution would establish a popular representation in a Diet or Congress of the provinces, and would extend liberty of speech and that of the press. The constitution would also seek to separate royal and state revenues, and make ministers swear an oath to the constitution, as well as implementing an impeachment system for ministers who break their oath. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_title;The Staatgrundgesetz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
staatsgrundgesetz_hanova_desc;The Staatsgrundgesetz, a constitution proposed by the estates and supported by cabinet minister Caspar Detlev von Schulte would liberalize our monarchy to appease the left and prevent a repetition of the events of 1830. It would combine the Generalsteuerkasse with the Königliche Generalkasse to a singular Steuerkasse and give the power to set our country's budget to the estates. The city of Hannover's magistrates that the government currently appoints would be made independent with a simple government veto right to their appointment, giving the city more autonomy. More importantly, it would open the upper house of the estates to farmers and the middle class. While staunch conservatives oppose this constitution, it is clearly necessary to maintain the stability of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAPODISTRASDED;Ex-foreign minister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia - and first governor of Greece - Ioannis Kapodistrias, has just been murdered on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplion. His assassination was carried out by the disgruntled brother and son of one Petrobey Mavromichalis (a popular and successful leader in the uprising against Ottoman rule), whose imprisonment had been ordered by Kapodistrias. Konstantinos- Ioannis brother, and Ioannis son Georgios waited on the steps of the church, and killed Kapodistrias by stabbing him in the chest, and consecutively shooting him in the head. After the deed, Konstantis was shot by general Fotomaris, who witnessed the murder from his window. Georgios, however, had slipped away from the scene and would only surrender to authorities days later. He was subsequently put to death by firing squad, his last words being: Peace Brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

althorpact_desc;The Factory Act, or Althorps Act, would seek to establish a regular working day, specifically for children in the workforce. Children through the ages 9-12 are limited to 48 hours of work per week, children under the age of 9 would not be allowed in factories (apart from silk mills), children under the age of 18 are not allowed to work at night, children through the ages 9-13 must not work more than 8 hours a day with an hour lunchbreak, children through the ages 14-18 must not work more than 12 hours with an hour lunchbreak. The Act would also establish a Factory Inspectorate, and allow for routine factory inspections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALAWITEREV;While having been relatively content with autonomous rule in the mountains of Latakia, the Alawis within our borders have started organizing an uprising at a scale we have yet to see. The cause of the recent unrest is partly due to the call for mass mobilization by Muhammad Ali, which upset the Alawites who remain loyal to the Ottomans. During a march of Egyptian soldiers from Aleppo to Latakia some 4,000 Alawi militants attacked the column, forcing the Egyptians to retreat to Latakia. The Alawite forces pursued, and laid siege to Latakia, causing much damage and monetary loss. We need to act now to return order to our rebellious provinces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PEASANTSPALESTINEREVOLT;Egypt's war effort against the Ottomans has led to extreme unrest in Palestine. To gather an army capable of marching to Constantinople, Ibrahim Pasha has ordered a fifth of all Muslims under Egyptian rule to be conscripted, including those in the now-conquered Levant. With this extensive draft has come high taxes that are draining the income of Levantine Arab peasants. These peasants, not owning land of their own, receive housing on the farms they tend to by their landlord and are meanwhile paid a subsistence wage that cannot survive high taxing.\n\nWith these factors contributing to huge unrest, the Palestinian sheikh Qasim al-Ahmad has ordered his followers to disobey the Egyptian draft orders and refuse to pay these taxes. Peasants and nobles alike have declared an open revolt, storming cities such as Hebron, Nablus, and Safed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPANISHCHOLERA;It's been nine months since cholera hit France, and our authorities knew it was only a matter of time before it came to Spain as well. Over the past month, cholera was reported in Vigo, Galicia, which now hosts the majority of cases in all the country. The outbreak initially was caused by the landing of auxiliary troops in Portugal, where the War of Portuguese Succession still rages on. Almost instantly another outbreak emerged in Barcelona. But cases are spreading most widely in the south, where thousands of deaths have occurred. The plague is bringing winds of rebellion to the population, who resent the government's poor response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ODAALAPATRIA;A poem in Catalan entitled 'La Pàtria,' or 'The Homeland' in English, by Carles Aribau, has been published recently. The poem is fueling the rebirth of Catalan as a literary language and, thus, its re-emergence in everyday use. It tells of the longing for an independent Catalonia and exalts the Catalan language--a clear threat to the unity of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRANKFURTERWACHENSTURM;There is a spectre haunting Germany--that of liberalism--and its effects are becoming more and more visible. Today, fifty students stormed Frankfurt's Hauptwache and Konstablerwache police offices, attempting to gain access to the German Confederacy's treasury. This, in turn, would enable them to hold the Confederacy's leadership hostage and force the German states' unification. The police summarily apprehended the perpetrators. Eight of them, however, escaped to the United States. \n\nIt remains to be seen how much more influence these revolutionaries' circles will gain in Germany. One of the groups participating in the attack, the Burschenschaft, will not rest until Germany becomes a single political entity for the first time in over a millennium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RESTORERSARGQUOTEUNQUOTE;A dreary silence hangs over Buenos Aires, the calm forced upon a city after the sudden topple of the provincial government. The previously-elected governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Ramón Balcarce, has been been deposed and replaced with Juan José Viamonte, a crony of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Balcarce provoked the anger of the Rosas-supporting federalists after announcing that Rosas would be tried for treason, having seized absolute power during his governance from 1829 to 1832. Thus, a contingent of federalists immediately headed for Buenos Aires from Rosas' military campaign in the Pampas and threatened to forcibly oust Balcarce. Rosas' wife, Encarnación Ezcurra, worked behind the scenes to ensure further military support for the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SOSHANGANELIKESTROLLING;Word has reached us that Zulu King Dingane kaSenzangakhona has attacked the Portuguese fort at Lourenço Marques. The garrison had apparently already largely fled and didn't put up a fight, allowing the victorious Zulu to sack the settlement and return to their lands in the South. This now leaves a power vacuum: With the Portuguese crushed and the Zulu horde headed back South, the coast is undefended and ripe for the picking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOSHANGANEREKT;Disaster has struck our settlement in Lourenço Marques. The prosperous slave trading port has long been our center of control over the southern coast of Mozambique and central hub of the commerce taking place in nearby trading posts. The initial calamity was Zulu King Dingane kaSenzangakhona's recent sudden attack on the settlement. A large portion of the garrison fled the fort along with governor Dionísio António Ribeiro who was later hunted down and killed. The remaining token force surrendered to the invaders without a fight, leaving the Zulu to plunder Lourenço Marques. After the Zulus returned to their lands in the South, a new force arrived from the North: The Gaza Kingdom under Soshangane. Not only did he expel the remainder of our forces from the southern coast, he even crushed an expedition from Sofala, forcing our several of our colonial districts to recognize him as king and pay him tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00001;The Maroto Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00001;Rafael Maroto was a renowned Spanish General in the American Wars of Independence, and a distinct royalist in his loyalties, pledging himself to Don Carlos after resigning from military command in 1833 and being imprisoned by the liberal government for six months. In following years he proved to be a loyal commander, albeit one that remained at great odds with the conduct of Carlist forces, leading to defeats due to infighting and court intrigue. A decree proclaiming him a traitor responsible for the deaths of several high ranking officials in the early conflict was issued to Don Carlos. Only a short time later, with the complete non-compliance of the Carlist armed forces surrounding Maroto was this decree ultimately reneged. Maroto has stated: 'I have triumphed over the arbitrariness, injustice, and blindness of a prince. History will judge me in due course.' This is a huge humiliation to Carlism and has lead to the formation of a Marotist party within our ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00016;The Fueros Debate - Carlos of Molina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00016;The issue of the Fueros is one of great contention amongst the peoples of the Kingdom of Spain, and the root of the divide between the Carlists and the Christinos. While the Christinos sought the devolution and assimilation of the fueros into the Spanish crown, the root of the Carlist movement seeks to protect the regional legal systems and minority rights indicative of the fueros system. With the success of Carlos V in asserting his claim to the Spanish throne, the issue of the Fueros has been put aside, for now, and the fueros will maintain their autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00016;Their autonomy is secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00017;The Fueros Debate - Carlos VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00017;With the ascension of a new monarch to the Spanish throne comes a renewal of the fueros debate in the Spanish nation. A traditionalist at heart, much like his predecessor, he seeks to elevate the fueros and bring them to par with the rest of the Spanish country. To accomplish this, a legal reform program has been pushed forwards by the crown to achieve this end. It has proven more than popular amongst the catalan and basque peoples, but has itself become a controversy in the Castilian portion of the kingdom. The reform package seeks to modernize and codify the fueros further in Spanish law, trimming their long list of priveleges of unnecessary and archaic legal structures, while solidifying their status and rendering them all but immutable in the Spanish crown. As such, this reform will greatly increase the militancy of liberals across the kingdom who seek the abolishment of the fueros outright, while rendering the fueros themselves more efficient in their governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00017;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00017;There is no need to reform them now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00018;Carlos VI's Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00018;With the first stage of the reform package set through, the king's full ambition is becoming apparent - a total reform of the monarchial structure of Spain, integrating the fueros as an established legal structure throughout the Spanish nation, and codifying their existence as integral to Spain. To accomplish this, each Fuero will be reorganized into separate crownlands, held as a personal demesne of the king, but fully integrated under the crown of Spain. This places the Basque, Catalan, and Galician regions under direct Carlist rule, irrespective of the legislature in Madrid. In turn, trade restrictions and customs borders will be devolved between the crownlands and the rest of the country, whereas the rights of Catalans and Basques to organize their own military and govern their own lands remain intact indefinitely. In effect, this reform package sees a potential solution to the Fueros debate altogether, but will further anger the liberals, perhaps to the point of revolution. The reform scheme is held as overly ambitious even among some Carlists. §RWill result in a revolt§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00019;It has been no secret that Carlos VI's reforms have been of immense controversy in the past few weeks, particularly among the people centering around Madrid, many of whom have flocked to the liberal Christino banners in reaction to what they perceive as a betrayal of Spanish interests in the interest of minorities that they see as rightfully subservient. This unrest has hit a recent high pitch with an attempted assassination of the king as he was on a street parade in Madrid. A gunman attempted to fire upon him, only narrowly missing before police dispatched and disarmed the man. It appears that even within the heartland of Spain, the king does not remain safe. This does not bode well for if the reforms are expanded upon, as he plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00019;The fires of revolution are stoked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00020;The Flames of Liberalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00020;Carlos VI has been nothing short of controversial since before he ever ascended the throne, as could be said for any Spanish monarchs in this time. While conservatives and traditionalists find the Carlist cause to be a banner to flock to, a realm of continued stability in the face of the tumultuous reform and change of the French and Portuguese, and a beacon for restored Spanish prestige in a modern age, the liberals see it as a counterrevolutionary reaction, an outdated regime of a bygone era. With the passage of the reform package championed by the king, this has exploded into open revolt across the Castilian countryside in reaction. While the unpopularity of these measures was already known, it has quickly become apparent that the reaction is far more dangerous than anticipated, especially as the calls of these locals have turned from not just declarations against the Carlists, but to declarations against the Spanish monarchy altogether. With the fires of this revolution stoked, it seems likely that a revolution has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00020;The banners of war beckon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00021;Carlos VI Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00021;Carlos VI has emerged triumphant in the face of the liberal opposition to his reforms, and yes, to his rule. His power greatly expanded in the face of the Liberal defeat, he has been granted full power to enact his rule over all of Spain, and indeed, to not only expand his reforms to the whole of the country, but to undo what reforms the Liberals had until that point forced onto the government. His power made absolute, Carlos has found bearing to solidify his reign in a manner more comprehensive than even the Ancien Regime, a truly modern monarchy led benevolently by his rule, at least in the minds of some. Liberals chafe under his rule, but it will be unlikely that they will pose a significant threat again in this lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00021;The Kingdom of Spain stands strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00022;The Liberal Triumph;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00022;In the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, the Carlist usurpers have been driven from the throne of Spain, and in their place a liberal republic has been proclaimed, ready to bring about a restoration of liberty to the Iberian peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00022;The Republic has been victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00023;The Fueros Debate - Juan III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00023;With the ascension of Juan III to the Spanish throne, the Fueros debate has regrettably taken up public discourse once again. As Carlos VI failed to bring any lasting change to the Fueros situation, the debate now falls into the hands of the current king to push forwards his vision for what shall be done. Unlike prior Carlist claimants, however, his views have controversially followed along with those of the Christinos in many regards, and as such he views the Fueros as a wholly outdated relic of a feudal past, not worth reforming, but rather total abolishment. To reach these ends, he is pushing forwards a reform program to increase the efficiency of the Fueros, substantially limiting their autonomy and reducing their legal protections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00023;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00023;No need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00024;Juan III's Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00024;With the initial passing of Juan III's reforms, it has quickly become clear that his actions have awoken a vehement response from the Basque and Catalan minorities of the kingdom. The threatening of their long-held privelegia is widely viewed as a direct violation of their cultural identities, and evidence of unrightful Castilian oppression of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula. To continue with these reforms will no doubt result in a falling-out with the Basque and Catalan minorities altogether, opening a rift that may well never close again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00024;Their opposition means little. Abolish the Fueros.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00024;Enough with this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00025;Unrest in Catalonia and the Basque Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00025;With the recent reform package passed by Juan III, in preparation to completely abolish the fueros, a riot has broken out in the city of Barcelona in response to this perceived betrayal by the Spanish monarchy that has sworn to uphold the rights and interests of the fueros since its onset, and has now begun reducing the rights of these communities in a matter irrespective of this pledge. The riot bodes ill for the fate of relations between the Spanish and the Catalans and Basques, should the reforms continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00025;Can't they just Basque in the glory of Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00026;The Rise of Catalan and Basque Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00026;With the abolishing of the fueros, the protections for the minorities of Spain have been abolished by the central government, placing them fully under the authority of Madrid's wishes, irrespective of what these groups desire for themselves. In response, the idea of nationhood has arisen among these populations, who now see Spain as an oppressive foreign entity, and not representative of their national identities, which are now viewed as fundamentally separate from that of Spain itself. It is doubtful that this rift can ever be closed again in this current era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00026;So it will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00027;The Fueros Debate - Carlos VII;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00027;On the ascension of Carlos VII, the fueros debate has come up once again, and quite possibly for the last time in this era of history. By this point the Fueros have become, even in Victorian standards, highly established in society at large. Carlos VII is a Carlist in the most traditional sense, viewing the Fueros as an integral part of Spanish society, and indeed, not well-respected enough. As such, he seeks to not only preserve, but expand the privelegia of the fueros into full-scale autonomy and confederalism, devolving Spanish control into a mere rubber stamp for their own, largely independent actions. To accomplish this, the king has pressed forwards a reform program to steadily begin increasing their autonomy in local affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00027;Reform is needed with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00027;MORE autonomy? No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00028;Carlos VII's Solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00028;With the increased autonomy granted to the fueros by the first reforms, Carlos VII has pressed forwards a reform program to finally evolve the Fueros system into a true autonomy granted to the Catalan and Basque. This will obviously render Madrid and the king both incapable of governing these provinces directly altogether, and will take a great deal of time to mitigate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00028;True freedom at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00028;This is unnecessary. The Fueros will remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00036;The Resolution of the Fueros Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00036;With one of several potential solutions finally pushed forwards, regardless of the consequences, the Fueros Debate has finally been resolved. With this accomplished, the debate has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00036;Finally, peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00037;The Papacy Under Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00037;In the height of Spanish supremacy in western europe, it maintained itself as the predominant defender of Catholic interests across the European continent, a sentiment that the traditionalist Carlists share greatly. In the wake of Italian unification, the Holy See has found itself greatly reduced, and indeed all but completely removed from the landscape of European politics. While Italy assures Europe that the religious authority of the Pope has in no way been diminished, this nationalistic order exists at potentially great detriment to the moral and traditional fabric of society, and must be dealt with swiftly if it is to be rectified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00037;We must act immediately! §RGain 5 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00037;Who cares about the Pope?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00038;The Ecclesiastical War - Spanish Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00038;As the guns settle in the Mediterranean, the Carlist forces have come out as clearly triumphant in the struggle over the soul of Catholic Europe. As such, we now have the option of dictating terms from a favorable position. Should we so choose, we can simply restore the Pope to his distinguished position on the peninsula, though this has been criticized as a far from permanent solution, as Italy could simply recover it later. Alternatively, we could enforce the Pope as the de facto head of the Italian nation itself, whilst claiming the islands of Sardinia and Sicily to ensure that this treaty can be enforced. Still more particularly militaristic advisors suggest that Italy be partitioned in its entirety, with the Pope being placed in charge of all his traditional holdings, whilst we ourselves lay claim to the rest of the peninsula in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00039;Spanish Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00039;With the conclusion of the Spanish intervention in the Italian peninsula, we have been forced out of the city of Rome altogether, and our nation has been split in two. With our nation no longer properly united, and Rome back under Papal rule, we must now choose a new capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00039;Milan is our capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA00042;We take what is owed us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00043;The Sacrilege Controversy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00043;In the 1820s, under a royaliste supermajority, the Sacrilege laws were passed, rendering the acts of blasphemy and sacrilege illegal, under penalty of anything from forced labour to death. This highly controversial law has rarely been enforced, but has remained a prominent source of criticism against the highly religious government in Paris. This controversy has recently been reignited with the case of a known liberal agitator, an atheist, who has stolen several items from the local diocese, defaced them, then later returned them in a form of protest against the government. According to the law, he is meant to be executed, although this will undoubtedly anger the liberal population. To refuse to enforce the law in this case will in turn undermine its legitimacy. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00043;Enforce the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00043;Let it slide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00044;Intervention in Belgium?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00044;In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, France was forced to cede the region of Belgium to the Netherlands, in order to turn the latter into a proper balancing power against potentially renewed French expansionism. These culturally French and religiously Catholic lands quickly began to chafe under Dutch rule, and have now risen in revolt against their prior overlords. With their control quickly slipping, the opportunity has come for us to make an offer: we restore order to Belgium, and in return Wallonia is returned to French rule, while Flanders is restored to the Netherlands, a deal the beleagured Dutch are quite likely to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00044;Send the offer. §RGain 5 infamy§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00044;Wallonia is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00045;Intervention in Belgium?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00045;In the midst of our catastrophic civil war, an offer has come by the French, opportunistically seeking the return of its lost Belgian territories. Should we accept this offer, the French will doubtlessly restore order to the lost provinces, but it will come at a great cost, that of Wallonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00045;We have little choice, accept the French offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00045;The cost is too high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00046;The Dutch Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00049;Instability of the Bourbon Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00049;Despite the great unpopularity of the Bourbon monarchy, it has managed to weather the storm of public opinion, and has secured itself in place as a rightful continuation of the Ancien Regime before it. However, despite this, the liberal sect of the populace remains at great odds with the royalist powers that be, and this does not portend the end of instability within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00049;We will endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00050;Succession of Louis XIX;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00050;The late Charles X's health has been declining rapidly as of late, and with his old age it has become apparent that his end is nigh. As such, it has been decided that Charles X will abdicate in his dying days, leaving the throne to his heir presumptive, who will become known as Louis XIX. His legacy is one of both restoration and rot, the restoration of the old traditions and beliefs of France, but the rot of the very same liberties that the French people attained in the Revolution, his opposition to liberal reforms being the hallmark of his reign. Nevertheless, he will rest with his fathers before him, a king of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00050;Long live the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00051;The Death of Louis XIX;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00051;After just a short eight years of rule, Louis XIX has been found dead in his quarters. A man of military stature, he was at the forefront of anti-Bonapartiste sentiment in France, and was a major spearhead of the Bourbon restoration in France when he landed in Bourdeaux, and subsequently led Royaliste forces under the king for many years, even intervening in Spain during its own tumultuous fight against liberal elements. Now, however, aftr such a short reign, and in the midst of ever-increasing liberal agitation, he leaves his throne to Henri V.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00051;May his reign last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00056;The Land Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00056;In the years following the Bourbon Restoration, fears have spiked amongst peasants that noble elites' old feudal privileges will be restored, and the rights granted to the people by the French Revolution will be done away with by the Ancien Regime. In recent months this fear has appeared to become quite justified, as a controversy rocks the kingdom regarding a legal dispute between a petty nobleman and a small collective of businessmen over a territory they bought, albeit from peasants confiscated it from the nobleman during the Revolution. The nobleman demanded that the land be returned to him, as well as the profits of the unlawful sale, citing his rightful ownership of the land. The courts, staffed with royalist sympathizers, quickly ruled in favor of the nobleman. This event has become a fiasco, not just as other noblemen similarly deprived of land and status have begun making demands of a similar caliber, but as liberals have become increasingly agitated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00056;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00057;Nobility in the Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00057;Up until recently, France has been reliant on a military structure inherited from the days of the Bonaparte usurpation, promoted via merit rather than social status, and a conscription system that allows for a much larger military than the purely standing armies of days gone past. However, these reforms have come at a great cost to the political stability of the French realm, as many of the officers are no longer loyal to the king, and most have their loyalties placed with the Bonapartes they were hired from. This has caused for the French realm a situation wherein the keys to maintaining government power are largely placed in the hands of those that do not want to see the current government in power to begin with. The current administration has therefore suggested a series of reforms, seeking to dissolve the levy en masse altogether, and initiate a purge of Bonapartiste sympathizers in the military staff. This will undoubtedly weaken the military unduly, but may well save the throne from future insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00057;This is ludicrous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00057;A brilliant plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00058;Republican Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00058;The army's loyalties have been held in question for a long time now, and now it has come to pass that these fears be proven justified. A Republican sect of the army has committed mutiny, and now is poised to seize control of the French countryside in the south of the country. While loyalist support in the military flocks north to regroup around Paris, this portends a civil war that could well cripple the French state for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00058;For the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00059;Coup Attempt thwarted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00059;The army's loyalties have been held in question for some time, even after the reforms passed by the late Louis XIX to reorganize their structure to better benefit the crown. As of recent, those fears have largely been put to rest, as a planned Republican coup was swiftly foiled by the royal army, having discovered the traitorous plot before it could be enacted. With renewed faith in the armed forces, the station of the Bourbon monarchy is finally secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00059;Long Live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00060;Bourbon Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00060;With the guns finally going silent across continental France, it has become clear now that the Bourbon realm will be one to last. It has survived the liberal onslaught and the Ancien Regime remains intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00060;Vive la Bourbon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00061;Republican Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00061;As the guns go silent across continental France, the last faction standing has shown itself to be that of the French Republic. Liberalism has finally triumphed, and the Ancien Regime is no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00061;Vive La France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00062;The Arpitan Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00062;One place that the Bourbons have not expected to see resistance is the region of Arpitania, bordering the Swiss Commonwealth. Yet, as of late, liberal rebels have seized control of a decent part of the countryside, rebelling in the name of a so-called 'Arpitan Republic', under the hopes of joining Switzerland. These odd demands have left the government baffled, yet we have little choice but to put down this uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00062;Put down the uprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00062;For Liberty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00064;Securing France;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00064;With the liberals soundly defeated in France, the Bourbon realm has found itself secure in its position, free to solve its internal disputes however it sees fit. First on the drawing board is how to deal with the liberal rot that has infested the French crown since the first rioters hit the streets in the Revolution. While the most radical of the Legitimiste supporters in the realm see fit to wholly do away with all liberalized reform and bring back the Ancien Regime in full, other more moderate parties see this as a surefire way to simply cause another such crisis again in the future, and hope to chase a more moderate approach, seeing as how the revolution cannot so easily be undone. Still, some others find it fit to seek complete reconciliation with the liberals of the realm, and remodel the Bourbon monarchy into a truly modern, liberalizing force that the French people can surely back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00065;Resolving the Land Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00065;The land crisis that began in the 1830s has become an increasingly large pain in the side of the Bourbon administration, torn between the pull of popular opinion and modernization, and the opinions of the aristocracy that make up the backbone of the monarchy's support. With the continuing introduction of more efficient technologies into the French economy, the government finally has an opportunity to bring a definitive end to the agricultural crisis, but the question remains as to whom the remaining outstanding claims will revert to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00065;The land rightfully belongs to the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00065;Maybe the Carlists were onto something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00065;We shall simply forbid the reclamation efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00066;La Légion Royale;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00066;As the years have worn on after the purge of the upper staff, followed by extensive investment into the armed forces and modernization of its structure, the upper staff has finally recovered from the purges instituted in years past, and furthermore has become a well-maintained core staff akin to the Prussian model. While the army may never be able to reinstate the levy en masse, for fear of the same political instability coming to light again, the professional army may now prove sufficient to service the crown well enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00066;Finally, an army to be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00066;We are satisfied with simple loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00075;German Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00075;The Bourbon realm, always fearing for its continued security, has a unique opportunity in front of it. Prussia and Austria are both coming to blows in Central Europe, and France plays a key role in the region that could decisively shift the balance of power in its favor. The Bourbons, always keen to back a conservative party of interest in Europe to secure its own throne, will place forth an offer to the victorious NGF that it will not intervene in any attempt to form a united German state, and in return, the Germans will not violate its rule over the important Alsace-Lorraine. This could only go well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00076;Bourbon offer of neutrality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00076;The Bourbon realm to the west has offered to willingly relinquish its stake in Germany for merely a guarantee of remaining neutral on the province of Alsace-Lorraine.

EVTNAME00086;The Declaration of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00086;In the aftermath of the Bourbon Empire's declaration, the geopolitical situation in Europe has rapidly altered its course in response. Fears of a Franco-Spanish domineering force across the European continent has spurred on a fearful response unseen since the days of Napoleon Bonaparte himself. The brazen violation of the treaty of Utrecht has not gone unnoticed, and the beginnings of an international coalition have come into being. A declaration has been issued from the powers, meeting in Prague, declaring the state of the Bourbon Empire to be an illegitimate construct of a state and an existential threat to peace in Europe. It is expected that within a year, the empires of Europe will make their move. Whether we weather the storm or not will determine if the Bourbon Empire has a future in the world to begin with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00086;We will weather the storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00087;The Second War of Spanish Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00087;The powers of Europe have now made their move, in hopes of putting an end to the personal union between Spain and France. With little room for error and little chance of leniency should the French nation fail to assert itself for a third time in recent memory, the result of this war will determine the fate of both realms, perhaps for the rest of the century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00087;The storm has arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00088;The Coalition of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00088;As per the Declaration of Prague we are an interested party to the dismantling of the Bourbon Empire. It is in our best interest to take part in this war, though we can always choose to back out if it is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00088;We will go to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00088;We will back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00089;The Peace of Lubeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00089;Despite our best efforts, the realm of the Bourbon Empire has been beaten and broken by the vast efforts of the coalition levied against it. In the aftermath of the war, the Empire has been forced to split into its contituent parts, neither of which permitted to house the House de Bourbon any longer, but rather emplaced under responsible governments set up by the victors to ensure this situation never occurs again. The Empire is broken, and will likely never rise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00089;We have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00116;Integrating Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00116;Ever since the Polish Partition, the Poles have long languished under foreign rule, including our own. However, whilst the Prussians and Russians have oppressed Poles to a great degree, the Austrian Empire has given to them a relatively light burden, compared to the struggles they face elsewhere. With the conquest of Poland complete, the kingdom can be integrated into the empire wholesale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00116;Dissolve Galicia, Integrate Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00117;The Greek Revolution - Total Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00117;The unthinkable has happened. Despite our best efforts, the Greek revolution has achieved even its most ludicrous goals, beating us back time and time again across the Balkan provinces and throwing our empire into utter chaos. With the leadership of the empire crumbling outright, we have been forced to come to terms with the upstarts, ceding the whole of our Greek balkan provinces and the Anatolian coastline to the upstart rebels, and ceding the rest of our disconnected holdings either to independent states or to the very same Greeks. Our empire has reached a low unseen ever before, and this humiliation will not be soon forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00117;We have been ruined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00118;The Basileia tos Rhomaion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00118;With the success of the revolution being far more than nigh any could have predicted, the beginnings of what can only be the finest hour in Rhomaion history are at hand. While the government may not yet be formed, only a provisional government under various bickering revolutionary leaders present, and the constitution is as of yet a greatly new concept, the ecstatic Greek citizens have already taken to calling the newly independent state the 'Basileia tos Rhomaion,' the new Roman Empire. With the city of Constantinople in Greek hands, and the Aegaean sea controlled on both sides by the meteorically rising state, there is little reason to not accept this title as it stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00118;Long live the true Romans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00119;An empire...of rot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00119;While the Greek people may yet call this the true Basileia tos Rhomaion, the Roman Empire, the state inherited by the revolution is anything but the glorious empire it claims pretense to. Despite the victory of the revolution, state control over the vast territory of land inherited from the Ottoman sultanate is loose at best, roaming bands of Turkish and Albanian irregulars still roaming the countryside and raiding Greek settlements, the bureaucracy is greatly strained, the political leadership of the nation is dominated by infighting, and a great deal of officials have questionable loyalties at best to the security of the Rhomaion state. It may yet be an empire, but it has a long way to go to being a true successor to the thrones of old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00119;Oh the misery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00129;The Provisional Rhomaion Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00129;The Rhomaion state is currently in the midst of a tenuous provisional government, headed by Andreas Zaimis, a conservative appointed as the head of the government as an interrim leader until the revolution could be successful. With the revolution successful, and international mediation having failed, the crisis of power can be delayed no longer. There are many leaders, with many differing interests for what the Greek state should be. There is Theodoros Kolokotronis, the head of the Russian faction of government, and a firm advocate for a strong Rhomaion monarchy backed by the Tsar, there is Alexandros Mavrokordatos, the former writer of the Hellene constitution, but criticized for structuring it around his own power and influence, Yannis Makriyannis, a moderate liberal and firm advocate of constitutionalism, Petrobey Mavromachalis, a natural local leader whose family has kept the Ottomans back for a long time, and Nikitaras, known as the Turk Eater for his fervent and principled war effort against the Ottoman Sultan. Whomever is chosen as the successor by Zaimis will determine the fate of the Rhomaion state for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTD00129;Nikitaras, the Turk Eater;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE00129;Mavromichalis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00121;The Agenda of Kolokotronis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00121;Kolokotronis has emerged from the initial bout of succession as the emergent power in domestic Rhomaion affairs. A firm and devout supporter of the Russian faction of politics, the Rhomaion state is expected to lean heavily into the Russian Tsardom's sphere of influence under his guidance. Furthermore, it is highly likely that he will seek to instate a Russian prince as monarch of the empire. It is doubtless that in time the English and French factions of politics will come to find great disagreement in the leadership of the realm, but that matters little.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00121;Got it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00122;A Russian Monarch?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00122;It is no secret that with Kolokotronis in charge, the Russian faction of Rhomaion politics has sway in the highest branches of government, and the power to enact great change in this crucial time for development in the state. As such, it was inevitable that they use their majority to appoint a Russian prince, the Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, as king of the Rhomaion state, forming it from a mere republic into a true kingdom, supported by its natural and ancient ally in Russia to the north. While this will surely displease many constitutionalists and liberals, these sentiments will undoubtedly fall to the wayside in the face of a true monarch's benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00122;Long live the Roman Tsar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00123;The Opposition of Mavrokordatos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00123;Mavrokordatos, the writer who put to pen the first Greek constitution, has increasingly come to blows with the current Rhomaion state government from his power base in the western reaches of the country. Having built the bureaucracy of the state around himself, it has proven difficult to dislodge him from his support base in the west without bringing about a second civil war in the country. Should we choose to leave him be, he will continue to prove a nuisance to Rhomaion state affairs for quite some time, but should we take this to a military conclusion, it is inevitable that the result be a renewal of armed hostilities in the western reaches of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00123;Let him be, he does little harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00123;Put this insurrectionist in his place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00124;Nicholas the Wastrel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00124;Nicholas, the great king of the Rhomaion state, has unfortunately begun to prove himself as less than great in practice as a monarch. While his ascention has all but guaranteed continued friendship with the Russian Tsardom, it has quickly become apparent that Nicholas was never properly trained to rule this newly independent state through these turbulent opening years. A chronic wastrel, he has taken to rampant spending and partying instead of ruling the empire he was handed, and instead of using his own estate, he has also taken to using up state funds to do so. To add further insult to injury, he has proven himself greatly interested in military affairs, forcing military reorganization to make himself the head of the Rhomaion armed forces, and already the former military leadership of the revolution has found his leadership distinctly lacking, and unfortunately too stubborn to placate. His continued rule may well prove to be disastrous for the people of the Rhomaion state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00124;Please, God, have mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00125;The Slavic Mandate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00125;Despite the great many failings of the Russian monarch ruling over the Rhomaion state, one great boon has been brought to light in recent times. With a Russian orthodox monarch at the helm of the kingdom, the character of the nation has been made such that integration of slavic peoples in the realm will be far smoother and easier than it would otherwise be, as fears of Rhomaion domination of their communities would be greatly unfounded when the state is itself run by a Slavophile royal house. This has proven to dissuade independence movements and even encourage integration amongst the Slavic peoples of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00125;Perhaps there is a light in the tunnel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00126;Nicholas the Bastard;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00126;Yet more controversy has arisen regarding the king of the Rhomaion state, as it has come to light that the king has long been engaged in an affair with a mistress, and has remained indiscreet with this affair, leading to a public breakup with his wife, Alexanda Petrovina of Oldenburg, and the discovery of multiple bastard sires in this affair. His hopes had been to ultimately divorce his own wife in favor of this mistress, but these hopes have been dashed in light of the affair being discovered and brought to the public, and the refusal of his wife to grant the divorce he seeks in order to remarry the mistress he sought. This has brought great humiliation to the state and to foreign dignitaries representing the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00126;The wastrel is a shame to us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00127;Nicholas the Mad;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00127;In recent days, the behavior of the king has grown increasingly erratic, particularly following the death of his mistress, Catherine Chislova. His hopes to marry her have in recent months been dashed, as his wife, who long refused a divorce that would render this affair a potentially legal marriage, has now proven herself to outlive this very same mistress. Perhaps from grief, perhaps from a long hidden madness kept hidden from public, or perhaps from the oral cancer he suffers now having spread to his brain, the king has become a mad ruler, attacking the courtiers in his palace like a wild beast, spending far more lavishly than ever before, and growing ever more erratic on the daily. His rule has now become more disastrous than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00127;Save us from his madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00128;The Internment of Nicholas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00128;As the madness of Nicholas has grown ever more apparent to the governing bodies of state, so too has the need to remove him from office become a necessity for the survival of the state. With his son, the presumptive heir in Nicholas the Younger, heading the movement to depose him, it would seem his rule has come to an inglorious end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00128;The madness has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00200;The Restoration of Etrutia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00200;The Kingdom of Etruria was a short-lived kingdom in the Italian peninsula, created by Napoleon I as a form of compensation to the Spanish line of Bourbon-Parma, and ultimately dissolved in 1815. With our success in overturning this aspect of the congress of Vienna, the kingdom can be restored, securing further Bourbon gains in the Italian peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00201;The Treaty of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00201;The belligerent Sardinian kingdom has been defeated on the battlefield definitively, putting an end to their expansionist ambitions in the Italian peninsula. To ensure the continued security of both Austria and France, the state is to be effectively dismantled, its kindom split in twain, French majority regions handed back to the kingdom of France, and Genoa released once more as an independent republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00201;This will undoubtedly bring stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00204;The Carlist War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00204;The Liberals in Spain have defied our prior enforcement of the absolutist rule of the Bourbon line and brought about a pragmatic sanction to cement their own rule over our neighbor, denying Carlos the right to his rule. Catalans and Basque have rallied behind him to dispute this unlawful succession, and while we may stand by and do nothing, many in our administration advocate immediate intervention to secure a long term ally...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00204;How many times do we need to teach you this lesson, old man?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00204;We have enough problems already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00205;French Intervention victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00205;The unlawful Christinos have been deposed and French forces once again march triumphantly throughout Spain, bearing the banner of the French crown alongside the Burgundian Cross of Spain. Now, the question remains of how to administer our ally, whether to trust them to rule alone or to take more direct responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00205;The crown is restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00205;Keep Spain under surveillance. §RGain 15 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC00205;Keep Spain controlled, and seize Cuba. §RGain 20 infamy§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00206;French Intervention defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00206;We have successfully repulsed even the French from our lands, preventing another repeat of the Bourbon tyranny within our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00206;Viva La Espana!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00208;Distributism in Cuba;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00208;Distributist measures taken in the Spanish mainland have thus far proven quite successful, prompting some in the more abolitionist camp of government to propose expanding the program well beyond the shores of Spain proper, and to extend it to the colonial holdings of Cuba and Puerto Rico as well. To do so would cost a great investment from the Spanish coffers, but could prove invaluable to recovering the island possessions' respective economies in the aftermath of abolition by handing landed estates to freed slaves and to those peninsulares whom have yet to benefit on the mainland. However, this will doubtlessly earn further ire from former slaveholders on the islands, and may yet prove another challenge for Spanish authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00208;What a brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00208;Who cares about the islands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
