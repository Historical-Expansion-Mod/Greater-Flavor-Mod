EVTNAME377903;Collapse of French Rule in Algeria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC377903;With the loss of any direct connection to our holdings in the interior of Algeria, our rule in the region has collapsed.

Unless the North African coast can be recovered by our forces, we are unlikely to re-establish a foothold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
