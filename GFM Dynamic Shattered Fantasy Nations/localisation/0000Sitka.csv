bon_compagni_law_desc;The Bon-Compagni Law, named after the Minister of Education Carlo Boncompagni of Mombello, establishes national boarding schools, which constitute the backbone of the new Piedmontese school system. The law provides for governmental control of schools of all levels, both state and free, through the Superior Council of Education, which is responsible for the organization of studies, teaching plans, the approval of course programs and books and treaties adopted.

OHNOWEWANTMORESHOEPAY;The Panic of 1857 has resulted in the temporary loss of jobs for many shoemakers. Workers are also angry at the increasing mechanization of the shoemaking process. Since companies began hiring again, the cost of shoes has gone up and wages have declined significantly. Hours are long (16 hours of work per day) and wages are low. Men are earning only 3 dollars a week and women just 1 dollar. In early 1860, the Mechanics Association formed and demanded higher wages. The company owners refused to meet with committees of the association and workers have decided to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DAGUERROTYPELOC;Invented by Louis Daguerre and introduced worldwide in 1839, the daguerreotype is the first publically available photographic recording method. To make the image, a daguerreotypist polished a sheet of silver-plated copper to a mirror finish, treated it with fumes that made its surface light sensitive, exposed it in a camera for as long as was judged to be necessary, which could be a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or longer with less intense lighting, made the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor, removed its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment, rinsed and dried it, and then sealed the easily marred result behind glass in a protective enclosure. The image is on a mirror-like silver surface and will appear either positive or negative, depending on the viewing angle, lighting and reflectiveness and brightness of the background reflected in the metal. The darkest areas of the image are simply bare silver, lighter areas have a fine texture. The surface is very delicate, and even the lightest wiping can permanently scuff it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

panic_of_eighteenthirtyseven_desc;The Panic of 1837 is a financial crisis in the United States that has touched off a major depression, which will last until the mid-1840s. Profits, prices, and wages went down; unemployment are going up; and pessimism abounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANICOFEIGHTEENTHIRTYSEVENLOC;The panic had both domestic and foreign origins. Speculative lending practices in the West, a sharp decline in cotton prices, a collapsing land bubble, international specie flows, and restrictive lending policies in Britain were all factors. The lack of a central bank to regulate fiscal matters, which President Jackson had ensured by not extending the charter of the Second Bank of the United States, was also key. This ailing economy of early 1837 led investors to panic, a bank run ensued, giving the crisis its name. The run came to a head on May 10, 1837, when banks in New York City ran out of gold and silver. A significant economic collapse followed. Despite a brief recovery in 1838, the recession persisted for about seven years. Nearly half of all banks failed, businesses closed, prices declined, and there was mass unemployment. From 1837 to 1844 deflation in wages and prices was widespread. The lack of deposit insurance deepened the Panic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HUNZALOC;When Mortimer Durand, Secretary for State of India was appointed administrator of the Gilgit Agency, he opened up the region by building roads, telegraph and mail systems. He intended to improve the road from Kashmir through Hunza and Nagar and up to the frontier with Russia. The Mirs of Nagar and Hunza saw this as a threat to their natural advantage of remoteness. In 1890, Durand reinforced Chalt Fort that was near the border due to the rumor that Nagar and Hunza fighters were about to attack it, building up the road up to the fort. In May 1891, Nagar and Hunza sent a warning to Durand not to continue work on the road to the fort and to vacate the fort on the Gilgit side of the border, else they would regard it as an act of war. Durand reinforced the fort and accelerated the road construction to it, causing Nagar and Hunza to break relations. Britain regarded this as a breach of their 1889 agreement with Hunza, and after an ultimatum was issued and ignored they initiated the Hunza-Nagar Campaign of $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GILDEDLOC;The Gilded Age is an era occurring during the late 19th century, from the 1870s to about 1900. It is a time of rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern and Western United States. As American wages soar above those in Europe, especially for skilled workers, we are is seeing an influx of millions of immigrants. The rapid expansion of industrialization is leading to a real wage growth of 60% between 1860 and 1890 and spreading across the growing labor force. The average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) will rise 48% between 1880 and 1890. Conversely, the Gilded Age is also an era of abject poverty and inequality, as millions of immigrants pour into the United States, and the high concentration of wealth becomes more visible and contentious. Politically, the gilded age is introducing more and more influence of business, with tycoons such as John D. Rockefeller, Andrew W. Mellon, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan, Meyer Guggenheim and Cornelius Vanderbilt, so-called 'robber barons' lobbying congress to follow their will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EMUWARLOC;The Emu War, also known as the Great Emu War, was a nuisance wildlife management military operation undertaken in Australia over the later part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus said to be running amok in the Campion district of Western Australia. The unsuccessful attempts to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with Lewis gunsleading the media to adopt the name 'Emu War' when referring to the incident. While a number of the birds were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FWTHREEDEATHLOC;Born in 1770 and crowned King of Prussia and Margrave of Brandenburg in 1797, Frederick William III died of a fever today at the age of 69. His steady and confident rule saw Prussia through the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire.

Under his leadership, Prussia progressed from an absolutist, agrarian caste society to an enlightened and industrial nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Another stroke in 1859 paralyzed his left side, and a further one permanently robbed him of consciousness in Novemeber of 1860. His last stroke ended the suffering. His legacy includes his handling of the revolutions of 1848 and the many castles and monuments he had constructed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WILONEDEATHLOC;Born in 1797 and crowned King of Prussia in 1860 having held the regency for the incapacitated Frederick William IV since 1858, Wilhelm I left us today at the age of 90 after a short period of illness. His last words were 'Ich habe keine Zeit müde zu sein.' or 'I have no time to be tired.'. A man of great vigor and tenacity even in his high age, he survived 4 assassination attempts, one only because of the protection of his Pickelhaube. Deeply loved by the people for his dignity, friendliness and compassion, he will have the most memorials of any German monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FTHREEDEATHLOC;Born in 1831 and crowned King of Prussia in 1888, Frederick II only wore the crown for 99 days. A strong smoker, he had been suffering from hoarseness since 1887, when in May a carcinoma in his throat was identified. He initially refused being operated on and instead went to a mountain resort in Italy, hoping the climate would improve his condition. Meanwhile his doctors were hiding the fact that the carcinoma was increasingly growing. Shortly before William I's death, he could barely breathe, leading to a tracheotomy which robbed him of his voice. His 3-month reign was severely limited, his plans for limiting monarchical power and strengthening the constitution never coming to fruition. His last diary entry was: 'What's happening to me? I must get well again, I have so much to do!'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALFONSODEATH;Alfonso XII, known as 'El Pacificador' or 'The Peacemaker' has died at the young age of 28 after a brutal case of dysentery combined with tuberculosis. He ascended to the throne after the failure of the republic put in place by the Glorious Revolution, restoring the Spanish Bourbon dynasty of his mother who remained in exile in Paris. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party. During his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were improved. His unborn son will is the heir to the throne, but he will only come of age in 1902. Maria Christina of Austria will act as Queen regent until her son is ready for the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These scandalous remarks have now been published, greatly diminishing our foreign relations. Especially the British were enraged by the quote: 'You English are mad, mad, mad as March hares.

NAPOLEONEXPLAINED;As France, you begin as a constitutional monarchy under King Louis Philippe. If you get 3 militancy in the revolutions of 1848 and don't have the (weighted) universal voting reform, you'll get an event for the French Revolution installing the Second Republic. You will then need to keep the conservative ruling party in power until 1851. There are two ways to do this: either through manually holding elections or via an event that lets you choose between Napoleon III and Cavaignac for president--you must obviously choose Napoleon III. Following this step, you will get an event in 1851 for Napoleon III's coup. This sets you to an absolute empire and gives you a variety of exclusive expansion paths, such as purchasing Luxembourg, claiming Catalonia, launching a second French intervention in Mexico, and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CHRISTIANDEATH;After ruling for 8 years, King Christian VIII has died today at age 61. His demise was caused by blood poisoning inflicted accidentally by medicinal bloodletting. Before his passing, he was long faced with a dilemma: His son, Frederick VII, was without heirs and had two divorces behind him, bringing danger to the family line, but due to differing succession laws, passing the monarchy to his niece Louise von Hessen would have split the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein from the Danish crown. Christian could not fulfill his last ambition, namely a new united constitution for both Denmark and the duchies that would guarantee safe inheritance to Louise, and so the crown has passed to Frederick. Amid the chaos of 1848 erupting in Europe however, the demand for a new constitution continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARCHREVLOC;With the insecurity of the government following the late King Christian's passing, much confusion has spread among the populace. Fearing centralization efforts by the government, representatives from Schleswig and Holstein have gathered in Rendsburg to discuss the government's alleged plans regarding a new constitution. A messenger informing the residents of Copenhagen of the gathering, but the news quickly spun out of control, making people think a rebellion had begun in the duchies. Furious citizens marched to the royal palace to demand a new constitution to assert dominance over the supposed revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Years of hard work, thousands of tons of cement, hundreds of deaths and many more injuries have been the price, but the reward is much greater. Connecting Lake Onega to the White Sea enables shipping to connect over Lake Ladoga to the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea, enabling ships to sail straight to the White Sea instead of having to go North of Norway. The region will surely experience an economic upturn with the sudden increase in trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hecker himself went into exile in the United States, while other leaders fled to Switzerland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AVAEARTHQUAKE;This morning, Mandalay was struck by a devastating earthquake. So strong was the shaking of the ground that it could be felt in both Rangoon and Bhamo, incredibly even temporarily reversing the flow of the Irrawady River to go upstream and cause flooding.

HAIYUANQUAKE;An immense earthquake has struck the area around the epicenter in Haiyuan seeing the largest recorded death toll out of any earthquake in history. Entire villages were buried in landslides, and nearly all the houses collapsed in a large radius around Haiyuan.

In total, around 250.000 people died in the tragedy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KRALINCIDENT;Following our revolt against Austria, Slovaks have been fearing magyarization. Amid rising tensions, a pair of Slovaks, Janko Král and Jan Rotarides, made demands for the liquidation of serfdom and recognition of the Slovak language in schools and the government. They intensified their intentions by rousing serfs in Hont County into rebellion against their landlords, as well encouraging the burning of local urbariums. These actions soon landed the pair in jail, where they would be tortured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SLOVAKMANIFESTO;A manifesto has been issued by Slovak nationalists, dubbed 'Demands of the Slovak Nation'. It was made up of fourteen points, including but not limited to equality and fraternal coexistence of all people in Hungary, adoption of the Slovak language as an official language in government offices and schools in Slovak areas, establishment of a Slovak national guard, introduction of full voting rights for adult males, official recognition of Slovak symbols, abolition of laws limiting the freedoms of the press, of assembly and of association, reformation of land ownership by restoring the land that had been seized from the peasants by the Hungarian aristocracy and transformation of Hungary into a decentralized state consisting of equal nations each with its own parliament and equal representation in the Diet of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
POTATOANGER;The Potato Decrees have begun taking effect in the Volga-Ural area, however the inhabitants are very paranoid and fearful of this new crop.

kisilev_reforms_desc;Leader of the 5th department of His Imperial Majesty's Chancellery, Pavel Dmitrievich Kiselev has proposed a number of reforms aimed at the eventual abolition of serfdom and improvement of the Russian administration. These include creating chambers of state property with a state property district each, split into departments of forestry and general economic departments with district chiefs at the head of both. Depending on the local population, these districts could cover one or more counties, with subdivisions into volosts with a local government elected for three years and parishes within the volosts which in turn would consist of villages, each with its own local gathering that would elect a village elder for three years, assign policemen and decide on local sentences for misdemeanors. Another proposal is giving landowners the right to free their serfs at their will, concluding an agreement with them on the provision of land allotments to them in hereditary possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MAYASSEMBLY;Following the Hungarian war of independence against Austria, Serbians have grown increasingly uneasy about Magyar rule. Political leaders of the Serbs have decided to hold an assembly demanding a separate Serb voivodeship within the areas of Syrmia, Baranja, Backa, the Becej District, Banat and the Kikinda District. Secondary demands include sending a delegation to the slavic congress in Prague and recognizing Romanian ethnic sovereignty. If we do not recognize the voivodeship of Vojvodina, there will be a revolt threatening our war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

POORBIRD;The Great Auk, a species of bird long dwindling in population long confined to a small island off the coast of Iceland, has gone extinct. The Great Auks numbered no more than fifty individuals on their last habitat on the island of Eldey where they were slowly killed due to museums desiring their skins for preservation and display. The last pair, found incubating an egg, was killed there on June 1844, on request from a merchant who wanted specimens, with locals Jón Brandsson and Sigurður Ísleifsson strangling the adults and Ketill Ketilsson smashing the egg with his boot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORSINIATTACK;Disgruntled Italian nationalist Felice Orsini attempted to assassinate Emperor Napoleon III last night. He believed that by killing him, he would cause a social revolution in France that would spread to Italy and lead to the unification of the Italian peninsula. At 8:30 PM, as Napoléon and his wife Eugénie were taking a carriage to the opera, Orsini struck with his accomplices. Three bombs were tossed next to the royal carriage, however its special armoring saved the royal couples' lives. Pedestrians were not so lucky, for 12 died that same night and 156 more were injured. Orsini and his co-conspirators were arrested on the spot, tried and sentenced to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUSENSTOLP;A series of riots has taken place in Stockholm, caused by the Swedish Court of Appeals' decision to sentence the publicist Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe to three years' imprisonment for lèse-majesté for insulting King Karl XIV Johan. The action of the king that Crusenstolpe criticized was having promoted a noble two military ranks at once instead of the usual single rank who, in addition, did not prove himself deserving of a promotion. This perceived unjust punishment of the fair criticism given by Crusenstolpe led to several riotous crowds gathering in Stockholm to demand his release and, in one case, even attempt to storm his prison. In the end, 2 people died and 5 were seriously injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASTORPLACE;Tensions in New York have boiled over in a nativist riot against British actor William Charles Macready as his feud with the American actor Edwin Forrest came to a head. The two had long been friends, both doing tours of each others countries, however in recent years they have developed a rivalry that galvanized the lower, anti-British class against the upper, pro-British class in New York. Macready's performance at Astor Place Theater was interrupted by a crowd breaking down the doors. As Macready escaped through the back exit, cops began beating the rioters with their batons to get a hold on the situation. This had the opposite effect: More and more people joined the mob and drove back the police, leading to state troopers having to be deployed to restore order. 25 rioters died and over 120 were injured, and Astor Place Theater will forever be known as "DisAstor Place".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOODYSUNDAY;This Sunday, some 10,000 people gathered in Trafalgar Square, London, to protest against unemployment and coercion in Ireland. 2,000 police and 400 soldiers were deployed to forcibly disperse the crowd with batons, arresting 400 and injuring 75. Many protestors were armed with iron bars, knives, pokers and gas pipes to defend their protest, escalating the ensuing conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GAVAZZIRIOT;Riots have occurred in Quebec City and Montreal by mobs which attacked halls in which ex-Catholic monk Alessandro Gavazzi was lecturing. The principal participants were Irish Catholics who were angered by Gavazzi's sentiments. Gavazzi attributed the failure of the Italian national movement of 1848-49 to the defection of Pope Pius IX from the cause, and therefore rejected Catholicism. In both cases, strong bodies of police had been stationed nearby in anticipation of disturbances and shot into the crowds indiscriminately, dispersing them with ease. 5 people died and many more were injured, while Gavazzi arrived back in Italy safe and sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MONTREALPARLIAMENTBURN;Last night, following a series of riots by conservatives in Canada in response to the Rebellion Losses Bill, an angry mob of about 1,500 gathered in Montreal and burned down the parliament buildings.

Soon after, police began rounding up people under suspicion of having participated in the torching while the parliament temporarily moved into a church to be safe in its sanctity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANSTRIKEONE;Last week, about 200,000 workers participated in a strike to pressure the government into introducing universal voting rights inspired by the strike of 1886.

Now it is in our hands: Will we introduce universal suffrage or will we stick to the tried and true system we have used so far?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BELGIANSTRIKETWO;A small gathering organized by anarchists in Liège met with unexpected support, partly as a result of the ongoing economic downturn and harsh winter. Between 800-900 workers, many from the city's metal works, attended the initial demonstration. Rather than abating, the strike spread like a wildfire through the industrial areas where bloody clashes with police ensued. Several dozen people gave their lives to the cause that, in the end, yielded no results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vuk_karadzic_reform_title;Vuk Karadic's language reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vuk_karadzic_reform_desc;Vuk Stefanovic Karadic has reformed the Serbian literary language and standardized the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet by following strict phonemic principles on the Johann Christoph Adelung model and Jan Hus Czech alphabet. Karadic's reforms of the Serbian literary language modernized it and distanced it from Serbian and Russian Church Slavonic and brought it closer to common folk speech. However, he has a eastern Bosnian accent which many in northern Serbia and Vojvodina have difficulty adapting to. Officially recognizing it will help us more efficiently run our schools, however it will also require a short period of adaptation to the dialect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOODYMONDAY;Religious tensions against Catholic immigrants have spiked in Louisville, Kentucky, where on election day, mobs of Irish and German immigrants clashed with crowds of shotgun-armed nativist Kentuckians. Twenty-two people died and five were arrested. Several city blocks were burnt to the ground by the fire formed in the ensuing chaos. The mayor, despite himself being a nativist, called to end the fighting and form a bucket line to quell the flames, thereby saving the church and many other homes within Louisville.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mannheim_water_tower_desc;Mannheim has been growing exponentially in recent years, requiring an increased supply of water. City planners have suggested taking an undeveloped area and placing a large water tower to be designed in an architectural competition in the middle, making the surroundings into a park and rounding them off with an ornate details and statues on the tower. This will create a pleasant place to relax for generations to come while the city expands around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATHRIOT;A riot has taken place in Bath, Maine, instigated by a travelling street-preacher named John S. Orr. He calls himself 'The Angel Gabriel', and dresses in white robes, carrying a trumpet. Orr delivered an anti-Catholic sermon on a commercial street, the crowd of spectators eventually swelling to over a thousand and blocking carriage traffic. After the sermon, the angry crowd burnt down the Catholic church and patrolled the streets all night to intimidate the Irish immigrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MONTPELEEERUPTS;It began 15 days ago, when the inhabitants of Saint-Pierre, the largest city of Martinique, awoke to a huge column of steam arising from Mont Pelée, the volcano long thought to be extinct that looms above the city. Over the next few days, eruptions increased in intensity. As lightning laced the eruption clouds and trade winds dumped ash on villages to the West, many fled to the perceived safety of Saint-Pierre. Today, at 8:00 AM  A ground-hugging cloud of incandescent lava particles suspended by searing gases moved at hurricane speed down the Southwest flank of the volcano, reaching the city at 8:02 AM. Escape was virtually impossible. Almost everyone withinabout 28,000 peopledied, burned or buried by falling masonry. The hot ash ignited a firestorm, fueled by smashed buildings and countless casks of rum. Only two people survived within the city, along with a few tens of people caught within the margins of the cloud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TARAWERAERUPTION;Shortly after midnight this morning, a series of more than 30 increasingly strong earthquakes was felt in the Rotorua area and an unusual sheet lightning display was observed from the direction of Tarawera. At around 2:00 AM, a larger earthquake was felt and followed by the sound of an explosion. By 2:30 AM, Mount Tarawera's three peaks erupted, blasting three distinct columns of smoke and ash thousands of meters into the sky. By 3:30 AM, the eruption reached its most destructive phase when a pyroclastic surge destroyed several villages within a 6-kilometer radius, and obliterated the Pink and White Terraces, a natural terraced hotspring of which there are less than a dozen worldwide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KALATCOLLAPSE;Shah Nawaz Khan, a direct descendant of Mahabat Khan who had been dethroned by the Durranis, was installed at only 14 years of age by the Brits as Khan of Kalat after they had invaded and killed Mir Mehrab Khan Baloch II to secure the route through Kalat to Kandahar in the Anglo-Afghan War. Nawaz Khan was deposed by Mir Nasir Khan II, throwing off the British yoke but throwing the country into turmoil. The already autonomous vassal states of Las Bela, Kohistan and Makran have taken advantage of the situation to become fully independent, while Kharan remains nominally aligned to the Khan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME91179;The Normanton Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91179;A British vessel called the Normanton was wrecked off the cape of Kashinozaki, running aground and forcing its crewmen and passengers to evacuate. The crew all survived and escaped on lifeboats. The 25 Japanese passengers aboard, however, all perished, supposedly without any chance to secure lifeboats for themselves. The case is currently tried in a court for British subjects in Japan. The locals, meanwhile, are highly skeptical of the case's facts: they do not easily believe that the Japanese passengers had no means of surviving, and they speculate the Normanton's crew simply refused to give the passengers lifeboats. The Normanton's crew was all British, save for 12 Indians and Chinese. It is easily assumed that the British crewmen sacrificed the passengers' lives simply because they were Japanese. But because the case is not being adjudicated by our own court, it will be difficult to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The crater alone was 90m by 125m wide and 19m deep. Even in Heidelberg 30km away, traffic was stopped by the mass of broken glass on the streets, a tram was derailed, and some roofs were destroyed. The blast could be heard as far as Munich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SUNMIRACLE;A prophecy by three shepherd children, Lúcia Santos and Francisco and Jacinta Marto lead a large number of pilgrims to head for the town of Fátima. The prophecy foretold that on the 3rd October 1917, the the Virgin Mary would appear and perform miracles. An estimated crowd of between 30.000-100.000 eyewitnesses watched in awe as the sun  appeared to 'dance' or zig-zag in the sky, careen towards the Earth, or emit multicolored light and radiant colors. According to these reports, the event lasted approximately ten minutes. While some deem this to be a simple occurance of mass hysteria caused by staring intently into the sun, many of the faithful regard it as a holy event, declaring Fatíma a holy city for being the only place to witness the occurances. The catholic church itself has not given any clear support or doubt to the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

His demands include autonomy for Albania within the Empire, stopping the replacement of Albanian local government officials with Turkish ones brought from Anatolia, who neither know Albania's language nor its customs and the exemption of Albanians from conscription to the Ottoman Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Angered by the execution of Ali Pasha Rizvanbegovic, the vizier of the Herzegovina Eyalet who was pre-emptively removed due to the discovery that he had been conspiring against rule from $CAPITAL$, the Herzegovinians were already high on anti-Ottoman sentiment when Omar Pasha, the field marshal in charge of pacifying Bosnia demanded that they disarm, causing them to enter open revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MCDREVOLT;The constant lawless behavior of the local inhabitants of the countryside, closely linked to the phenomenon of banditry, has long undermined any sense of lawfulness in the Ottoman provinces of the Greek peninsula. With our loss of Yanya and involvement in far-away wars, the Greeks of Macedonia have taken up arms with support from the kingdom of Greece. Led by revolutionaries with experience from the Greek Revolution of 1821 like Dimitrios Karatasos, chieftains from Mount Olympos have seized the Vale of Tempe, Pieria and the surroundings of Gerebena. Another detachment led by Tsamis Karatasos has landed in Sithonia. Both rebel forces pose a threat to the key city of Selanik and must be crushed lest they capture more territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With destabilizing developments such as Leonidas Voulgaris' landing on Ormylia in Chalkidiki, the operations of the secretive nationalist organization known as "Kazino" in Manastir and the suppression of revolutionary cells in Thessaly and Epirus, unruly Greek villagers have taken the opportunity to begin a revolt. It is centered on Western Macedonia and Mariovo, far removed from the Kingdom of Greece and the sea. Thus the rebels should be easy to crush as they have no access to outside support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PONYEXPRESS;Operated by the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company, the Pony Express is of great financial importance to the U.S. It reduces the time for messages to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to about 10 days. It has become the West's most direct means of east-west communication, and is vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the United States. It relies on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses going from station to station with around 10 miles inbetween each. Thus the riders can gallop nonstop by exchanging a tired horse for fresh one at every station. The route, following the Oregon and California trails to Fort Bridger, taking the Hastings Cutoff to Salt Lake City and the Central Nevada Route to Carson City over the Sierra Nevada to Sacramento is around 1.900 miles long and was traversed in a record 7 days when bringing the news of Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MIANIBATTLE;General James Napier, formerly the governor of the Ionian island of Kefalonia, has long been on the search for glory. Becoming general of the honorable East India Comany's Bombay Army was just the chance he needed. Without consulting London, he marched into Sindh to demand diplomatic concessions from Mir Nasir Khan Talpur. He was quite surprised when the Mir begrudgingly accepted these as he had planned to use his refusal as pretext for an invasion. After sullenly marching out of Sindh, he had a change of heart and crossed the border once more to bring Sindh into the fold of the British Empire, winning the first engagement with the Sindhi conscripts with ease. Now that word of this has reached us, shall we order Napier to stand down or give approval to him finishing his little war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A large group of prisoners got in touch with Siberian regionalists to plan a major uprising but were caught by the police before they could do anything dangerous. However, one roadcrew of Poles revolted against their captors and made for the Mongolian border, liberating other small groups of prisoners and raiding local institutions such as post offices. Nearby cossack units quickly caught up with them and engaged in battle. Of the 700-odd escapees, only 400 survived to be recaptured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SVANETISTRONK;Following the integration of Svaneti, the local administration has recently begun surveying the Svan lands and counting their inhabitants to instate new taxes and military duties. 2000 angry locals have gathered at the so-called 'Convention of Khevi' in the village of Lalkhori, where they have sworn an oath in the church of Kvirike to defend themselves with force if the government does proceeds with its measures. Avoiding a confrontation is as simple as relinquishing the taxes and military duties, but other inhabitants of the region would certainly be encouraged to make similar demands upon seeing the Svans have success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LINDORCHOCOLATE;Starting with humble beginnings in 1836 in a small confectionary shop in the old town of Zürich, David Sprüngli-Schwarz and his son Rudolf Sprüngli-Amman have now moved to the Paradeplatz where they have established a small factory to solidify chocolate more efficiently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Claim_CUB_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! For too long has Cuba been under the colonial jackboot. Already in 1823, the secret organization of the Suns and Rays of Bolívar plotted to overthrow the Spanish colonial government and join the island of Cuba to Gran Colombia. Unfortunately, the Spanish discovered the plan and arrested the conspirators. With our present military might, we can finally free Cuba and integrate it into the lands of Gran Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Claim_DR_desc;§RGain 3 infamy§! The Dominican Republic was once a sister republic of Gran Colombia, planning to join the union. However, when it was but less than a year old, Haiti occupied it and foiled all attempts of its integration. Now that Gran Colombia is once again strong and capable, we can use our might to reverse this turn of fate and bring the Republic of Spanish Haiti back to its rightful position as a part of Bolívar's dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

beagle_voyage_desc;The HMS Beagle's first survey voyage under depressed captain Pringle Stokes was ill-fated as the morose captain soon committed suicide. Graduate Charles Darwin has made a name for himself in geology and fossil collection. Captain Robert FitzRoy suggests we launch a second expedition with Darwin on board to both survey the Pacific and southern oceans and make scientific observations on those remote regions of the Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DARWINWRITESABOOK;Charles Darwin has returned from his voyage on the HMS Beagle and published his observations in a journal titled 'The Voyage of the Beagle'. His keen powers of observation and new theories on evolution through common descent and natural selection have made the book popular and brought him much fame and respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LONDONBRIDGEEXPLOSION;Yesterday, at 5:45PM during rush hour, an explosion was seen below the London Bridge, destroying hundreds of nearby windows but causing little damage to the bridge. 2 Irish-Americans had begun attaching a bomb to a pier as a part of the Fenian Dynamite Campaign when it went off prematurely and annihilated the bombers and their boat. Thankfully they were the only casualties. At first it was assumed that they had fled as no trace was left of them. Weeks later, a mangled corpse would be found downriver that would enable police to identify the identity of one of the bombers, leading to the discovery of their dynamite-filled apartment and the identity of the second bomber who had been his roommate. This act of terrorism has only set back the Irish republican cause, as many are disgusted by the senseless destruction that was attempted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLERKENWELLEXPLOSION;A bombing perpetrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood to free one of their imprisoned members has struck the Clerkenwell prison. The explosion damaged nearby houses, killing 12 and injuring 120. It has been described in the papers as a crime of unexampled atrocity and compared to the Gunpowder Treason of 1605. Several Fenians were identified and convicted of the act. The bombing has massively set back the Irish republican cause, as most Irish detest the senseless violence the Fenians have perpetrated against common people of England that are not themselves responsible for the oppression the Irish have faced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAHTRAWAR;The promulgation of the Peasants' Act of $YEAR$, which many Estonian villagers had hoped would aid their dismal living conditions, was almost incomprehensibly complex in its limits on provision of aid. The perplexed villagers of Mahtra gathered at the manors of their local nobles to demand an explanation and express their disappointment. The nobles, frightened of the prospect of an uprising, then called in punitive regiments from Tallinn to disperse the villagers. This was at first effective, but as news of the event spread, hundreds of villagers of the neighboring countryside congregated in Mahtra to counter the troops. They begrudgingly began to disarm, when one feisty villager punched the commander of the troops and he gave the order to fire. In the following battle, 7 villagers died and the troops escaped, enabling the villagers to loot the manors of the town and get drunk on the wineries. They had planned to attack the manors of neighboring villages but were too inebriated to proceed, thus ending the 'War'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUTTAX;Colonel Frederic Cardew, governor of Sierra Leone, has established a new yearly tax on the natives based on the size of their huts, small huts being 5 shillings and ones with four or more rooms being 10 shillings. Cardew, a professional soldier with service in India and Africa has no administrative experience and failed to realize that this tax exceeds the actual value of the huts and is a great burden on their inhabitants. Following his refusal to accept a petition by 24 chieftains to end the tax, he has arrested Bai Bureh, a local leader suspected of conspiring against the colonial government. This has angered the natives and led to skirmishes in the hinterlands. Cardew suggests a scorched earth policy to force them to pay up, which would surely lead to open revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DOGTAX;In the 1890s, the Hokianga County Council imposed a tax of half a crown per dog. Many of the Maori who lacked funds heard of the threat of exile to the ice-bound wastes of the southern island in retaliation to inability or refusal to pay the tax and fled the tax collectors. Some organized in self-defense under leader Hone Toia, leading to the formation of a band of around 150 native warriors. Colonial troops sent to disband them disengaged after two warning shots were fired, leading to a stand-off in which neither side wished to escalate. Mediation by Maori representative Hono Heke Ngapua led to a bloodless settlement in which the dog tax persisted and Hone Toia was arrested but it was agreed that nobody unable to pay the tax would be sent to the icy wastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHLCIVILWARZERO;All attempts of compromise have failed.

DAMSELWAR;Following the implementation of a new forest code in the Ariège aimed at increasing the lumber production and enabling more efficient development of the region, villagers have begun showing up to logging sites dressed as women to destroy equipment and scatter logs with the goal of preventing deforestation. By dressing as women, the locals avoid identification and can place blame on mysterious 'maidens of the woods' protecting their forests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PETROLEUMREVOLUTION;Libertarians and syndicalists in the city of Alcoy called for a general strike to enforce demands of a 20% increase in wages and reduction of working hours from 12 to 8. While the manufacturers debated these demands, a mob gathered in the plaza in front of city hall to await the decision. Municipal guards were called in to disperse the crowd and resorted to firing live bullets. This in combination with the manufacturers refusing all demands of the strikers led to them arming themselves and taking control of the streets. The revolutionaries stormed city hall and killed the mayor, setting up an ill-fated provisional government and proclaiming the independence of Alcoy from Spain. Thereafter they ran amock, murdering priests, nobles and the bourgeois in the name of the revolution. The entire city was purported to smell of petroleum as it was used to fuel their torches. The rebels quickly scurried away when federal troops arrived and resistance was wiped out before the week was out with countless arrests and prison sentences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPOOKYSHIP;Launched on May 18, 1861 with the name Amazon, over 100ft long and 25ft wide, damaged severely in a 1867 storm, refitted and renamed, the Mary Celeste is an American brigantine that has been mysteriously found abandoned by the Canadian Dei Gratia midway between the Azores and Portugal. It had been heading from New York to Genoa with a cargo of 1700 barrels of denatured alcohol under the command of captain Benjamin Spooner Briggs, a first-time captain with 18 years of experience as a sailor, his 7 crew members, wife and baby. The ship has some damage to its sails and rigging and no evidence of fighting, but the only life boat is missing. Damage is too light to cause the experienced crew to have abandoned ship. The last logbook entry dates 7 days before the discovery of the ship, coordinates placing it 740km West of where it was found. Many theories have been posited, but no conclusive explanation has been found. The ship has been brought to Gibraltar and been resold after the Dei Gratia cashed its salvage reward following a court investigation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

His power-hungry son, 'Abdu'l Said ibni al-Marhum, is much more cooperative and has long saught to gain the throne of Sintang. If we deposed Muhammad Jamal ud-din in favor of his son, we could both capture the sultanate and install a grateful, legitimate heir as ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ALBANIANREVOLTVLORA;The Albanians have been periodically revolting since the 1833 Shkodër uprising in protest of new taxes and centralization measures. Using their expert knowledge of the mountainous terrain, the rebels can appear out of nowhere to ambush our troops only to seemingly vanish into thin air. A new revolt has begun in the Vlora region lead by the experienced revolutionary Tafil Buzi, demanding the end of taxation of Albanians and the reapplication of previously granted privileges among the Balkan people. If we agree to these demands, we can avoid fighting the rabble, but it will greatly damage the administration and embolden rebels throughout the rest of the Balkans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NORTHALBREVOLT;After witnessing the denial of reforms and the brutal repression of the revolt in the South of Albania in 1836, the Albanians of the North have taken up arms. This revolt is far more extensive despite being unorganized, with separate uprisings independent of one another taking place in Mat, Myzeqe, Kosovo and Dibër. The pressure to agree to their demands is ever mounting, but once again we must consider that bending to the Albanians would motivate rebel movements all over the Balkans and make us seem weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SAGALLO_FIRST_EVENT;Nikolay Ivanovitch Achinov (an adventurer, and burgess of Penza) has taken it upon himself to establish a Russian settlement the Gulf of Tadjoura in Djibouti. Claiming the abandoned fort at Sagallo, Achinov rechristened the site as New Moscow. This action, with questionable approval from the Russian state, was no doubt as much an effort by Achinov to win himself a place in history as it was to benefit the motherland. Besides ignoring our rightful colonial authority, the conduct of his little band of Cossacks has quickly drawn the ire of the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAGALLO_NO_RESISTANCE;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has seceded the colony of Sagallo in Djibouti to us as a response of the landing of Russian adventurer Nikolay Ivanovitch Achinov! Achinov, who arrived with a small band of Cossacks, has dubbed his settlement New Moscow. He is now eagerly awaiting a state delegation. It is undoubtedly now in our best interest to grant his expedition our official backing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAGALLO_RESISTANCE;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has expelled Russian colonists from Sagallo in Djibouti! The colonists, led by the adventurer Nikolay Ivanovitch Achinov, had established a small fort by the name of New Moscow and claim to have acted in our name. It is likely the expulsion is a result of the ostentatious conduct of Achinov and his band, which has quickly garnered attention from local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities. Regardless, this is a direct affront by a foreign power against citizens of the motherland, and is thus worth our consideration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAGALLO_RUSSIAN_THREAT;It seems the Russians have chosen to put the full force of the state behind Achinovs antics. Their diplomatic posture has become increasingly hostile since the expulsion of the offending colonists. Now, they demand that we relent and surrender the whole of Djibouti to them! How shall we respond to this escalation of demands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAGALLO_THREAT_REFUSED;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to hand over colonial control of Djibouti! Every day that passes without the reinstatement of Achinov and his expeditioners, our claim to the territory weakens. If we wish to salvage our claim to Djibouti, we must take immediate and decisive action, or face the consequences of this massive diplomatic embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAGALLO_NO_BACKDOWN;It seems that the Russians, scrambling to put weight behind this foolhardy colonial play, has chosen to make good on their outrageous demands. An official from the Russian consulate, themselves barely aware of the situation, has informed us that Russia has escalated the dispute over Djibouti to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAGALLO_BACKDOWN;It seems cooler heads have prevailed within the Russian administration, and they have backed down from the dispute over Djibouti at the last second. Commitment to our rightful control over the land reflects well on us, and makes the actions of the Russians appear even more inappropriate. Achinov was a fool to test us, and it seems his countrymen are all the same!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CUBAN_INDP_WAR_OUTBREAK;Despite ever-increasing concessions to the territory of Cuba, we remain unable to eradicate unrest amongst the Cubanos. Firebrands as such José Martí, Máximo Gómez, and Antonio Maceo, many of whom have previously been involved in seditious revolutionary activity, have incessantly stirred public sentiment against our longstanding administration. Though poorly equipped, rebel bands have spread throughout the region such that even our enhanced garrison is unable to root them out. Our position on the Island is rapidly deteriorating, and local officials stress that this is nothing less than a true war of independence. We must take decisive action lest we forfeit the final vestiges of our great American empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIRST_FIJI_EXPD;On the Island of Fiji, Chief Seru Epenisa Cakobau has declared himself king. Though by all means a respectable warrior, his fellow chiefs scoff at his claim. In the resulting conflicts, John Brown Williams, an American merchant, has had his house in Fiji set on fire twice and some goods looted from his stores. The USS John Adams, a frigate captained by Edward B. Boutwell, happens to already be enroute for a tour of the East Indies. The plight of Williams could easily be used as grounds to divert the John Adams to conduct a punitive expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SECOND_FIJI_EXPD;We have received word from our consulate in Fiji that two American citizens on the Fijian island of Waya were captured by natives and cannibalized. Though diligent missionary work has converted many native Fijians to Christianity, some particularly remote Fijian villages still relish in the barbarity of the old ways. Much as we intervened on behalf of the merchant John Brown Williams but a few years ago, this incident could be used as grounds for a punitive expedition against the Fijians of Waya island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SECOND_SEMINOLE_WAR;Conflict between our administrators and the Seminole peoples of Florida has been ongoing since 1835, and intermittently since at least 1816. The conflict has proven to be our longest and most costly with a native American group yet, running up costs in the millions of dollars and resulting in the combat deaths of at least 300 servicemen. The Seminoles, a rather cosmopolitan group of diverse tribal origins who are even known to welcome run-away slaves, have proven to be extremely opportunistic, adaptive, and ferocious in their war-making. Heinous atrocities have been committed on both sides, yet our overwhelming material advantage has once again taken the day. As a token of good faith, some Seminoles will be allowed to remain in South Florida, but most have either been killed or forced to take the great trek west. The Second Seminole War is all but over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

THIRD_SEMINOLE_WAR;In the southern portions of Florida, a land previously thought inhospitable, the number of American settlers has been steadily increasing. Skirmishes with the Seminole peoples over this perceived encroachment beginning in late 1855 once again devolved into an open conflict. Hostile bands of Seminoles, have proved more than capable of ambushing militia alike. The conflict has largely disrupted the civil activities of South Florida, even requiring suspension of postal services. Finally, a delegation from the newly established Seminole reservation in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma arrived and was allowed through our lines. They successfully negotiated the removal west of the majority of remaining warriors in exchange for cash payments and safe travel. Only a few families opted to remain, retreating deep into the everglades, thus bringing this third and last Seminole war to a close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTELOPE_HILLS;The Antelope Hills campaign was one of the first expeditions into the Indian Territories of Oklahoma. Comanche raiders, known for their ferocity, had increasingly preyed upon Americans, having been blocked from incursions into Mexico and taking advantage of increased slavery-related tensions in our territories. Circumventing federal law, Texan Governor Hardin R. Runnels authorized John Salmon "Rip" Ford, a seasoned frontiersman and Indian fighter, to raise a band of rangers. The campaign culminated in Battle of Little Robe Creek, which was actually a series of skirmishes that saw Ford successfully harry the Comanches heartlands. Fords heavy-handed strategy of targeting non-combatants and food supply has proven extremely effective, and the Comanche threat has been significantly reduced despite a short campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COEUR_DALENE_WAR;A loose confederation of tribes including the Coeur DAlene (or Skitswish) in the Idaho territory came into conflict with the Army as they tried to preserve the integrity of their lands from would-be settlers. After reports of the death of a miner at the hands of Indians, a show-of-force Army column led by Colonel Edward Steptoe was first stopped by the allied Indians, and then forced to retreat under duress. General Newman S. Clarke offered peace terms to the alliance, but it could not be agreed upon by the tribal leaders. Clarke then led his command in a series of pitched battles against the tribes, who were compelled to come to terms to prevent their total annihilation. Hopefully this will reduce instability in the Northwest territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YAKIMA_WAR;The discovery of gold has greatly destabilized the Washington country, as miners and prospectors eagerly flock to the territory. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington territory, offered several favorable treaties to the native American tribes in the area, but these were largely outside of his authority to enforce. The tribes, led by the Yakima, have grown increasingly violent in their response to this supposed encroachment on their technically non-existent treaty rights by opportunistic settlers. Martial law was declared, and from 1855 a large garrison of army regulars was detached, and frequently skirmished with the highly competent Yakima warriors. Finally, the intensity of the conflict has subsided to the extent that the territory can largely be considered safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WHITE_RIVER_WAR;In 1879, members of the Ute tribe attacked the Indian agency on their land, killing the local agent, his men, and taking hostages. The agent, Nathan Meeker, had attempted to force the Ute to adopt farming and Christianity, resulting in backlash. An army column that was dispatched to reinforce the agency was almost simultaneously ambushed and forced to entrench themselves while sustaining casualties. After relieving the column, the army established a more permanent and defensible position. However, hostilities threatened to flare up again before our Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz interceded to impose peace during negotiations. Ultimately, the different Ute peoples were all removed to reservations, mostly in Utah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PHLWANTSTOBEFREE;The Philippine legislature, though it has no real political power, has decided to fund an independence mission to petition congress to grant the Philippines autonomy on their path to eventual independence. Our president has certified that the Filipino people have performed the condition imposed on them as a prerequisite to independence, declaring that, this having been done, the duty of the U.S. is to now set the Philippines on the road to independence. How will congress act in response to the independence mission?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIMOKREBELLION;As unrest in the countryside has been growing under helm of the People's Radical Party, the government ordered the local police to disarm peasants. In Timok, a village of the Zajecar district, local forces were particularly rude and violent in their attempt to seize the locals' weapons, sparking a revolt. As the news spread, members of the PRR in surrounding villages mobilized, storming their town halls and fighting the police. Within 10 days, the revolt was put down. Now, the leaders have been captured and we must decide what to do with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

invade_san_juan_desc;San Juan del Norte, Nicaragua's only Caribbean port, has long been disputed between our protectorate of the Mosquito Coast and Nicaragua. In 1841, Captain Alexander MacDonald sent an ultimatum to the Nicaraguan government to evacuate the town and kidnapped its mayor, abandoning him on a remote beach. Though he was forced to end this endeavor, it shows the vulnerability of the port. Nicaragua protested our official protectorate over the Mosquito Coast, sending troops to San Juan del Norte as a provocation. Miskito King George Augustus issued an ultimatum for the troops to be evacuated. Nicaragua has refused, asking the United States for help but getting no response due to their current involvement in a war with Mexico. Patrick Walker, our consul-general to the Miskitos suggests we strike while the iron is hot and invade the town immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANJUANBECOMESGREYTOWN;San Juan del Norte has been invaded by a joint Anglo-Miskito force, defeating our garrison with ease. It has been disputed with the Mosquito Coast for a while. This defeat has deprived us of our only Caribbean port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOMBARDGREYTOWN;The perfidious Brits invaded San Juan del Norte in 1848 with the Miskitos and renamed it to Greytown after the commander who was in charge of the operation. Nicaragua was thus deprived of its only Caribbean port. This, among other things, secures the proposed canal route through Nicaragua for the UK, a dangerous prospect. Now, news has arrived that Solon Borland, the American Minister to Central America, has been assaulted and kidnapped in broad daylight at the US consulate, by Miskitos. There must be retribution! Commander George N. Hollins of the USS Cyane has suggested he shell the port of Greytown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HEYTHEYBOMBARDEDGREYTOWN;News has reached us that the USS Cyan under Commander George N. Hollins has shelled Greytown to smithereens. While nobody died, the inhabitants are now all homeless. US President Franklin Pierce had this to say about the incident: 'The arrogant contumacy of the offenders rendered it impossible to avoid the alternative either to break up their establishment or to leave them impressed with the idea that they might persevere with impunity in a career of insolence and plunder.' This is in reference to the Miskito-British invasion of Greytown, which had formerly been known as San Juan del Norte and served as Nicaragua's only Caribbean port. Additionally, American Minister to Central America Solon Borland was recently assaulted and kidnapped from the US consulate by Miskitos. While Greytown lies in ruins for now, it will surely regenerate into a bundle of wooden shacks soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SANTAMARIAERUPTION;A frightening noise comparable to the roar of a waterfall was heard in San Felipe for 5 minutes on the side of the volcano but nothing could be seen because of the heavy fog. Pumice shortly followed by ash began to fall from the sky. Thereafter, the glow of lava and a noise like that of a blast furnace came from the Santa Maria volcano. Dormant for all of recorded history, Guatemala was utterly unprepared for the disaster despite the earthquake only 6 months serving as a warning sign. The eruption, lasting 36 hours, has released a column of ash that reaches 28 kilometers in height and has blocked out the sun for several days. The harvest in western Guatemala has been ruined by ash leading to a grain shortage. Aqueducts transporting water to cities are clogged. The devastation is so large that, for instance, even the San Pedro Sacatepéquez, 50 kilometers away from the volcano, has been almost entirely annihilated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANPERFECTOQUAKE;For several weeks, there has been heavy rainfall over Guatemala. Little did we know that this was but the calm before the storm. Minutes after 19:00, a frightening earthquake began, which shook the entire city of Quetzaltenango with terrifying intensity. After it subsided, another 8 smaller aftershocks were felt throughout the night. Between 800 and 900 people have perished and there is significant material damage in the extensive affected area. All churches in western Guatemala and eastern Chiapas are severely damaged or destroyed. Guatemala City was instantly flooded when massive gaps opened in the streets, water pipes ruptured and huts collapsed. In just one hour, approximately 80,000 people were made homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VALPARAISOQUAKE;At 7:55 PM, when most were eating, a subterranean blast was heard followed by the first tremor, lasting about four minutes. The shaking began lightly and slowly increased to a devastating climax, lasting 4 minutes in all. The second tremor occurred at 8:06 PM, starting out mild like the previous one, but convulsing ever more violently and surpassing the first quake, completing the ruin of the city in only 2 minutes. The city has practically been destroyed. Fires followed that burned the remaining rubble to a crisp. The Cardonal Market, Victory Theater, Intendancy, Victory Square, and Maritime Government were all reduced to debris. It is estimated that around 3000 inhabitants have died. Reverberations of the quake were felt all the way from Tacna to Puerto Montt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Only a frigate outfitted with a steam engine, she needed repairs several times, forcing the crew to rely on the sails instead of the shoddy steam engine for much of the distance. Stops were made for several weeks in Calcutta, Capetown and London to repair the engine and damage from storms. Now, despite these complications, the Amazon has entered the history books: She is the first Latin American ship to circumnavigate the globe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

During Minister Diego Portales' inspection of Colonel José Antonio Vidaurre's garrison of Quillota, the colonel used the anti-war strife among many in the army to his advantage, starting a revolt and capturing Portales.

nitro_express_desc;The unveiling of the .450 Nitro Express by John Rigby & Company in 1898 heralds the beginning of the modern big game cartridge. Created from loading the already popular .450 Black Powder Express with cordite, the .450 NE is a fast and accurate cartridge capable of taking all African and Indian dangerous game. The term "Express" was coined by James Purdey in 1856, derived from the express train, to publicise the bullet velocity of his double rifles and became common parlance for many rifle cartridges. The addition of the word "Nitro" stems from the propellant used in these cartridges, cordite, which is composed of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
elephant_gun;The Elephant Gun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
elephant_gun_desc;As Europeans make inroads into Africa, guns are needed to handle the very large game encountered. This is for self-protection, food gathering, and sport. The first guns were the simple muzzle-loading shotgun designs already used for birds and loaded with solid balls of lead for use on large game. Due to their ineffectiveness on the largest game (up to 35 shots for a single elephant), they are developing into larger caliber black powder smoothbores. The projectiles are lead round balls or short conical slugs, sometimes hardened with antimony. These very large and very heavy firearms are the first to be known as the elephant guns, though their use also includes all thick-skinned dangerous game such as rhinoceros, hippopotamus and cape buffalo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
standard_diving_dress;Standard Diving Dress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
standard_diving_dress_desc;Standard diving dress, also known as hard-hat or copper hat equipment, or heavy gear, is a type of diving suit that has been developed for all relatively deep underwater work that requires more than breath-hold duration, which includes marine salvage, civil engineering, pearl shell diving and other commercial diving work, and similar naval diving applications. It consists of a diving helmet made from copper and brass or bronze, an air hose from a surface-supplied manually operated pump or low pressure breathing air compressor, a waterproofed canvas suit, a diving knife, and weights to counteract buoyancy, generally on the chest, back and shoes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NISREBELLION;Towards the end of 1840, the governor of Ni, Sabri Mustafa Pasha, began to collect the new taxes enacted in the Tanzimat Reforms. The locals claimed that the taxation exceeded their savings and so asked the authorities for more time. This they granted but, as is usual, they also provided incentive to pay off the taxes quickly by having troops hound peasants until the payments were made. Friction inevitably developed. Sabri Mustafa and the soldiers repeatedly harassed the villagers with requests for food, drink, and women. A Russian diplomat, Baron Lieven, who was crossing the area at the time, received petitions in hopes that he would be able to explain the villagers' plight in Istanbul. Even more calls for aid and liberation were sent to Belgrade. All of these peaceful actions lead to no improvement. Finally, in a meeting attended by over 600 families of villagers in the area, the decision to revolt was taken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

anglo_zanzibari_treaty_title;The Anglo-Zanzibari Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
anglo_zanzibari_treaty_desc;In 1822, Zanzibar signed the Moresby Treaty, the first of a series of anti-slavery treaties. It prohibited slave transportation South and East of the Moresby Line from Cape Delgado in Africa to Diu Head on the coast of India. The sultanate lost the revenue it would have received as duty on all slaves sold, so to make up for this shortfall it encouraged the development of the slave trade in Zanzibar itself. Ships from the Royal Navy were employed to enforce the anti-slavery treaties by capturing any transports carrying slaves, but with only four ships patrolling a huge area of sea, our navy found it hard to enforce the treaties as ships from France, Spain, Portugal, and the United States continued to carry slaves. The time has finally come to pose an ultimatum to Zanzibar: Either they abolish the slave trade once and for all or there will be immediate harsh consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fort_nemours_title;Fort Nemours;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fort_nemours_desc;Great Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark all control parts of the Gold Coast, profiting off the trade with the natives. We must gain such a territory of our own. Admiral Bouët-Willaumez suggests signing treaties with the kings of the Assini region, placing their territories under a French protectorate. The construction of a fort in the area would solidify our control. We even have dated claims to the area: Fort Saint-Louis lasted from 1701 to 1704 and served as a slave trading post, however it was abandoned due to unprofitability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUDSONSCHOOL;Thomas Cole took a steamship up the Hudson in the autumn of 1825, hiking high into the eastern Catskill Mountains of New York to paint the first landscapes of the area. With these, he founded the Hudson River School of painting. Its themes include nationalism, nature, and property, depicting the American landscape as a pastoral setting, where human beings and nature coexist peacefully, an aesthetic vision influenced by Romanticism. Painters of the Hudson River School classically depict the Hudson River Valley and its surroundings, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and White Mountains. More recently, the scope of the paintings has expanded to include other locales in New England, the Maritimes, the American West, and South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bonsack_machine;Bonsack Machine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bonsack_machine_desc;Traditionally, cigarettes are rolled by hand. The slow manual fabrication process-a skilled cigarette roller could produce only about four cigarettes per minute on average-was insufficient to satisfy demand by the 1870s. Thus, James Albert Bonsack set out to create a machine able to roll cigarettes. It can produce an average ofa 200 cigarettes per minute, an immense improvement on handrolling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bull_jack;Bull Jacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bull_jack_desc;Filling, weighing and labeling bags of tobacco is a time-consuming, work-intensive but necessary process that makes the production of tobacco more expensive. The Bull Jack, however, automates all three of these steps, streamlining the production process and making it significantly cheaper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
burley_tobacco;Burley Tobacco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
burley_tobacco_desc;Used primarily for cigarette production, the newly introduced breed of tobacco known as Burley is strong-tasting, light and air-cured. This simple process involves leaving the tobacco to dry in a shed for two months, whereas other breeds require special equipment for their drying procedures. Burley's pH value is neutral, in contrast to the sourness of many other tobacco varieties that can make their consumption unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
camp_coffee;Camp Coffee;;;;;;;;;;;;;
camp_coffee_desc;Made up of sugar, water, chicory extract and a little bit of dried coffee extract, camp is a dark brown, syrupy liquid with a smooth flavour of chicory and coffee and a very sweet, predominantly chicory aftertaste. Its preparation does not require the expensive equipment needed for coffee. Most importantly, it is cheaper since it doesn't need to be shipped from coffee-growing areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shade_tobacco;Shade Tobacco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shade_tobacco_desc;With cigars increasing in popularity to the point that they are supplanting pipes, demand for cigar wrappers has grown steadily. To accommodate for this, a new breed of tobacco has been created using different samples from Cuba and Sumatra. This hybrid, grown in the shade of a "tent" made up of fabric suspended from a system of wires, has leaves so golden and smooth that they dominate the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
teabags;Teabags;;;;;;;;;;;;;
teabags_desc;By placing tea in porous so-called teabags, the brewing process is made much more efficient. Instead of placing tealeaves directly into the kettle or within a filter in one's mug, the teabag may be inserted and removed from the mug with ease, allowing re-use and a more efficient brewing process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coarse_picking;Coarse Picking;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coarse_picking_desc;With the newly pioneered technique of coarse picking of tealeaves, more tea is harvested as opposed to the traditional fine picking. Leaves of lower quality would be left on the plant and only select leaves of high quality would go on to be processed. Though the quality of the tea is reduced by the new technique, this is more than made up for by the large boost in output achieved thereby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sweet_sorghum;Sweet Sorghum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sweet_sorghum_desc;Many varieties of sorghum grass have been discovered to have a high sugar content. Especially practical for syrup production, sweet sorghum has begun being introduced to more northern fields on which sugar cane and beets have a harder time growing. Thus, sweet sorghum, a productive and high-yielding plant, allows us to significantly increase our sugar production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

sugar_centrifuging_desc;Molasses, a viscous substance resulting from refining sugarcane or sugar beets into sugar, is often used in processes such as cooking, baking or distilling rum. Now, however, molasses can be centrifuged to extract further commercial sugar. This is achieved by spinning the fluid at high speed within a container, thereby separating fluids of different densities and liquids from solids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

acorn_coffee_desc;When coffee imports are limited by war, trade bottlenecks or other misfortunes, the search for alternatives begin. While chicory and dandelions have long been used for coffee substitutes, a new and even cheaper source has been discovered: Acorns. While the taste certainly is a significant step down from coffee beans, beggars can't be choosers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coffea_robusta;Coffea Robusta;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coffea_robusta_desc;The commonly cultivated Coffea Arabica variety of coffee has increasingly fallen prey to Hemileia vastatrix, known commonly as coffee rust, often destroying entire harvests.

postum_desc;Due to concerns about the health effects of the consumption of coffee's caffeine, a new powdered roasted grain beverage has been introduced: Postum. Marketing centers around avoiding so-called "coffee-nerves", the irritability, lack of sleep and fatigue that result from caffeine consumption. It is especially popular among Mormons and other religious groups that abstain from coffee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
column_still;Column Still;;;;;;;;;;;;;
column_still_desc;Consisting of two columns, a column still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor. The first column has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. This process is far more efficient than traditional pot stills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chloralkali_process;Chloralkali Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chloralkali_process_desc;Chlorine, a powerful oxidising chemical that is often used to bleach textiles, has long been produced in the form of calcium hypochloride in a process pioneered by 18th-century chemists and inventors Charles Tennant and Charles Macintosh. However, with the advent of electricity, a new production method, the chloralkali process, has been discovered. It involves the electrolysis aqueous sodium chloride, a brine, in a membrane cell, producing chlorine gas that can be produced quicklier and bleaches more efficiently than calcium hypochloride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1853MILAN;After the unsuccessful events of the Revolts of 1848, Italians have continued struggling for independence motivated by farmous revolutionaries like Giuseppe Mazzini. A new insurrectionary committee was secretly created in Milan to organize a new revolt. They initially considered revolting during the great ball on the Palazzo Marino where many high-ranking Austrian officers could be captured, but this was abandoned in favor of a more thought-out plan. However, the revolt ultimately broke out spontaneously. At 4:45 PM, about a thousand men armed only with knives and daggers attacked the Austrian guard posts and barracks. Constructing barricades, the insurgents clashed with guards from the Porta Romana to the Piazza del Duomo and from the Porta Ticinese to the Porta Vercellina. Ultimately, the revolt was crushed, achieving nothing but the death of 17 soldiers and 16 rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;
KUMANOVOUPRISING;Following the Serbian liberation of Ni, Serbians in the area of Kumanovo have become restless, hoping they too will soon be liberated from Ottoman rule. The straw that broke the camel's back was forty marauding Albanian deserters returning from the front who broke into the house of a serf living near Bujanovac, tied up the men, looted the house and raped his daughters before his eyes, then leaving the village. The serf armed himself and persuaded the village to retaliate, tracing the attackers' prints through the snow. They eventually beat all forty to death. This small group of retaliatory villagers has quickly grown into an uprising, with the rebels riding armed on horseback through the villages of Kumanovo and Kriva Palanka. Their motto is 'Unity or Death', a demand that they join the Kingdom of Serbia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Any legislative provision, any senatus-consultum, decree, regulation or ordinances to the contrary are abolished.' \nIn short, the decree would grant citizenship and equal rights to the jews of Algeria. Although few in number, they have been cooperative and loyal to our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Two other attempts on his life had already failed, but his luck has finally run out. He ruled for 32 years, dying at age 56. The people have raised voices against and in favor of the regicide, the latter of which has been suppressed by a new law against 'apologism for regicide'. Vittorio Emanuele II, the heir to the throne who was on a cruise with his wife at the time of the assassination has been crowned king. The assassin has been sentenced to life in prison in the remote penitentiary of Santo Stefano on the island of Ventotene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC34605;In 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize some perturbing body whose gravity may be influencing Uranus. On multiple occasions prior, this body was observed, but astronomers had assumed it was a far-away star due to it being so dim. Only now, in $YEAR$ have Johann Gottfried Galle and his student Heinrich Louis d'Arrest spotted the celestial body and correctly identified it as a planet, naming it Neptune. After two further nights of observations in which its position and movement were verified, Galle has informed the scientific community. The discovery telescope was an equatorial mounted achromatic refractor by Joseph Fraunhofer's firm Merz und Mahler in the Berlin Observatory.;;;;;;;;;;;;

ALEXANDERASSASSINATION;While returning to the Winter Palace from the Mikhailovsky riding academy in his bulletproof closed carriage at 2:15PM, Emperor Alexander II was assassinated. First, a bomb was thrown under the carriage, but due to its sturdy construction, Alexander II emerged dazed but unharmed. He expressed solicitude for the injured passersby. Then, suddenly the second bomber struck, throwing an explosive at the emperor's feet. An explosion ripped through the air. Alexander was leaning on his right arm, his legs shattered below the knee from which he was bleeding profusely, his abdomen torn open, and his face mutilated. He could barely whisper: 'Take me to the palace... there... I will die.' He was carried by sleigh to his study in the Winter Palace where he was given communion and last rites with the rest of the Romanovs rushing to his side. At 3:30PM that day, his personal flag was lowered for the last time. Investigation and interrogation of the two arrested assassins has revealed that the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya ('People's Will') being behind this, a revolutionary political organization aiming to overthrow the tsardom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

khivan_campaign_title;The Khivan Campaign of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
khivan_campaign_desc;The Khanate of Khiva is South of the Aral Sea in the delta of the Oxus River with a population of about half a million. Khiva has been continually capturing peasants from the Orenburg region and fishermen venturing to the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea to serve as slaves. Demands to free them have ended in caravans of a couple dozen old men that were no longer useful as slaves. While it is our moral obligation to free our citizens, Khiva is an oasis surrounded by several hundred miles of steppe and desert. We could easily defeat their army but the real challenge is crossing the steppe. General-adjutant Count Vasily A. Perovsky has proposed requisitioning thousands of camels and carts from Kazakhs and Bashkirs in our domain to frm a supply line that could support a force of five thousand men marching South. Shall we undertake this risky endeavor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KHIVAGOESSOUTH;News has reached us from the Perovsky's column heading towards Khiva. Since the grass of the steppe separating us from Khiva dies down in Summer, Spring and Autumn are the best times for travel in the area. However, Winter was was chosen as the time to begin the expedition as it reduces the need for water. Winter snow and cold are not too bad in normal years, but $YEAR$ is not a normal year. Snow began to fall only 6 days after leaving Orenburg. 16 days later, thermometers froze as temperatures dipped to -35 degrees Celsius. Perovsky has requested to turn back as the column has all but ground to a halt due to the masses of snow. Around half of the camels and one fifth of the soldiers have already frozen to death, many others becoming unfit for duty. Forcing them to continue would be a suicide mission without extensive support and even so would incur staggering losses. Perovsky has progressed halfway to Khiva, so the worst is yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MENALAMBAREVOLT;With Madagascar firmly in our hands, the inhabitants have become violent in their resistance against the administration. A revolt named the Menalamba ("red shawl") Uprising, principally conducted by common peasants who wear shawls smeared with the red laterite soil of the highlands, has struck the island. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity, and political corruption is spreading quickly, however it shouldn't be too difficult to defeat as it isn't centrally lead. It is simply a combination of multiple simultaneous revolts with similar motives that can be engaged one by one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BASUTOGUNWAR;Following Basutoland's transformation into a British royal domain, it has become the target of rapid westernization efforts by the Cape Colony administration. The newly enacted Peace Preservation Act has now been extended to Basutoland with the aim of disarming the Basuto people. However, the Basuto immensely value their guns and have therefore, compounded by past grievances, begun a revolt led by chiefs Lerotholi Letsie and David Masopha. A war in the mountains of Basutoland would surely be quite costly to little end. Perhaps a peaceful settlement would be a better solution to this conflict than fighting it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ISATAYTAIMANOV;An uprising has begun against Zhangir-Kerey Khan, our puppet ruler of the Bukey Horde. The rebels are angry about the use of their horse pastures for agricultural purposes, especially in lands located along the Bolshoy and Maly Uzen rivers and around the Kamysh-Samarsky lakes. Nearby clans of Kazakhs have joined their cause in an effort to rid themselves of Russian influence. Isatay Taimanov, the leader of the uprising, is gathering a force of tribesmen that has been continually growing, posing a threat to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAPANIINCIDENT;Taiwanese Han and Aboriginals have begun an uprising against our rule, declaring a revival of the Ming dynasty under a breakaway state called Da Ming Cibeiguo, or the "Great Ming Compassionate Kingdom." Popular discontent with Japanese rule in Taiwan has generated this uprising, inspired by the Boxer Rebellion and taking on similar religious underpinnings. Much like the Boxers, these rebels even believe they are invincible to bullets because the gods will protect them. This rag-tag band of nutcases will not be difficult to defeat, but their rabblerousing presents a worrying sign pointing to future unrest on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KENESARYKASIMOV;Kenesary Kasimov has long been a thorn in our side. Son of Kasym Khan and brother of Sarzhan Khan, he ascended to the throne of the Greater Juz in 1841. He became infamous in 1837 after his forces captured a caravan moving from Petropavlovsk to Tashkent despite being accompanied by a convoy of 55 Cossacks. He has continually raided caravans, besieged forts and evaded attempts at capturing him. Additionally, he waged war on the Khanate of Kokand to the South of the Greater Juz, a sort of retreat from our advance in the North. Now, he has finally met is fate - at the hands of Kokand. Despite being whittled down to a force of but 500 men, he insisted on fighting on, never losing hope for Kazakhstan. This renders Kazakhstan a snake without a head: With the last Khan dead, the Kazakhs are divided and leaderless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BIOKOLEASE;When Spain abandoned the island of Bioko in 1827 due to tropical diseases, the leased it to us as a base to patrol the West African slave trade from. Now, seeing our success at colonizing the island, they have revoked the lease, demanding we return the island to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FIRSTZEITUN;The Armenians of Zeytun have long had near-complete autonomy within the empire, paying no taxes and administering themselves in their mountain town. Following an ethnic clash in the nearby village of Ketman, Aziz Pasha, governor of Marash, used this as a pretext to attack the area, laying siege to Zeytun. However, despite his large army of 40.000 conscripts, he was unable to beat the determined and fortified Armenians who fiercely resisted attacks and weathered the siege. Aziz Pasha had to turn back after sustaining massive casualties, unable to crush the seemingly mountain fortress that Zeytun proved to be. This conflict has caught the attention of Armenians throughout the empire with protests erupting in Konstantiniyye, Van and Mush..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SECONDZEITUN;The autonomous mountain town of Zeytun has continued to be virtually independent from Konstantiniyye despite the failed attempt to subjugate them in 1862. Now, a new attempt has been made and spectacularly failed. Around 60.000 men were assembled to attack Zeytun and the surrounding villages, killing roughly 6.000 defenceless peasants. Then, amazingly, a tiny Armenian militia of less than 2.000 men began completely wrecking the army. It sustained about 15.000 casualties before having to retreat from the terrifying militia. Zeytun has once again kept its autonomy by the skin of its teeth and humiliated our army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANDALUSIAQUAKE;The province of Granada has been suddenly devastated by a violent earthquake. Arenas del Rey was most damaged, with 90% of houses collapsing and the rest suffering serious damage, while Alhama de Granada had the most victims with 463 dead, more than half of the estimated 800 casualties in all. Aside from the damage caused by the shaking of the ground itself, several landslides were set into motion that blocked roads. Because of fear of said afterquakes, many who still had houses opted to live on the street instead to avoid the danger of it collapsing on their heads in spite of the cold. Now, more people are dying due to exposure to the elements and lack of supplies than died to the initial quake itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TIVISAQUAKE;An earthquake has struck the Ribero del Ebro region in Catalonia between the towns of Bajo Campo, El Priorato and Bajo Ebro with multiple aftershocks. Tivisa was hit hardest with many buildings including the church being heavily damaged. Several wide cracks formed near the town that filled with boulders dislodged by the quake. One villager reported an unfathomable hole on a nearby hill 'in which he threw several stones without the sound of their fall being heard' that emitted a sulfurous stench. The earthquake was also felt in Tortosa and Barcelona without any damage being sustained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOMBONAMGYE;Gombo Namgye, born the son of a chieftain in the desolate Nyarong valley, united the three chiefdoms of the valley in the 1840s. Residents of the Nyarong valley long had to resort to raiding traders passing through the region to make a living due to the desolation and infertility of their home. Thus, the people of the valley are quite ferocious and warlike. United under Gombo, they quickly began overrunning neighboring principalities, conquering the Hor States, Derge and Litang. Their bloodthirsty reputation led Golog, Nangchen, Serta and Jyekundo to willingly submit to Gombo's rule. Now, after a string of victories, his state of Nyarong encompasses nearly the entirety of Kham. This barbarian upstart has in a few strokes deprived our empire of the fruits of centuries of painful conquests and intrigues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our maritime destiny is also backed up by the fact that we have nowhere to go on the continent due to our excellent natural barriers to other countries. The Atacama Desert protects us in the North, the great Andes in the East and the fjords and glaciers in the South.

This threat to our country may be countered by purchasing the islands from their current owner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIROTREBELLION;The regions of Pirot, Belogradchik and Berkovitsa have risen up in revolt. Local Orthodox Christians have faced oppression by the local Muslim Ayan, Mahmud. The revolt was organized by refugees headed by a wealthy and respected local named Hadi-Nea Filipovic who fled to Serbia to escape Ottoman rule. Prince Milo Obrenovic of Serbia promised them support in their revolt, leading them to eagerly cross the border and incite the Orthodox Christians of the region to revolt against us, however he has now betrayed and abandoned them to be crushed by our army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
howes_sewing_machine;Howe's Sewing Machine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
howes_sewing_machine_desc;While trying to invent an innovative new type of sewing machine, Elias Howe had a nightmare in which he was hunted with spears that were pierced near the head. This inspired him to make sewing needles with an eye at the point. Other important advances made by Howe's machine are a shuttle operating beneath the cloth to form lockstitch loops, and an automatic feed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
barbed_wire_fencing;Barbed Wire Fencing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
barbed_wire_fencing_desc;Conventional wooden fences to contain cattle are quite expensive, so many farmers are forced to resort to let their cows roam free. This leads to some getting lost or hurt. Barbed wire, aside from military use, is a cheap and effective alternative to wooden fencing, as its pricks keep the cows contained without hurting them significantly. This solves non-barbed wire's problem: The cows simply push against it and knock it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ALBREVOLTEIGHTEENFOURTYSEVEN;As part of the implementation of the Tanzimat Reforms, a new taxation system has been put into place in Albania. However, to force the rebellious locals to cooperate, our forces have resorted to violently disarming them. People came to fear our troops, fleeing their homes at news of the approaching soldiers. In reaction, Albanians gathered in Mesaplik and formed an assembly, sending us a memorandum declaring that they will not contribute soldiers to the regular army and will not pay the new taxes. Our administration has ignored the memorandum and attempted to collect taxes, causing an open revolt to begin under the leadership of Çelo Picari, a survivor of the Massacre of the Albanian Beys with a vendetta against our government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVOLT1845;In spite of recent revolts in Albania failing, the local population continues to mistrust and resent our local administration to an extreme extent due to the recent centralization measures undertaken in the process of the Tanzimat Reforms. This has caused a new uprising to erupt, with two thousand people rebelling in the Yakova area and spreading the revolt to the highlands where the cities of Reka and Deçan as well as the region of Mirdita have been captured. This has swelled their ranks to eight thousand rebels. Though retaking the cities back from the insurrection shouldn't be too difficult, dislodging the militants from the mountains will certainly be a costly affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRSJAKREVOLT;Rebels seeking the separation of Macedonia from the Ottoman Empire have begun a revolt in the Porece region of the Monastir Vilayet. The rebels use the Serbian flag in battle and are reported to have received covert Serbian government support -- supplies of rifles and ammunition. While the revolt is relatively small, centering around Ohrid, Prilep and Monastir, the rebels are well entrenched in their familiar mountains, making them difficult to dislodge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SASUNREBELLION;The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (SDHP), founded in 1887 by a group of students in Geneva, Switzerland, was created to achieve the independence of Armenia. To this end, they have stoked nationalist sentiments among the Armenians West of Lake Van, culminating in a major revolt centered around the town of Sasun. Armenian patriots have organized so-called fedayi, irregular militia units, to do battle with our army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GALVEZDEPOSED;The peasant insurgency in Guatemala, started by priests spreading conspiracy theories about the liberal government being responsible for the cholera outbreak, became stronger over the course of the last year, with the scorched earth policy of our army only increasing the unrest. José Rafael Carrera y Turcios, the leader of the fanatic Christian conservative insurgents organized a 'people's army', a force of twelve thousand peasants to wage a 'holy war' against the liberals. Now, our worst fears have come to pass: News has reached us that Turcios marched to Ciudad Guatemala with his forces and overwhelmed its defenders. Under shouts of 'Long live religion!', the rabble looted and pillaged the city, forcing governor José Felipe Mariano Gálvez to flee with his administration and remaining troops. With Guatemala in chaos, the region of Los Altos, mainly populated by indigenous peoples and criollos, has seceded from Guatemala as a separate federal state within the FRCA. Across the federation, faith in the government has collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUATEMALACHOLERA;An outbreak of cholera has devastated Guatemala, hitting the indigenous community particularly hard. Around a thousand people have died and while another three thousand survived with great suffering. Hardline reactionary priests who resent the liberals appropriating their property and restricting their power have spread a conspiracy theory that the government has poisoned rivers and wells with cholera to targetedly kill indigenous peoples. The poor peasants have, infuriated by this nonsense, begun fighting against the power of the liberal governor Guatemala, José Felipe Mariano Gálvez. José Rafael Carrera y Turcios, an illiterate but cunning and charismatic former pig farmer turned highwayman has emerged at the head of the resistance as a new caudillo. Only time will tell whether the forces of our liberal government or the ignorant, conservative peasants blinded by religion will come out on top in this so-called 'holy war'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EPIRUSREVOLT;With the onset of conflict with Russia, separatist Greeks in the region of Epirus have used the opportunity to rise up in revolt. Spyridon Karaiskakis, a Lieutenant in the Greek Army, gave a number of stirring speeches in villages east of Arta, seeking to inspire the Epirotes to revolt against us and join their province to Greece. He and other agitators have whipped up anger among the Epirote villagers and have begun marching to the cities of Metsovo, Ioannina and Arta, posing a significant threat to our continued possession of the region. Although the Greek government is officially neutral on the matter, covert sending of supplies to the rebels by Greek officials has been widely reported. The Greek arms and ammunition make the rebels especially dangerous, as they are able to organize effectively without having to use lesser or improvised weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
forest_railway;Forest Railway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
forest_railway_desc;A forest railway, forest tram, timber line, logging railway or logging railroad is a new use for railway transportation. It is employed for forestry tasks, primarily the transportation of felled logs to sawmills or railway stations. In most cases this form of transport uses narrow gauges, and are temporary in nature, and in rough and sometimes difficult to access terrain. This greatly improves the efficiency of logging, as towing animals are no longer necessary to slowly pull log carts out of forests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MACEDONIANREBELLION;Macedonian Greeks have risen up in revolt to prevent being made part of a Bulgarian state. Many Greeks fear greater oppression under Bulgarian Slavic rule than under Ottoman and therefore strive to unite Macedonia with Greece before it is too late. The revolution has two main foci: One around Mount Olympus, and the other in the Vourinos mountain range. Around ten thousand rebels led by Anastasios Picheon have gathered in Vourinos and proclaimed the "Provisional Government of Macedonian province of Elimeia" seeking to unite with Greece. Chieftains all over Macedonia have answered the call and begun engaging our local garrisons in a campaign of guerrilla warfare ranging from Manastïr to Koçana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SALAVERRYSANTACRUZEXPLAIN;An invasion has entered Peru from the Southeast. Luis José de Orbegoso y Moncada, former liberal president of Peru, convinced Jossef Andrés de Santa Cruz y Calahumana, president of Bolivia, to invade Peru so as to help him regain his position as president. However, Santa Cruz has an even higher aim: Forcibly uniting Peru and Bolivia in a confederation. Supporters of Orbegoso have already seized the South, including Arequipa and Puno, giving great advantage to the Bolivian advance. §RYou must have a unit in Arequipa or have it unsieged by March 1836 and keep it as such until you win the war. Otherwise, Bolivia will annex you.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOCABAYA;We have defeated the so-called Army of the Restoration of Peru in a decisive battle. The joint Peru-Bolivian forces led by general Jossef Andrés de Santa Cruz y Calahumana simply outmatched Felipe Santiago Salaverry del Solar's battered and demoralized husk of an army. With Salaverry captured and executed, nothing stands in the way of uniting Peru and Bolivia once and for all. Viva Perú-Bolivia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOLIVIACONFEDERATESWPERU;Our armies have captured Lima, enforcing our law on the long-chaotic lands of Peru. Unionist sentiments between our two nations have existed for some time, and it seems the invasion was spurred by a combination of Peru's sorry state and the influence of one Agustín Gamarra Messia, President of Peru from 1829 to 1833, in Sucre. Gamarra has long held an obsession with the idea of uniting Peru with Bolivia, and has convinced president Andrés de Santa Cruz of an ambitious plan to assemble a confederation between Bolivia and a pair of states representing the North and South of Peru. With the formation of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, Bolivia and Peru will both surely enter an era of prosperity -- one which our jealous neighbors may seek to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now, the people of Latin America have come to accept and embrace their part in Spain.

BOSNIANREVOLT;Bosnia-Herzegovina has been enveloped in an revolt the likes of which has never been seen in the region. Catholic and Orthodox Christians have united against us. In recent years, local beys have levied increasingly exorbitant taxes and enforced their collection brutally. With the success of the Greek and Serbian Revolutions in mind, the rebels hope to use guerrilla tactics to draw out the conflict until the international community intervenes in their favor. Revolutionary leaders like Petar Popovic Pecija and Bogdan Zimonjic bring experience from previous uprisings, giving the insurgents further advantage. Rumors have even reached us of covert Montenegrin and Serbian support being channelled to the rebels in the form of guns and ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MATALE;The Kandyan provinces are in a state of turmoil. They have been under our adiministration for 32 years, in which time, under the Crown Lands Ordinance No. 12 of 1840, planters have expropriated the common land of the peasantry and reduced them to penury. In the 1830s, coffee was introduced into Ceylon, a crop which flourishes in high altitudes, and grown on the land taken from the peasants. However, the dispossessed peasantry aren't employed on the plantations as they refuse to abandon their traditional subsistence holdings and become wage-workers. We therefore had to draw on our reserve army of labour in India and brought plantation workers from the other side of the Palk Strait. A recent decline in the price of coffee lead to a deficit of 40,000 pounds in Ceylon's budget. To counteract this, the new governor, George Byng, 7th Viscount Torrington, enacted new direct taxes on the natives. These taxes bear heavily not only on the purse but also on the traditions of the Kandyan peasants, leading to a mass movement against them that has now erupted into a full-scale rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SNAKEWAR;The "Snake Indians" are so called for their proximity to the Snake River, though in reality theyre an eclectic group of Northern Paiute, Bannock and Western Shoshone peoples. Tensions between the Snake Indians and settlers date back to the early 1850s. By 1864, they boiled over into a series of attacks and reprisals from both sides that were effectively a war. While our own Civil War has divided and occupied our martial resources up to this point, we now have the capacity to pacify the region. Prior to our newly arbitrated treaty with chief Weahwewa, some 1,762 died on both sides, making this the deadliest Indian conflict to date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAKOTAWAR;In our previous treaties with the eastern Dakota people of the Sioux nation, significant provisions were made to the order of cash annuities, debt payments, and other boons. Unfortunately, as the Civil War has increasingly drawn our national attention, the Dakota have accused us of being delinquent in our obligations. In August of 1862, armed bands of Dakota attacked Minnesota settlements en-masse, killing several hundred and forcing the governor to organize a militia to confront them. Over 300 captured Indians have been sentenced to death, and though President Lincoln reduced the sentences of all but 39, the day of their hanging, December 26, 1862, will prove to be the largest one-day mass-execution in our nations history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PUGETSOUNDWAR;Our conflict with the native peoples in the Washington territory has come to a head, despite the attempts of territorial governor Isaac Stevens to negotiate a settlement with the Chief Leschi of the Nisqually tribe. Chief Leschi refused  our offer, the 1864 Treaty of Medicine Creek, outraged that we would barter for his people's lands. Subsequent skirmishes between our companies and warriors allied to the Nisqually have led to the two-year roundup of nearly 4,000 native non-combatants. Chief Leschi was finally captured by our troops in November of 1856 and now faces trial. This will hopefully bring our conflict with the Nisqually to a close, though other nations such as the Yakima continue to be a thorn in the Washington territorys side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLACKHAWKWARUTAH;Accounts of the origins of the conflict are unclear, but there is no doubting that a state of war has existed for some time between the predominantly Mormon settlers of central Utah, and the 16 Ute, Southern Paiute, Apache and Navajo tribes led by local Ute war chief Antonga Black Hawk. Between April of 1865 and October of 1872, over 100 individual attacks, skirmishers, murders, or massacres were conducted by both sides of the conflict as settler and native combatants became increasingly organized. Though Black Hawk negotiated peace in 1867, and the Utes were moved to the Uintah reservation, much animosity remains, and the conflict is expected to slowly peter out rather than come to abrupt end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAYUSEWAR;In 1847, members of the Cayuse tribe of the Oregon conducted the Whitman Massacre in retaliation for spread of disease and desecration of tribal lands. Fourteen were killed and several dozen were held hostage. Despite the governors show of force intended to bring about negotiations, the Cayuse carried on the conflict for several years, requiring federal intervention in spite of the Cayuse turn-over of five tribesmen claimed to be responsible for the massacre. Intermittent conflict is finally coming to a close as the remaining bands of warriors surrender or meet defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CUBACONST;Cuba has come a long way since the end of the Spanish-American War and the beginning of the occupation government. A Constitutional Assembly presided over by Domingo Méndez-Capote has created a new constitution for the island. Elections have taken place according to the constitutional framework, resulting in the victory of Tomás Estrada Palma, an independent candidate who received upwards of 60% of votes. Clearly, the time has come to withdraw our forces from Cuba, as it has become able to administer itself. However, several congressmen propose that we force the Assembly to adopt the so-called "Platt Amendment" - an amendment to their constitution that would allow us to intervene in Cuba militarily at will and ensure our influence indefinitely at the cost of Cuban self-determination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAYQUESADA;When Cuba became independent in 1902, we kept the Isle of Pines and Guantanamo Bay as per the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations. However, many Cubans, including those in government, have since perceived our administration of the Isle of Pines as unjust as they regard the island as core Cuban territory. To right this wrong, Cuban Special Commissioner Gonzalo de Quesada y Aróstegui has approached Secretary of State John Hay and proposed a treaty by which the island would be returned, as it were, to Cuba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BLUEREVOLUTION;Conservative conspiracies have finally boiled over in a swift takeover of government, deposing former president Manuel Ezequiel Bruzual. The unrest began in the form of regional uprisings that were quickly put down. However, due to the increasingly repressive central administration, the insurgent groups began to spread throughout the country. With the liberals abandoning Bruzual, the conservatives organized a small army to take over Caracas. He fled to Puerto Caballo with 300 men and was besieged. Bruzual was shot by a sniper at this last stand and fled to Curaçao where he has now died of gangrene. Guillermo Tell Villegas has assumed the presidency, ushering in a new era of conservatism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
APRILREVOLUTION;In only 3 days of fighting, a decisive landing of the liberals in Coro led by Antonio Guzmán Blanco has toppled the conservative government. It had been suffering from great instability, including armed uprisings led by José Ignacio Pulido Briceño, Joaquín Crespo, Matías Salazar, León Colina and Francisco Linares Alcántara. The citizens of Caracas had been so discontent under the government of Guillermo Tell Villegas that they assisted the liberal assault on the city. Antonio Guzmán Blanco has now become president and made it clear that he shall remain as such for the foreseeable future. The liberals are once again in power in Venezuela - for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COROREVOLUTION;General León Colina has begun an insurrection in the West to topple President Antonio Guzmán Blanco with the assistance of other defectors turning against the regime. Starting in Coro, the rebels have moved South and captured Barquisimeto. However, Colina is facing opposition from the locals. Over a thousand inhabitants of Coro have organized into pro-government militia and opposed him. The Coro Revolution already seems doomed to fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WHEREISRECONQUISTA;Spain has content pertaining to the reconquest of its former colonies in the Americas. You may be familiar with its implementation in HFM: For whatever reason, it was exclusive to Carlist Spain. Well, no more! Instead, the so-called third Reconquista is now tied to having Fernando VII as king as he was the last Spanish monarch to pursue the matter. However, he dies in 1833, so the third Reconquista is tied to the 1830 submod. You have to activate it upon starting if you wish to play with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

sugarbeet_nematodes_desc;First discovered by the botanist H. Schacht in 1859, sugarbeet nematodes or Heterodera schachtii create cysts on the roots of affected beets. With further analysis, it has surfaced that affliction with the nematode significantly reduces crop yield. Thus, new methods of combatting it have surfaced, such as breeding resistant beets or planting white mustard a field lies fallow, significantly reducing the nematode count in its soil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sugarbeet_seed_planter;Sugarbeet Seed Planters;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sugarbeet_seed_planter_desc;The process of planting sugarbeets by hand is very time-consuming, as each beet must be planted individually in a little hole that is manually dug out and covered once more.

ROGUERIVERWAR;Since the general uptick in settler activity in Oregon country beginning in the 1830s, relations with the native peoples have steadily deteriorated. This is especially true of the three tribes of the Rogue River area, which includes Athabascan, Takelma, and Shastan speaking tribes. Federal troops, not for the first time, were dispatched in May 1856 to intervene in the simmering conflict between the Indians and local militias. After the Rogue River Indians attacked federal columns, the US military assisted in several assaults against Indian camps, and ultimately removed the rogue river Indians to reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COLORADOWAR;After the 1858 discovery of gold in the Coloradan portion of the Rocky Mountains, we pressured chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho people to sign the Treaty of Fort Wise which reduced their lands by 90%. Many southern Cheyenne, including the 'Dog Soldiers' military sect, considered this a betrayal and refused to abide by the treaty. By 1864 the American military was largely occupied with the civil war which lead to several raids, skirmishes, and reprisals in the region. The conflict culminated in frequency following the Sand Creek massacre, in which Coloradan volunteer forces lead by Colonel John M. Chivington slaughtered 150 native non-combatants. The natives ultimately moved northwards towards Wyoming in 1865 of their own accord, continuing to conduct raids and eluding federal attempts to stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REDCLOUDWAR;The discovery of gold in Montana greatly expanded use of Bozeman's trail to access the region. This trail leads through the lands of several native American people, including the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Northern Arapaho, many of whom had been engaged in intertribal conflicts for some time. Attacks on travelers lead us to establish several forts in the region. The Lakota chief Red Cloud targeted these forts with several raids to wear down their garrisons. One such action, on December 21, 1866 known as Fetterman Fights, resulted in the total obliteration of an 81-man column led by  Captain William J. Fetterman, the worst defeat we have yet suffered in the Great Plains. In 1868, the Treaty of Fort Laramie was signed which, in exchange for closure of Bozeman's trail, land guarantees and the removal of forts, required the Lakota in particular to adopt several measures intended to lead to their assimilation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GOSHUTEWAR;The Goshute tribe are one of many Western Shoshone peoples residing in the Utah and Nevada territories. Since the arrival of predominantly Mormon settlers, the Goshutes have been forced onto increasingly marginal portions of their territory. The stream of 49ers and the mail stations that followed only increased tensions with the Goshutes, as well as incidents of raiding. In 1863, Union army forces pre-emptively attacked the Goshutes and forced a treaty upon them which allowed settler economic activity and extraction in their land in exchange for the federal government paying the tribe $1,000 a year for twenty years as compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAIUTEWAR;Since the late 1850s, American forces, officials, and volunteers have become increasingly involved in the conflicts and affairs of the Paiute people of Pyramid Lake in the Utah territory. by May 1860, a series of escalating raids and reprisals erupted into open conflict. A Paiute warband lead by chief Numaga ambushed a local militia organized to hunt them down, killing 76 men. Though unable to decisively defeat the Paiutes, local settlers re-organized their forces and established a series of forts around the lake to deny the Paiute's access to the hinterland, causing the conflict to peter out as many warriors perished of starvation. Interestingly, the conflict has greatly increased the prestige of the newly formed Pony Express. Despite numerous raids on their stations, Express riders nevertheless distinguished themselves for their speed and efficiency of service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
POSAVINAREB;In the northern Bosnian region of Posavina, located on the banks of the Sava river, a rebellion has broken out among the populace. There are rumors of Serbia's government having promised support, though there is no material evidence to definitively incriminate Serbia's leadership thus far. While most rebels seek to join Serbia like the districts of Jadra and Radevine managed to do years after the end of the Serbian Revolution, they also enjoy support from Muslim Bosniak noblemen who reject recent reforms such as the abolition of the Ayan system that lead to the Great Bosnian Uprising of 1831.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

During his long rule, Petar strengthened the state by uniting the often quarreling tribes, consolidating his control over Montenegrin lands and introducing the first laws. A man of uncommon size, handsome features, considerable talent, and a highly respected character, Petar will be dearly missed. Prior to his death, he dictated his will and testament, naming Petar II Petrovic-Njego as his successor and granting all of his ecclesiastical and secular powers to him. The will also curses anyone who tramples over Montenegro's traditional bonds with Russia in exchange for better relations with Austria, swearing that leprosy would strike them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SERMONUNION;Petar II Petrovic-Njego, ruler of the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro, Metropolitan of Cetinje and Exarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro has approached us with an offer. A proponent of uniting and liberating the Serb people, Petar II is willing to concede his princely rights in exchange for a union with Serbia and his recognition as the religious leader of all Serbs. While the king of Serbia shall become king of Montenegro, Petar II will become the head of the Serbian Orthodox church, a privileged and powerful position. A new era of union for the Serbian people has dawned, settling our differences with Montenegro forevermore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MARSORO;With news of the French Revolution reaching Stockholm, chaos has erupted in the city. At first, proclamations demanding reforms and defying the government began popping up across the city and several angry mobs formed. One crowd massed before the Hotel de la Croix where a banquet was taking place and threatened to storm the building, resulting in police violently dissolving it and arresting several stone-throwing rabble-rousers. This lead to another angry mob forming and interrupting King Oscar I on his way back from the opera. By listening to the crowd's complaints, promising the release of the arrested and a bit of careful persuasion, he managed to defuse the situation, dissolving the crowd peacefully. In another less fortunate incident, an angry crowd began looting shops, throwing stones and refusing to dissolve. Militia were called in and fired shots into the crowd, causing 18 casualties but successfully dissolving it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CANUDOS;Tensions have boiled over in the village of Canudos, Bahia, whose monarchist sympathies have escalated into open revolt against the republic. The inciting incident was a dispute over delivery of lumber: A local judge from neighboring Juazeiro ruled against the delivery of the wood to Canudos. In response, several Canudenses attempted to pick it up regardless. The judge responded to this by requesting police forces from the governor of Bahia, claiming that his town was being invaded by the Canudenses. The troops were initially dispatched to prevent the supposed invasion, but the judge convinced the commanding officer to march on Canudos instead, leading to a pitched battle in which several thousand villagers armed with farm equipment and old muskets faced off against the soldiers, driving them off. How will we settle this affair?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PALATINEDESC;Amid the general chaos of the revolutions of 1848, the Palatinate has risen up against our rule. Unlike the other Freischar that have caused chaos across Germany, they are not only seeking the unification of Germany and the adoption of a constitution but also demanding to be given independence from Bavaria. In a meeting in Kaiserslautern, over twelve thousand people gathered under the following slogan: "If the government becomes rebellious, the citizens of the Palatinate will become the enforcers of the laws." A ten-man "State Committee for the Defence and Implementation of the Constitution" has been formed, quickly taking over the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LIBERTYPLACE;An attempted coup d'etat conducted by five thousand members of the Crescent City White League has taken place in New Orleans. They tried overthrowing the republican governor, citing supposed electoral fraud. Masses of men lead by a committee chaired by Robert H. Marr gathered on Canal Street, demanding to speak to governor Henry Dibble. He refused, citing that the crowd was armed and dangerous. In response, D. B. Penn declared himself lieutenant-governor and called on state militia to assemble and "drive the usurpers from power". Members of the White League were organized into a new "Louisiana State Militia" lead by self-proclaimed general Frederick Nash Ogden and began patrolling the streets of New Orleans, taking control of city hall. Metropolitan Police with cavalry and artillery eventually arrived and ordered them to disperse, leading to a pitched battle in which the police broke and an artillery piece was captured. Federal Troops arrived soon after and utterly defeated the rebel militia, putting an end to the coup. At least 32 people died and the revolt was crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZURIPUTSCH;News has reached us that, incited by the appointment of the controversial German theologian David Strauss to the theological faculty of the University of Zürich, the rural conservative population has risen up against the liberal rule of the city of Zürich. Seeing the old religious order in danger, several thousand putschists lead by Bernhard Hirzel, a pastor of a small nearby town, stormed the city and entered combat with guards. Councillor Johannes Hegetschwiller attempted to act as a mediator between the city council and insurgents and was ruthlessly shot in the head, dying three days later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BUEAIRYELFEV;A yellow fever epidemic has broken out in Buenos Aires. Due to the lack of a drainage system and running water, the Aedes aegypti mosquito which is responsible for spreading Yellow Fever has proliferated in the city. This, combined with the unsanitary living conditions, has lead to the epidemic spreading like a wildfire. The price of medicine is through the roof. At this point, over 500 people are dying every day, although the rate has begun to drop due to thousands of people fleeing the city for the countryside. As the city only has 40 funeral carriages, coffins have begun piling up in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEXICOCITYFALLS;U.S. Army forces under General Winfield Scott have, after a series of pitched battles, captured Mexico City. The last stragglers of our retreating army have, despite some support from the populace, been wiped out. An American military governor has taken up residence in the national palace. For some, this great defeat is so humiliating that they see the war as all but lost. Others, however, view America striking at the very heart of Mexico, this unparalleled crime, as reason to fight on with even greater ferocity. Some regional governors who had previously withheld troops from the national army now recognize the urgency of our situation and have now offered their men for the struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAKOZDBATTLE;The first battle of our war of independence has taken place. A large invasion force lead by Croatian Ban Josip Jelacic was marching towards Pest when it encountered our forces under János Móga. Despite being outnumbered more than 2 to 1, the brave volunteer's fierce general assault overwhelmed the invaders' lines and sent them into a disorganized retreat. With Jelacic's failure to quickly end our revolution, the main Austrian army has now begun taking action. It seems that this initial victory is more of a calm before the storm. Nevertheless, our fearless men will fight to the last to defend their motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With our newfound strength, the time has finally come to join Ecuador and Peru once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUSVICRUS;In their recent victory against Prussia, the Austrians stripped the latter of its influence among the German principalities and much of its territories. While Austria is currently still weak and recovering from the war, its overall position in Europe has been significantly strengthened to the detriment of the Prussians. Austria's temporary weakness and the possibility of using the balance of power as a pretext present us with an opportunity to make demands on the Austrians. It has been proposed that we send them an ultimatum demanding the establishment of Russian sovereignty over Galicia-Lodomeria. While they may begrudgingly agree to this, their refusal would unavoidably lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

REFORMREV1836;Venezuela is currently embroiled in a vicious civil war. Its roots lie in the congressional presidential election of 1835 in which current President José María Vargas, a conservative, won with 51% of the congressmens' votes. Santiago Mariño Carige, a renowned liberal hero of the war of independence who received but 13% of the vote, began an insurrection in June of last year, aiming to restore Gran Colombia, institute federalism and depose the allegedly tyrannical conservatives. With broad support among the populace, the revolution quickly spread from Zulia to Carabobo, seizing the capital. Retired General José Antonio Páez, a hero of the war of independence, marched 190km from his home in San Pablo to Caracas, gathering men who joined his ranks along the way. The Reformists had already abandoned the city by the time he arrived. At present, his army is in the West, routing the remains of the Reformist army. It seems the conflict will soon come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANRIKUEARTHQUAKE;A soft rumbling begins to emerge under their feet. It grows louder and louder, as the ground shakes and swells. Yet the damage from the tremor pailed compared to the colossal waves striking the coast, tearing the scaffolding down from their wooden and paper houses, crushing them under their caved in roofs, drowning them in their living rooms and in the streets. \n\nAt 2:31 AM, an 8.4 magnitude earthquake ocurred east of Kamaishi, Iwate Prefecture, in the Tohoku region. Surprisingly, the quake itself did little damage, though the resulting tsunami would cause utter devastation in the aftermath. 7,000 homes along the northern Japanese coast were destroyed and washed away. The death toll stands now at 1,522. An additional 1,542 went missing and are presumed dead, and 12,053 people were injured. The town of Taro suffered the most--98% of residences destroyed and 42% of its people killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRPINIAEARTHQUAKE;An extremely destructive earthquake has struck the area around the southern Italian regions of Bascillata, Apulia, and Campania today at 1 AM. With the range of the first shock covering 6,300 square kilometers,  the area received aftershocks throughout the next 24 hours, laying waste to towns such as Aquilonia and Lacedonia. The earth's cataclysmic rumbling destroyed killed 1,000 people, injured up to 7,000 people, and destroyed roughly a hundred thousand homes. The locals celebrate the extremely low casualty rate compared to the overwhelmingly high rate of property damage--a twisted source of optimism as a hundred thousand families are left homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TANGOEARTHQUAKE;Disaster has struck within the northern Tango peninsula, where an earthquake of up to 7.3 magnitude rocked the towns across the peninsula and caused shocks to be felt as far away as Tokyo and Kagoshima. Damage was primarily concentrated within a 15-kilometer radius around the penisula, with most devastation occurring within Mineyama, Amino, Yosano, and Iwataki townships. These communities faced up to 90% of their residences destroyed or critically damaged. 2,895 are reported dead, and 7,806 are injured. Further damage was inflicted when housefires spread as cooking stoves' flames spread out of control, particularly in Amino township. Lastly, in Osaka's Tsurumachi district, seawater as well as freshwater from ruptured pipes emerged from cracks in the ground, causing houses to become submerged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NANTOUEARTHQUAKE;Nantou subprefecture, Taiwan, is experiencing a seemingly unending series of earthquakes, causing death and property destruction in each shock. The sparsely populated district is experiencing casualties beyond 10 in each tremor. Hundreds of homes continue lying in ruin, forcing the rural inhabitants into homelessness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PROVENCEEARTHQUAKE;A powerful earthquake struck a sizable area across southeastern France and northwestern Italy today, with its focal point in Provence. The quake devastated the towns within Bouches-du-Rhône, many along the hilltops of the Trévaresse. Casualties include 40 dead and 250 injured. Additionally, the shock was felt as far away as the departement of Gard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KINGSTONEARTHQUAKE;The Jamaican capital is reeling today from a catastrophic earthquake that left ruins across the entire city. With 1,000 reported dead, the city quickly succumbed to destruction as the tremor caused further damage through fires that spread throughout various buildings. Damage was also reported within Buff and Annoto Bay. A tsunami shortly afterward struck a swath of Jamaica's northern coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEISHANEARTHQUAKE;"Within Chiayi city, and a limited area around, 1,216 persons were suddenly thrust out into the eternal world. Not fewer than 2,306 persons were seriously injured, and 13,259 houses laid low. The great mysterious Power then tore the earth into deep, open chasms in several places." \n\nAt 6:43 AM, a sudden earthquake struck western Taiwan's Chiayi county. The tremor occurred at a focal depth of 6 kilometers, rocking the countryside and destroying all in its path. Meishan, a town in the county, was left entirely in rubble. The destruction of over 10,000 houses is owed to their materials' poor resistance to earthquakes, made predominantly of mud bricks. The quake also formed a 25 kilometer faultline along Chiayi county, now termed the Meishan fault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DOULIUEARTHQUAKE;A powerful tremor rocked southwestern Taiwan's Douliu and Xingang districts at 4:05 AM today. With the epicenter in Douliu, the earthquake caused 145 deaths, 500 houses' total destruction, and partial damage to an additional 1,085. The most fatalities were reported in Xingang, where a disproportionate 85 souls were claimed. Soil liquefaction was reported at several sites shortly thereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MANZIKERTEARTHQUAKE;Perhaps hell doesn't burn, but shake. The people of Manzikert-Patnos are reeling in from an apocalyptic earthquake that has destroyed much of the area--among the deadliest tremors in our nation's history. 3,500 people and 20,000 animals are reported dead. 12,000 homes have been upended by the earthquake. Damages have also occurred in nearby Erzurum and Bitlis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHEVIOTEARTHQUAKE;The New Zealand town of Cheviot, in the Canterbury region, was hit by an earthquake of considerable magnitude, though casualties are extraordinarily low. An infant was reported dead after a sod hut collapsed from the ground's shock. Beyond that, the Christchurch Cathedral was damaged slightly. Additionally, sand volcanoes were reported in Kaiapoi, outside the epicenter: water forced out of sand dunes due to seismic pressure, creating floods. This, in turn, caused soil liquefaction within an area 2 to 3 miles outside of Cheviot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PRIMASSASS;A terrible event has unfolded: Prime Minister Juan Prim has been tragically assassinated. The Death of Prim, a revered political figure and military leader, has cast a dark shadow over our nation, leaving us in deep mourning.

MORRALDESC;News has reached us of a tragic incident in Madrid involving a failed assassination attempt on our beloved monarch. As King Alfonso XIII and his bride, Victoria Eugenie, drove down a street in Madrid after their wedding, Mateu Morral, who commited suicide thereafter, threw a bomb at their carriage. They survived, however many civilians did not. This shocking act has ignited a wave of political turmoil and raised concerns about the growing threat of anarchism. We must navigate this challenging situation and formulate an appropriate response to safeguard stability, address social grievances, and protect our monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CARLOABDICATES;After the fiasco that was the war with Austria, our esteemed monarch, Carlo Alberto, has made the profound decision of abdicating in favor of Vittorio Emanuele II, his son. Though his generals tried to dissuade him, he replied: "My decision is the fruit of mature reflexion. From this moment, I am no longer the kin: The king is Victor, my son." He is now in exile in Portugal, never to return to Italy. We shall never forget his unwavering service to our great nation and how he withstood the trials and tribulations he faced. The relentless battles, the weight of strategic decisions, and the inevitable setbacks surely weigh heavily on our former monarch's shoulders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MITOREBELLION;A revolt has broken out in the Mito Domain, where rebels have begun taking terrorist actions against the central power of the Shogunate in favor of Emperor Komei and greater regional autonomy. The Sonno Joi movement caused by the Emperor's order of 'revere the emperor and expel the barbarians' is the driving force behind the uprising, for the shogunal decision to open the port of Yokohama to foreign shipping in defiance of the Emperor's order has enraged the imperial loyalists, sparking the revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BISMARCKDEATH;Otto von Bismarck, the legendary statesman who played a pivotal role in the consolidation of Germany, has passed away today at the age of 83. As the news of his passing has spread, the German people have felt a deep loss, reflecting on Bismarck's unparalleled contributions to our nation's growth and prosperity. Distraught after the death of his wife in 1894, Bismarck was forced to use a wheelchair in his last years and suffered from gangrene which ultimately killed him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VITTORIODEATH;Somber news of the passing of king Vittorio Emanuele II is echoing through the land. After hunting in the marshy areas of Lazio, his excellency succumbed to malarial fevers at the age of 57 after having ruled for 28 years. This monumental event leaves our people with heavy hearts, as we reflect on the remarkable our former ruler's great accomplishments. He will surely be missed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KINMONINCIDENT;A rebellion against the Shogun has taken place near the Kyoto Imperial Palace! The Hamaguri Gate, once a symbol of authority and stability, was attacked by ronin, landless samurai from the neighboring Choshu domain. The rebels sought to capture the emperor and restore the Imperial household to its position of political supremacy in opposition to the shogun. Thankfully, the palace guards held off the rebels, numbered at three thousand, until sufficient reinforcements arrived to make quick work of them. This was nonetheless a close call and shows the significant threat Emperor Komei poses to the shogun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAOSUPRISING;Pueblo and Hispano peasants in the area of Taos, North of Santa Fe, have risen up against our occupation. Northern New Mexico was already lawless under Mexican administration, with a revolt against its governor occurring in 1837. With anti-American sentiments in the area running high, Pablo Montoya, the leader of the 1837 revolt, has organized militia to engage our occupation forces. Though they succeeded in killing provisional governor Charles Bent and several other occupation officials, the rebels are now in the process of being routed by forces lead from Santa Fe by Colonel Sterling Price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PASTRYWAR;The grievances of a respected French baker residing in Mexico City, whose establishment was reportedly violated by Mexican authorities, have stirred up interventionist fervor in our nation. Sympathetic members of our government have called for action to be taken to ensure justice is served. Indeed, this affront to a French citizen offers us a unique opportunity to seek reparations for the damages suffered and assert our nation's honor. However, should Mexico refuse to comply, we will be under pressure to take military action, lest our demands be seen as an empty threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DOGGERBANK;News has reached us that our fleet made an embarassing blunder while crossing through the choppy waters of the Dogger Bank. Our warships mistook British fishing boats for enemy torpedo boats, firing at them and killing several British fishermen. This incident has caused severe diplomatic strain with Britain, with some Brits already calling for retaliation. We face a diplomatic crossroads: We can either apologize and de-escalate the situation, avoiding a potential conflict, or refuse to apologize and risk plunging our nation into a war with the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHERMANINCIDENT;Startling news has reached us from the far-away nation of Korea. A merchant ship thought lost at sea, the USS Sherman, arrived in Korea in 1867 without government approval in an attempt to a enforce a trade treaty. Despite being told to turn back, the Sherman sailed up the Taedong river to Pyongyang, where the Koreans attempted to sink the Sherman with weak cannons that had no effect on the ships's hull. Only the use of several fire ships finally sank the Sherman, leaving no survivors. Many demand that this brazen act of aggression against our citizens must be answered with the full might of our navy. We must decide whether to accept being humiliated by an Asian kingdom or to send our navy across the Pacific for a punitive expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHILEANREV1851;Inspired by the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, the liberals have launched a revolution against the conservative-dominated government. Liberal leader José María de la Cruz has claimed that the results of the last election were falsified in favor of conservative president Manuel Francisco Julián Montt. Commanders of garrisons in multiple towns have disavowed Montt, pledging themselves to the liberal cause and taking over cities. With our nation divided and conflict inevitable, we can only hope that Chile will be whole again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While we have little interest in such ethnonationalist pretenses, the Balkans have long been a region of great interest and importance to the Habsburg realm. By tying the Habsburg province of Serbia to their own irredentist concept of Yugoslavism, we may provide ourselves a useful justification for annexing a great deal of Turkish territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Austrian Netherlands were a territory of the Austrian Empire following the Spanish war of succession, and an old territory of the defunct Holy Roman Empire. In the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, the territory was awarded to the Netherlands in the hopes of establishing a buffer state against any attempts at renewed French expansionism. In this modern industrial age, however, the Hollanders have proven far from capable of providing a proper power balance against either France or the German realms. By reinstituting Austrian control of these strategically vital provinces, the Habsburg realm may provide itself with important industrial complexes, economic resources, and a position from which it can provide a check to French and Prussian ambitions. The rest of Europe may not look kindly on this rationale, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding 'Count of Habsburg' to his title. In 1273, Count Radbot's seventh-generation descendant, Rudolph of Habsburg, was elected Holy Roman Emperor. Our lands of the western Alps were robbed from us in the Swabian War of 1499 in which the Swiss Confederation seized our homeland.

It would therefore be best to bring the principalities into the Habsburg fold. Western Wallachia was in fact once part of the Habsburg domains as the Banat of Craiova from 1718 to 1739.

Other territories in the region were acquired by the marriage of Maximilian I of Habsburg to Mary of Burgundy. Franche-Comté was lost to France with the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678 after the Franco-Dutch War. Still, these areas are rightfully Habsburg lands by virtue of inheritance and were unlawfully appropriated by the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reclaim_white_nile_desc;In the years of decline for the Shilluk kingdom, its hold over the south grew increasingly contested by other rival tribes seeking to control the lucrative trade down its banks.

Where once their great tombs lied, now shall our thrones rise in their stead!

EVTNAME00102;Shilluk Warbands take Khartoum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00102;Over the early 1800s, much Egyptian expansion has been focused on pushing deep into the Sudan, dethroning the traditional powers in the region and establishing effective Egyptian colonial rule across the Nile. One of these powers, and for a time perhaps the greatest, was the Shilluk. While beaten down and presumed permanently broken in recent years, the Shilluk have daringly crossed downstream and seized Khartoum in the midst of our conflict with the Ottoman Turks. We can seldom afford a war with the diminished Shilluk at this delicate time, but we may be find them much stronger should we attempt to crush them later, or we may well find ourselves incapable of pushing the issue altogether. How must we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00102;We can do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00104;Shilluk Warbands claim the Sudan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00104;Despite our best efforts to stem Shilluk raids, it has come to pass that the barbarians in the south have claimed for their own the whole of the Sudan. Our rule loose and threatened by rebellion already, it is once again up to us whether we simply accept their ownership of yet more land in our domain, or fight the upstarts for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00105;Germanization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00105;Germanization is the process whereby various slavic and eastern peoples are subjected to assimilation and conversion policies in order to integrate them into a Germanic national identity. While the Austrian empire is known for being multilingual and generally more lenient in this manner than the rest of Germany, it still engaged in policies aimed at seeding German populations across its empire. Time has yet to show whether these policies will be expanded further to facilitate assimilation or whether they will be abandoned in favor of a truly multinational union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00105;We will assimilate them eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00106;The Rise of Bach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00106;In the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolution, and the fall of Metternich from Austrian favor, the new influential figure in Austrian politics became that of Alexander von Bach. A 'wonderfully unprincipled man,' he was known for completely changing his views and positions on various issues based entirely on what benefitted the Austrian empire and his own position the most. A man who endorsed heavy-handed centralization, he is a force that will, should his ultimate programs succeed, unite the empire by force. \n\n§RIf Germany or Italy unify, Bach will be removed.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00106;A truly useful individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00107;The Death of Bach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00107;After a long and illustrious career as an influential part of Austrian politics, Alexander Freiherr von Bach has died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00107;He was a truly illustrious politician.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00108;The Decline of Bach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00108;While Bach's influence in the Austrian state has been unparalleled for some years, recent failures in the Austrian military or foreign policy have placed the empire's status in Europe under threat, leaving Bach, the architect of Austrian internal affairs, as the logical scapegoat. While he may not necessarily lose his position, his influence will never quite define Austrian affairs ever again after this humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00108;A shame. He showed such promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00109;A Standing Army of Soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00109;Alexander Freiherr von Bach is well-known for his highly conservative policies, one such being that of greatly expanding the Austrian standing army, in direct neglect of industrial expansion. Should this policy be continued or expanded?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00109;We shall explore his reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00109;We will not be forgoing industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00110;A Fawning Army of Sneaks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00110;Another policy of Bachs has been one of greatly expanding the intelligentsia, censoring the press and covertly arresting political opponents. While this is highly unpopular, it does greatly reduce the organization of our political opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00111;The Centralization Process - Dismantling Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00111;While the Austrian Empire has a long way to go in bringing about truly centralized control over the realm, the first and most glaring issue remains the first and most important to resolve, that of the Hungarian crown. The Hungarian crown is the largest and most troublesome of the Habsburg domains, a long history of rebellions and disloyalty accompanying its shared history with the crown of Austria. While attempts have been made to curb its substantial autonomy within the empire in order to solidify Austrian rule, there have been none as comprehensive as the campaign it is about to undergo. The full dismantling of Hungary is underway, and only should it be successful can the Austrian empire become an empire in the truest sense, united in purpose and identity under the Habsburg crowns. While Hungary may protest, the government is confident it can put down any attempted rebellion that may soon come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00111;The Hungarian Crown belongs to Austria, and not the other way around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00112;The Second Hungarian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00112;The response to the Austrian reforms has been remarkably predictable, all things considered. In the interlude to a rebellion, a new Hungarian diet has been illegally convened in Budapest, declaring itself the sole legal authority over the Hungarian crown, and rejecting the Habsburgs as illegitimate pretenders to the nation. With their declaration, and the defecting of many hungarian soldiers and citizens to their cause, the second Hungarian revolution has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00112;We will put this rebellion down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00113;The Hungarian Revolution - Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00113;How predictably, the Hungarian rebels have once again fallen to the might of the Austrian Empire. With this victory, the crown of Hungary has finally been dissolved and fully integrated into the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00113;The Hungarian Crown is dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00114;Centralization Program - Finishing Touches;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00114;With the Hungarians dealt with, the rest of the empire can be integrated as is necessary to ensure Austrian hegemony is secured henceforth. Other provinces of the Empire have been strengthened and expanded, Hungarian, Serbian, and other forms of leadership deemed untrustworthy being replaced with more loyal Germanic or Polish authorities, in order to ensure continued Habsburg rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207074;A British force has crossed the Niagara River to board and sink a US steamer, the Caroline, where it was moored at Schlosser's Landing in U.S. territory. Shots were exchanged and an American watchmaker was killed, before the force set fire to the Caroline and set it adrift in the Niagara River, about two miles above Niagara Falls. William Lyon Mackenzie, the leader of the Upper Canada Rebellion, a revolt bringing chaos to Canada, had recruited hundreds of Americans who were encamped on Navy Island on the Canadian side of the Niagara River. They had been brought there by the Caroline, leading the British to destroy it in a raid. This violation of American sovereignty has caused outrage among the American people. Many inhabitants of towns bordering Canada are demanding the U.S. government declare war on Britain or at least demand compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207078;British minister to the United States, Lord Ashburton, has refused to apologize for the recent violation of American territorial sovereignty. The leader of the militia responsible for the incursion, Canadian colonel Allan MacNab, has even been granted a knighthood. This infuriating offense has lead many American politicians to the conclusion that perfidious Albion has crossed a line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207079;In response to our refusal to pay compensation for the recent incursion into US territory, the American government has backed down. With America in recession due to the Panic of 1837, the US is in too much turmoil to commit to a war against our mighty navy and skilled army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207081;In response to our refusal to pay compensation for the recent incursion into US territory, the American government has declared war.

CHESSTRIUMPOVERGERMANY;Curt von Bardeleben, a man known to be one of the best chess players of our time, started playing chess at the age of ten and quickly grew to be a force to be reckoned with. He stopped law school for a while to improve his chess skills. However, his skills have failed to save him from William Steinitz. While Curt held his line and kept his composure until the midgame, he would eventually lose his pawns one by one after a crucial mistake. Instead of conceding the win to his opponent, he simply stood up and left the game. He later explained that he was disturbed by the applause of the spectators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187751DESC;The deadliest hurricane in the history of Cuba has passed over the province of Camagüey. The cyclone had a path through the Caribbean Sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the Atlantic hurricane season. 2870 People have died in the town of Santa Cruz del Sur due to the storm's six and a half meter storm surge that obliterated the settlement. A further 163 people have died across Cuba due to the storm's strong winds, storm surges, and rain devastating extensive portions of central and eastern Cuba. Material damages are estimated to be about 40 million dollars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187752DESC;An immensely destructive hurricane has struck eastern Hispaniola. Making landfall near Santo Domingo with winds estimated at 155 miles per hour, it had passed 60 miles southwest of Puerto Rico. A gust of 180 miles per hour was recorded by a Pan-American Airways anemometer located in Santo Domingo before it was blown away. The storm has left a path of destruction about 20 miles wide, levelling three entire districts of the city. Somewhere between two and eight thousand people have died. Thankfully, The mountains of the interior have rapidly weakened the hurricane, decreasing the winds to tropical storm status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187753DESC;Louisiana has been hit by the deadliest hurricane in the history of the state and our nation. The hurricane made landfall on southeastern Louisiana near Chenière Caminada at peak strength, with 130 mile per hour winds driving a massive storm surge that killed an estimated 2000 people. The swath of coastal damage spans 500 miles, extending from Louisiana's Timbalier Bay eastward to Pensacola, Florida. The area of southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans and Port Eads suffered the most damage, including complete destruction of property and much of the area's crops such as orange, sugar, and rice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187754DESC;A devastating hurricane has caused severe damage in Florida. Strong winds struck southern Florida as the hurricane moved ashore, with three unofficial reports of 100 miles per hour. The hurricane has left thousands of people homeless in Florida. Property damage is estimated at $25 million. In addition to the human fatalities, 1278 livestock and 47389 poultry were killed, respectively. Approximately 6% of oranges and 18% of grapefruit are ruined, respectively. Across Florida, 32 thousand households have been left without telephone service as 400 poles are broken and about 2500 others are leaning due damage caused by the strong winds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT187755DESC;Western Cuba has been impacted by a powerful hurricane. High winds and torrential rainfall have flooded streets, destroyed crops, and damaged plantations. In particular, the storm has caused substantial damage to the tobacco in the region of Vuelta Abajo. Many towns are also severely damaged or destroyed. The city of Casilda is devastated, while the town of Batabanó has been inundated by flood waters. Thousands of peasants have been left homeless due to the cyclone. Losses in Havana are also extensive. Along the shore, scores of ships carrying valuable cargo have sunk while goods stored on local wharves and barges have been damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LANGUEDOCREVOLT;Unrest of massive proportions has erupted in the Languedoc-Rousillon wine region. Amid crop failure in 1902 and 1903, the government allowed the chaptalization of wine, which is the addition of sugar before fermentation to increase alcohol content and overall volume of wine. This, combined with growing imports from Algeria, Italy and Spain as well as good harvests, has caused a huge overproduction of wine, reducing its value by 7 francs per hundred liters. Angry impoverished vintners have taken to the streets, forming massive protests of 100,000 in Narbonne, 150,000 in Béziers, 200,000 in Perpignan, 250,000 in Carcassone, 300,000 in Nîmes and 800,000 in Montpellier. A vote of no confidence against the president has been launched as the military is being dispatched to restore order to the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHAMPAGNERIOTS;Riots have broken out in the Aube valley wine region. The vintners are upset that the newly issued 'Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée', a law regulating the usage of the word 'Champagne' that requires grapes used in the fluid to have been grown in the Marne valley wine region. The vintners of the Aube, however, also consider themselves as living in the Champagne and are extremely upset at their exclusion, especially considering recent crop failures. Likewise, the vintners of the Marne are upset that the inclusion of the Aube is even being considered, as they view the region as 'foreign' and incapable of producing true Champagne. This has lead to widespread riots in the Aube in which many homes have been ransacked and pillaged. 40 thousand troops have been called in to restore order to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ROSSEXPEDITION;John Ross has returned from his Second Arctic Expedition to discover the Northwest Passage financed by gin magnate Felix Booth for which he had left in 1829 in his ship, the Victory, a side-wheel steamer with paddles that can be lifted away from the ice. The expedition reached the Gulf of Boothia where no European had ever sailed before. There, the ship became entrapped in the ice for two years before being abandoned. In that time, James Clark Ross, an officer aboard the ship, made several journeys across the ice, becoming the first European to reach the Magnetic North Pole. On their return trip, the expedition trekked across the ice to open water. There, they were rescued by the whaler Isabella that returned them to England. John Rosss has been knighted by the Queen for this feat of heroic proportions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATDISRUPTION;The Church of Scotland has always claimed an inherent right to exercise independent spiritual jurisdiction over its own affairs. The right of patronage, however, in which the patron of aparish has the right to install a minister of his choice, has become apoint of contention. Many church members believe that this right infringes on the spiritual independence of the church. Others feel that this right is a property of the state. This conflict, simmering since the early 1700s, has resulted in a schism in which the new Free Church of Scotland has been formed. In a special meeting in St Andrew's Church in Edinburgh, the Disruption Assembly, 474 of about 1,200 ministers of the Church of Scotland declared their departure from the church. They must now finance and organize their new church from scratch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PUNTIHAKKA;An extremely bloody conflict has broken out in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong. During the Red Turban Rebellion in Canton, the Hakka people had helped the imperial army raid Punti villages to kill the rebels and any real or suspected sympathisers, including villagers who had been forced to pay taxes to the Red Turbans. That has precipitated open hostility between the Hakka and the Punti, with the Punti attacking Hakka villages in revenge. Battles rage in which both sides fortify their villages with walls, destroy bridges and roads, and raise armies as best they can. Entire villages are involved in the fighting, with all able-bodied men called to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEATRIOTS;Violent riots have taken place in Santiago de Chile. The reason that motivated the populace to rise up is the recent introduction of tariffs against Argentinean beef introduced by the current protectionist government to combat the devaluation of Chilean beef by increasingly cheap imports from Argentina. This measure has proven extremely unpopular among the people, as the price of beef has risen significantly, making it too expensive for those in poverty, leading to the formation of 'La Comité Central de Abolición del Impuesto al Ganado' or the Central Committee for the Abolishment of the Livestock Tariff. Over fifty thousand people assembled to protest against the tariff. While many remained non-violent, others began looting stores and attacking government buildings, causing to bloody clashes with police in which 230 protestors and 20 policemen died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ITALIANMASSACRE;A massacre has taken place in the town of Aigues-Mortes, located in the Camargue. Unemployed French workers got into a brawl with low-wage Italian immigrant laborers working for the 'Compagnie des Salins du Midi' where they harvested seasalt from evaporation ponds. Despite an attempt at intervention by the gendarmes, a mob of angry locals massacred Italian workers, beating them with clubs, shooting them with rifles and drowning them in the sea. Nine deaths have been confirmed, but estimates range up to several dozen. No convictions have been made. In response, rioters in Rome smashed the windows of the French embassy and trams owned by a French company were set on fire in Genoa and Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PILTDOWNMAN;Bone fragments of a previously unknown early human have been found! Though there are some doubts about their authenticity, the remains are broadly accepted as belonging to an extinct species of hominid, the 'Eoanthropus dawsoni', named after the famed discoverer of the remains, paleoanthropologist Charles Dawson. He made the initial find in Pleistocene gravel beds near Piltdown, East Sussex. He and Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum, excavated the area, unearthing more bones and artifacts, including skull fragments, a set of teeth, a jawbone and primitive tools connected to the same individual. Woodward has reconstructed the skull fragments and hypothesizes that they are 500,000 years old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SELKNAMGENOCIDE;Following the gold rush in Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, economic development of the island has begun picking up speed. With gold slowly drying up, settlers have begun taking up lucrative cattle ranching. The local natives, named the Selk'nam, are perceived by the ranchers as a major obstacle to the success of their investments. They have therefore begun hiring professional hunters to systematically exterminate them. The shareholders of 'Sociedad Explotadora de Tierra de Fuego', the 'Company for the Exploitation of Tierra de Fuego', are strategically hiding details of this genocide from the public to ensure that human rights don't get in the way of their profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FLOURRIOT;After two successive years of wheat crop failures and an inflationary boom fueled by foreign investment, commodity prices in New York have begun to skyrocket over the Winter. This has lead radical extremists, the Locofocos, to stage violent riots in the city, plundering private storerooms filled with sacks of hoarded flour. Crowds assaulted warehouses, broke down doors and windows and rolled barrels of flour into the streets. Police and the national guard arrived soon after, dispersing the crowd but failing to prevent large-scale theft. 500-600 barrels of flour and 1000 bushels of wheat have been stolen or destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VERSAILLESACCIDENT;The deadliest train accident in world history has occured in the cutting between Meudon and Bellevue stations on the railway between Versailles and Paris. The train was travelling to Paris when it derailed after the leading locomotive broke an axle, and the carriages behind piled into it and caught fire. Deaths are estimated to be between 52 and 200 as the fire was so intense that the number of fatalities cannot be determined. The victims could not escape the wreckage because they were locked in their compartments as is custom. Hundreds more have been seriously injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BANKWAR;The issue of rechartering the Bank of the United States or B.U.S. has taken center-stage in the ongoing electoral campaign. Incumbent president Andrew Jackson has denounced the Bank as a 'moneyed tribunal' and is arguing for 'a hard money policy against a paper money policy'. Conversely, the National Republicans under Senator Henry Clay have introduced recharter bills in both the House and the Senate that both passed with a majority. In response, Andrew Jackson has vetoed the bills, an unprecedented violation of the legislative authority of Congress. Jackson argues that the president, when acting in the interests of the American people, isn't bound to the decisions of the Supreme Court, nor to forced to comply with legislation passed by Congress. This extremely controversial move has lead the National Republicans to accuse Jackson of violating the constitution, comparing him to absolute monarchs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PATENTOFFICEFIRE;Patent documents amounting to the past fifty years of American inventions have gone up in flames. All 9957 patents and 7000 patent-related models have been lost. The disaster was caused by a fire in the Patent Office, where employees stored firewood and hot ashes precariously near one another. When the building began to burn, the 16 year-old fire hose purchased by congress was too leaky to function and a bucket brigade proved ineffective. This calamitous incident has tragically set back American research, as many inventions recorded in the patents have been  entirely lost to time. The construction of a new fire-proof patent office has already begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANDIJANUPRISING;A nationalist rebellion has occured in the town of Andijan, located in the former Khanate of Kokand. Around 1500 men surrounded our forces' camp located there, taking them by complete surprise. Thankfully, our skilled troops regrouped quickly and routed the rebels, ending the revolt in only 15 minutes. Twenty-two soldiers have died and sixteen are wounded. Of the attackers, eighteen have been executed, including the leader, Muhammad Ali Madali, who had been declared khan the day before. The rest were arrested and condemned to forced labor or exile to Siberia. Most of the rebels were Kyrgyz muslims infuriated by the Russian non-compliance with sharia law, the ban on pilgrimages to Mecca and the abolition of zakat or religious tax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PAISASSASSINATION;President Sidónio Bernardino Cardoso da Silva Pais is dead. In the Lisboa-Rossio Railway Station, as the president passed the assassin, left-wing activist José Júlio da Costa, the latter penetrated the double police cordon that surrounded the former and fired two shots from the pistol hidden under his cloak. Pais was an extremely controversial president. While he is immensely popular among the general population for undoing the separation of church and state and re-establishing diplomatic relations with the Vatican, his unconstitutional actions were despised by the liberals. Whether or not it was his intention, Pais has left a permanent mark on Portugal that has damaged democracy and reduced governmental stability. His last words were:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOBRIKOVASSASSINATION;Nikolay Ivanovich Bobrikov, Governor-General of Finland and the Finnish Military District since 1898, has been assassinated. He became extremely unpopular due to the centralization measures recently imposed on Finland leading to its loss of autonomy. He also instituted measures meant to russify Finland, such as requiring that all correspondence between government offices be conducted in Russian and that education in the Russian language was to be increased in schools. Bobrikov was shot three times by Eugen Schauman, a Finnish nationalist born in Kharkov who committed suicide immediately thereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SILENTPARADE;10,000 African Americans have conducted a silent march along Fifth Avenue in New York City. The event was organized by the NAACP as well as church and community leaders to protest violence directed towards African Americans, such as recent lynchings in Waco and Memphis. The parade was precipitated by the East St Louis riots, in which at least 40 black people were brutally murdered by white mobs. The silent march hoped to promote anti-lynching legislation and counter the dehumanization of African Americans. The parade marks the first large black-only protest in New York.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CODEXSINAITICUS;A fascinating discovery has been made in Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. Constantin von Tischendorf, a German Biblical scholar under the patronage of the Tsar, has returned from a trip to the remote monastery with the oldest known complete copy of the New Testament. It is a historical treasure, and using the study of comparative writing styles, it has been dated to the mid-fourth century. The manuscript is a codex made from vellum parchment, originally in double sheets, which may have measured about 40 by 70 centimeters. The whole codex consists of quires of eight leaves, a format which came to be popular throughout the Middle Ages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

buy_nicobar_islands_desc;The Nicobar Islands are an island chain south of the Andamans that remain under foreign rule. Since they are so small, their owner may not want to waste money and men on a war over them. What if we approached them with a handsome cash offer to take the islands off their hands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VIEDMAFLOOD;Disaster has struck along the Patagonian Río Negro. After a period of brutally intense rainfall which is completely unprecedented for the usually dry region, the river swelled far past its usual banks and engulfed General Roca, Fuerte san Javier, Fuerte Pringles, General Conesa and Viedma, where the water only receded three days later. The afflicted settlements have sustained massive damage. As such, large portions will have to be reconstructed to become inhabitable once more, though they will surely never be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MUSIFLOOD;The city of Hyderabad, capital of the Hyderabad State, has been devastated by a brutal flood, locally known as Thughyani Sitambar. The disaster has left fifty thousand people dead and washed away three bridges, leaving only one bridge to connect the two sides of the city. The river rose 60 feet, flowing through the city and razing eighty thousand houses, leaving a fourth of the population homeless. Popular Urdu poet Amjad Hyderabadi, saw his entire family, including his mother, wife and daughter washed away in the flood, ending up as the only survivor in his family. To reflect his depression at the loss, he has composed a couplet:;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BARRIOSASSASSINATION;José María Reina Barrios, also known as Reinita, has been assassinated. By a very strange coincidence, it was on February 8th, 1898 at No. 8 on 8th Street in Guatemala City at 8 PM local time that the president was shot by Edgar Zollinger, a British citizen and adminstrator of the Aparicio Family business, who was thereupon shot eight times by guards. Zollinger's motive is that Barrios had had Juan Aparicio, the former Mayor of Quetzaltenango, killed extrajudicially to illegally seize his assets, including the Zunil Electrical Plant, the Los Altos Railroad, Coffee Plantations and Local Bank, leaving the Aparicio family in ruins. Rainita will be remembered most of all for his improvements to Guatemalan infrastructure, such as bringing electricity to Guatemala City, constructing a transoceanic railroad, installing national and international telegraphs and improving the roads. To fund these ambitious plans, Barrios printed bonds, fuelling inflation and making himself unpopular among the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BROWNASSASSINATION;John Brown, one of the fathers of the Canadian Confederation, has been assassinated. Brown was a British-Canadian journalist and noted Reform politician, best known as the founder and editor of the Toronto Globe, Canada's most influential newspaper. He lead the founding the the Liberal Party and played a major role in securing national unity in Canada. The perpetrator of Brown's killing was a former employee of the Toronto Globe, George Bennet, who burst into Brown's office after being fired and wanted a certificate to show that he had worked for the paper for five years. Brown didn't recognize him and told him to talk to the foreman, leading Bennet to shoot Brown in the leg. Bennet was arrested and Brown retired to his home to recover from the would which was deemed minor. Tragically, the leg became infected, he obtained a fever and delirium and eventually died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BORDAASSASSINATION;President Juan Bautista Idiarte Borda y Soumastre has been assassinated! A member of the Colorado Party, Idiarte's presidency was beset by a number of severe difficulties which found their origins in a host of commercial, ideological and personal issues. His term of office was also characterized by a program of public works, including the development of the port of Montevideo and the establishment of a national bank. Idiarte was shot by Avelino Arredondo with a revolver. Despite having been warned of an assassination plot on the part of his party enemies, and even though the assassin is a known strong supporter of his rival José Batlle y Ordóñez, the latter has maintained a plausible deniability in connection with the crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ERITHEXPLOSION;Early in the morning a blast was heard all over London. A gunpowder barge moored near Erith, Kent had ignited, setting off two landward powder magazines: the resulting chain explosion consumed 46.5 tons of gunpowder and blew the river wall into the Thames. Fortunately it was low tide, but Lewis Moore, an engineer who chanced to live nearby, realised the gap must be plugged before the tide rose. Moore has stated: 'The extent of land positively imperilled would be about 4,000 acres, and should it have passed Woolwich and Greenwich by the large sewer, it might have done immense damage. The whole of the southern and eastern side of London being more or less below the level of high water.' Navvies building Crossness Pumping Station and the garrison at the Woolwich Arsenal raced to the site of the explosion and worked against the clock to repair the damage. They improvised puddled clay and earth-filled artillery sandbags to fill the gap, saving London in the nick of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EGGWAR;The Farallon Islands, 25 miles off San Francisco, have long been home to egging companies, as they are the site of the largest seabird colony of the Pacific coast of North America, leading to an abundance of fresh eggs. In 1849, Dr Robinson, a recent immigrant to San Francisco, sailed to the island to collect eggs and subsequently founded the Pacific Egg Company, constructing buildings, paths and landing facilities on the Farallones. The Egg Company attracted rivals, due to the amount of money to be made from the trade. A company of men led by David Batchelder repeatedly sailed to the island but was removed by armed men employed by the Egg Company. The two forces finally came to blows when Batchelder obtained reinforcements and tried forcefully landing on the guarded island, leading to an exchange of fire that lasted 20 minutes. Two men were killed and four wounded, forcing Batchelder to retreat and securing the Egg Company monopoly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KALEVIPOEG;In pre-Christian ancient Estonia there existed an oral tradition, known as runic song, of legends explaining the origin of the world. Within old Estonian folklore, a benevolent giant by the name of Kalev appears, battling with other giants or enemies of the nation. Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald has collected oral stories based on the tale of Kalevipoeg, Kalev's son, and woven them into an epic poem of nineteen thousand verses that reconstructs the tale. It has appeared in print in Kuopio Finland in its third, abridged version. Earlier versions were not printable due to censorship. The publication now makes Estonian oral tradition available to all, strengthening national identity as a result. More importantly, it has ensured that the tale of Kalevipoeg is recorded for generations to come and not lost to time like so many other ancient oral traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PANTADEUSZ;Polish poet, writer,translator and philosopher Adam Mickiewicz has written an epic poem titled 'Pan Tadeusz' that has been published by Aleksander Jelowicki in Paris. The full English name is 'Sir Thaddeus, or the Last Foray inLithuania: A Nobility's Tale of the Years 18111812, in Twelve Books of Verse'. The story takes place over the course of five days in 1811 and two days in 1812, during the joint occupation of Poland by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The poem is set in the village of Soplicowo, the country estate of the Soplica clan in the Russian partition. Pan Tadeusz recounts the story of two feuding noble families, and the love between Tadeusz Soplica (the title character) of one family, and Zosia of the other. A subplot involves a spontaneous revolt of the local inhabitants against the occupying Russian garrison. Mickiewicz, an inhabitant of Paris and thus beyond the reach of Russia, writes openly about the occupation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOCHNESS;Legends about a monster in the Scottish lake Loch Ness have abounded since the year 565, when an Irish monk, Saint Columba, wrote of a man being killed by a water beast. Now, the legend has regained prominence with the publication of a photo purported to show the monster having been published in the Daily Mail. It shows a small head and back rising from the water surrounded by ripples in the Loch. While some cast doubt on the picture, dismissing it as driftwood, an elephant, an otter or a bird, the picture is widely considered as evidence for the existence of the monster, dubbed 'Nessie'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
URUGUAYANTHEM;Though Uruguay received an anthem in the form of lyrics by poet Francisco Acuña de Figueroa, it has always lacked official music. Several proposed musical settings have failed to gain public support until now. Hungarian-born composer Francisco José Debali, has, with assistance from Fernando Quijano, an actor and musician, composed the definitive version of Uruguay's anthem. The composition is inspired by operas of Gioachino Rossini's that are popular in Montevideo theaters. The Uruguayan anthem is now the longest anthem internationally at 105 bars of music, lasting about five to six minutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COSTARICAANTHEM;Costa Rica and its people have recently realized that they have heretofore lacked a national anthem to represent themselves outward on the international stage. To solve this predicament, composer Manuel María Gutiérrez Flores has collaborated with French adventurer Gabriel-Pierre Lafond de Lurcy to create a national anthem for the country. The anthem was played in public for the first time by the Banda de San José. It is, at this point, purely instrumental and lacks lyrics. It will, nonetheless, shape the future of Costa Rica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GUATEMALAANTHEM;Guatemala has long lacked a national anthem, though efforts have been made by, among others, the El Porvenir Literary Society to create one. Now, a competition has been organized. The winner is Rafael Álvarez Ovalle who unanimously won the jury's approval, much to the chagrin of the other competitors. Lyrics to the music have been written, yet their author remains a mystery. The premiere of the anthem has taken place in the literary lyrical act held at the Colón Theatre amid much celebration in a victory for Guatemalan culture and heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPANANTHEM;Kimigayo or 'His Imperial Majesty's Reign' is an ancient waka poem of the Heian period created by an unknown author. When visiting in 1869, John William Fenton, a Irish military band leader, realized that there was no national anthem in Japan. He spoke to Iwao Oyama, an officer of the Satsuma Clan, who selected Kimigayo as lyrics for him to use as base for an anthem. Fenton debuted his proposal for the anthem before the Emperor in 1870 but it was discarded because it 'lacked solemnity'. In 1880, the Ministry of the Imperial Household adopted a new melody composed by Yoshiisa Oku and Akimori Hayashi. This was still not fully satisfactory and carried Fenton's influence. Now, German musician Franz Eckert has applied the melody with Western style harmony, creating the definitive version of Kimigayo that has been officially adopted as national anthem and will be used forevermore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HAITIANTHEM;Haiti, despite being the first country of the new world to gain its independence from European colonizers, has never had an anthem. This is why, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Haitian Revolution, a competition has been held for a national anthem. The poetic words of Justin Lhérisson and martial composition of Nicolas Geffrard won over the judges, who preferred it to 'L'Artibonitienne' by Capois diplomat Louis Edouard Pouget. The anthem has, in an event organized by the Association du Petit Théâtre, premiered at the entry into Port-au-Prince. It was sung by Auguste de Pradines, also known as Kandjo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CUBAANTHEM;With Cuba finally having gained its independence, the time has come to adopt an official national anthem and La Bayamesa has been chosen. 'El Himno de Bayamo' is a song composed by Perucho Figueredo during the Battle of Bayamo against the Spanish oppressors. After their capitulation, the jubilant people surrounded Figueredo and asked him to write an anthem with the melody they were humming. Right on the saddle of his horse, Figueredo wrote the lyrics of the anthem. He was captured and executed by the Spanish two years later. Just before the firing squad received the command, Figueredo shouted the line from his song: 'Morir por la Patria es vivir!';;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREEKANTHEM;Dionysius Solomos wrote 'Hymn to Liberty' or 'Hymn to Freedom' in 1823 in Zakynthos, and one year later it was printed in Messolonghi. Now, over two decades thereafter, the Corfiot composer Nikolaos Chalikiopoulos Mantzaros has composed two choral versions, a long one for the whole poem and a short one for the first two stanzas. The latter has become the Greek national anthem. The long version is the longest anthem internationally by number of words and describes the struggle for Greek independence, the execution of Patriarch Gregory V, the reaction of the Great Powers, the Siege of Tripolitsa and other events of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HENRYDEATH;President William Henry Harrison has passed away. He was born a son of founding father Benjamin Harrison in 1773 and entered the army at age 18. He went on to serve in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers in the Northwest Indian War and lead troops against Tecumseh'sconfederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. He was promoted to major general in the Army during the War of 1812, leading America to victory at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada. In the presidential election of 1840, he became the Whig candidate and faced off against the Democratic Martin Van Buren who had become very unpopular due to the economic depression following the Panic of 1837. Harrison won in a landslide: 234 electoral votes to Van Buren's 60. Tragically, despite having been administered bloodletting and opium by his doctor, he has died only 31 days after his inauguration due to pneumonia in the right lung. Vice president John Tyler has succeeded Harrison, though this has been slightly contentious due to Harrison being the first president to die in office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZACHDEATH;President Zachary Taylor has suddenly died of a stomach disease. Taylor was born on a Virginia plantation in 1784 but soon moved to a small woodland cabin in Kentucky. He joined the military in 1808 and served as an officer in the War of 1812, the Black Hawk War and the Second Seminole War. He then played a crucial role in the Mexican-American War, leading the army to victory in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, Monterrey and Buena Vista despite being outnumbered. This won him immense popularity among the American people, being compared to George Washington and Andrew Jackson, previous presidents with military backgrounds. He ran as the Whig candidate in the presidential election of 1848, facing off against the Democratic candidate Lewis Cass who lost votes to former president Martin Van Buren who ran under the Free Soil Party. Taylor suddenly contracted a severe case of cholera morbus and perished within 5 days of falling ill, leading some to suspect foul play. He has been succeeded by vice president Millard Fillmore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAYDEMONSTRATION;The national Constituent Assembly recently elected a new government, the so-called executive committee of the French Republic. It is largely composed of moderate Republicans who oppose the radical policies of the former provisional government. To insulate itself from the inevitable popular pressure of Paris, the government has, in an act seen by many as undemocratic, banned political parties and special-interest groups from sending delegations to read petitions to the Assembly, a practice from the 1789 revolution. Additionally, the meek foreign policy of non-interference in any other European revolution has drawn criticism. Parisian militants, mostly radicals, held a demonstration in support of the oppressed Poles. They headed for the Palais Bourbon, where the Assembly was meeting, and forced their way into the chamber, leading the Assembly to dissolve. The crowd then marched to the City Hall of Paris, where it proclaimed a radical insurrectionary government. The city hall was then besieged by the national guard, dislodging the protesters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00090;The Peace of Montpellier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00090;Despite the best efforts of the international community, the superiority of Franco-Spanish arms on the field has been proven definitively over those of the powers arrayed against the Bourbon Empire. As the guns fall silent, Europe has been forced to acknowledge the existence of the rising power in the west, and to recognize the union between France and Spain as legitimate, undoing the treaty of Utrecht once and for all. While this, at least for the time being, ends the external threat to the existence of the monarchy, there yet remains many internal challenges for the Empire to sort out if it seeks to take its place in the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00090;A new sun rises over Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00079;The Coronation of the Bourbon Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00079;A strange tide befalls the peoples of western Europe, as, almost anachronistically, a personal union has come to radically upend the balance of power. In the midst of the liberal revolutions, the rise of nationalism and nation-states, and an era where the Ancien Regime was thought to have died with the advent of modern liberalism, it is the forces of traditionalism, of dynastic politics stretching back centuries, that have found themselves in this prime position. The Bourbon King of France and the Carlist king of Spain are now one and the same, uniting the two realms into a single state. This coronation vindicates the eternal beliefs of the traditionalist nobility and upper society, but raises the ire of not only liberals and nationalists. It falls in brazen violation of the Treaty of Utrecht, which forbids the union of the lines of France and Spain. This action poses an existential threat to the balance of power in Europe, and undoubtedly there will be a vitriolic response from the international community. The coming years will be ones of turbulence unmatched since the days of Napoleon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00079;We will endure the tide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00094;The Language Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00094;With the unification of the two joint realms of France and Spain and the quiet of peace comes the first major crisis of the union, that being the issue of language. While the two realms have often been very close diplomatically, culturally they are very far apart, and linguistically even more so. While a simple solution would be to remain bilingual, that would clearly come at great cost to the organization and structure of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00094;The king is Spanish, so too should the realm be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00095;A Leftist Spring;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00095;The dualist character of the Bourbon realm has caused a great upset in both the French and Spanish sections of the empire a great upset, as both parties considered themselves rightfully the leaders of the union, and much expected the Bourbon realm to merely be an extension of their own. With this, the idea of the Ancien Regime itself being a foreign concept, an occupation by elites of a royalist character, has become increasingly prominent in social circles. Radicals have gained much by capitalizing on this resentment, promoting a separation of the two artificially fused realms. While staunch monarchists remain loyal, violence is doubtlessly soon to commence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00095;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00098;The Spanish Republican Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00098;While the Bourbon Realm unified the two lines of the French and Spanish Bourbons, it did not resolve the unfortunate political disputes in Spain proper between the Carlists, the very same line on the throne of the Bourbon empire, and the liberal Christinos. Whereas in recent years the latter have increasingly moved their support away from royal squabbles and into the realm of liberal revolution, the divide continues to exist within our empire. With the character of our monarchy taking one distinctly separate from that of a Spanish nationality, the liberals and radicals in Spain have mounted a resistance to our rule, and undoubtedly will soon strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00098;These fools again? We already won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00100;The French National Front;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00100;Despite the best efforts of the Bourbon monarchy to keep the French people in line, fears of foreign domination have come to dominate French society, and deep-seeded republican sentiments have taken the union as a great source of propaganda, showing off the Spanish character of the monarchs and the seeming preference for Spanish ways of life over those of France as a clear indication that the French people are under threat of being oppressed by a foreign monarch, and by a people historically subservient to their interests, no less. These radicals have come to form the French National Front, a paramilitary organization dedicated to 'liberating' the French people from the Bourbon monarchy, and to establish a true nationalist republic in their wake. This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, the duchy of Tuscany was restored, with the exception of Lucca being handed back to the Bourbon-Parmas until such time as Parma was once again inherited to them. While Parma has been restored to the line, there is a unique opportunity to protest the annexation of Lucca back into Tuscany, using this to justify a restoration of Etruria under the Bourbon line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00052;Henri V, king of France, graced by God, has now passed. With him, the legitimate successors to the Bourbon line of Louis XIV has fully died out, and a new king must be selected. Some Legitimistes remain advocates of the absolutist line of the Bourbons, and have thus moved up the line to the Spanish Bourbons, otherwise known as the Carlist claimants to Spain. This is wildly unpopular, even among many monarchists, as this line is blatantly Spanish, and thus foreign to the French people, but selecting it opens the possibility of a power far outstripping that of most European powers, by uniting the Spanish and French thrones into one. Conversely, many Legitimistes have merged with the old Orleaniste movement, backing Philippe II, and thus adopting a more moderate, constitutionalist position. The choice remains ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00054;On this day, Charles XI, king of France and the rightful heir to the Spanish throne, has died. He shall be followed by Jaime I.

Nonetheless, he shall be followed by Jaime, who inherits both the duchy of Madrid and the kingdom of Spain, to be titled Jaime III.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A continuation of the Spanish line of Bourbons, it is feared that in the coming era this will hallmark a period of great instability for the French crown, though it remains to be seen whether these fears will come to pass or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00067;Recognition of the Polish Partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00067;With the rule of the Bourbon monarchy in Paris finding a distinct need to regain some measure of international legitimacy in the wake of the catastrophe that was the Napoleonic wars, the decision has been made to eject any pretenses of Polish recognition, at least in official circles, from French government. As such, any Polish committees will be banned from Paris and the kingdom as a whole, maps will be forbidden from including the Polish state on the map so long as it remains partitioned, and overtures will assure that France will never support any attempt at Polish reunification. This will undoubtedly drive a permanent wedge between the French and the Polish, but ultimately it is a sacrifice that must be made in order to cool down the tense relations France unfortunately has had to endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As it stands, the realm of Two Sicilies has a close relationship with the monarchy, and much like our own realm, struggles to maintain its status in the face of the rising tide of liberalism.

EVTDESC00012;In the aftermath of the July Revolution, the French Bourbons have seemingly found themselves a haven in the reactionary state of the Kingdom of Spain, led by the deeply traditionalist king Carlos V. This friendly regime directly across the border has proven to be problematic to the legitimacy of the Orleanist monarchial line and its more liberal support base by potentially granting Legitimistes a base of operations directly across the border from France. This has become an embarrassment for the crown and for the revolution, and something must be done about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME00013;The July Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00013;In the aftermath of the July Revolution in France, the deposed rightful royal king of France, and his supporters, have found Spain to be a safe haven from the ravenous liberals across the border. Now, the Orleaniste usurpers in Paris have demanded that the French Bourbons, relative to our own king and nobility, be expatriated elsewhere just so they may have more security. While this demand is outrageous at the face of it, it has been strongly implied that France may consider force of arms if we do not oblige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00013;We will not violate our sovereignty for liberal prattle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00013;We shall concede to their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC00014;The crown in Spain has refused our generous demands, and has reaffirmed that it is well within its territorial sovereignty to keep the Bourbon monarchs within their borders, despite our protest. We have little recourse in this matter, save force of arms, or dropping the matter entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00014;Are the Bourbons worth that much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB00014;They will be expatriated, one way or another.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME00015;Spain concedes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC00015;The crown in Spain has made a wise choice and backed down on this matter. Political security has been secured, and the French Bourbons have been forced to move elsewhere, hopefully somewhere further away from the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA00015;I wonder if we can make them expatriate their own Bourbons too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

marotist_reforms_d_desc;Following the controversy surrounding Maroto regarding suspected Christino loyalties, he was pardoned by the king when the charges proved false. With his status as a primary leader of the Carlist cause restored, it has been suggested that the army adopt several reforms that he himself has pushed forth to modernize the Spanish army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
add_carlist_distributism_title;Carlist Distributism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
add_carlist_distributism_desc;Upon the advent of socialism, the Catholic church felt compelled to make a response to the unrest the socialist movement created amongst the poor strata of society, as the Church historically held a highly conservative standpoint and felt that socialist and liberal political activism threatened to upend traditional moral and moral structures, as well as erode Catholic church authority, which had already been declining for some time. The Papal response therefore was to seek the advent of a 'third way' ideology, one that would come to be known as distributism. Characterized by clerical authority, land reform, agrarianism, and extensive preference to small business enterprise over corporations, the ideology would quickly gain traction as the primary economic policy of the Carlist movement. Passing this reform will therefore greatly strengthen resource output and education at the expense of heavy industrial efficieny, and the redistribution of land will undoubtedly come at great cost to the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

constitution_of_juan_iii_title;The Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
constitution_of_juan_iii_desc;Since the succession of Carlos V to the throne of Spain, the issue of a Spanish constitution has been put on hold, due to the deeply traditionalist mindset of the Carlist support base, and fears that caving to liberal ideals would erode the authority of the church and of the Fueros system. With a more liberally-minded monarch in charge, perhaps a middle ground can be met, with the creation of a proper national legislature. The result is the Turnismo system, wherein the legislature is organized under a bicameral system between traditionalists and liberals, members of which are carefully selected before elections begin, and are purposefully rotated in order to ensure neither party maintains absolute control over the Spanish government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

spa_accept_minorities_desc;After many years of reforms, liberalization and gradual progress, Spain has become a more tolerant and open-minded country. The Basques, Galicians, Catalans and other small minorities have long faced linguistic, cultural and societal persecution, assimilation and discrimination by the Castilian Spanish administrations in Madrid. Now, the time has finally come to accept these minorities as they are: As much a part of Spain as all other Spaniards, no matter their heritage. Through the introduction of a federal system, we can ensure the partial autonomy of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia on the same level as every other Spanish province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ENGATTACKSKALAT;Britain has sent an envoy bearing a message of great peril to Mir Mehrab Khan Baloch II. The United Kingdom demands free passage through our territories for its armies on their way to Afghanistan through the Bolan Pass. Should we refuse this demand, rumor has it that the Brits will invade to install a pretender to the throne, the young Mir Shah Nawaz Khan Baloch, who would act as a puppet to London. On the other hand, if we allow Britain to send an army through our lands unimpeded, it will signal our weakness and their dominance, certainly causing outrage among our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PREGOLDSMID;Kohan Dil Khan, the ruler of the Principality of Kandahar, a vassal state of Afghanistan, has died, sparking a succession crisis between a pretender by the name of Rahim Dil Khan, and the sons of Kohan Dil. Dost Mohammad Khan, Emir of Afghanistan, has capitalized off of this period of anarchy and invaded Kandahar with the goal of integrating it into Afghanistan proper. One of the pretenders to the throne of Kandahar has called on the Persians to intervene on his behalf, giving Naser al-Din Shah Qajar a pretext to invade the region in opposition to the Afghan conquest. This poses a direct threat to Afghan bufferdom to India, as the city of Kandahar is not far from the strategically vital Bolan Pass. Advisors suggest that we propose a diplomatic solution to the Shah -- one that would not only settle the border of Afghanistan and Persia, but also permanently establish buffer states in Baluchistan. §RThis will give away land owned in Baluchistan.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAZADORSINKS;Horrible news has reached us from the South: A steamship of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Navy, the 'Cazador', has sunk after running aground on the rocks of Punta Carranza, a cape near the city of Constitución. The ship was serving as a transport for soldiers, resulting in over 450 deaths. Only 43 people managed to escape the stricken ship and reach the safety of land. Among the survivors is the captain, Ramón Cabieses Alzamora, who is due to be court-martialed in the city of Valparaíso.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME128100;The First Ascent of the Wetterhorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT128100DESC;Together with Melchior Bannholzer and Hans Jaun from the nearby town of Grindelwald, Alfred Wills, a barrister from the United Kingdom, has completed the first ascent of the Wetterhorn -- or so he thinks. Little does he know that, about a decade earlier, the 'The Peak of Tempests', sitting at 3692 meters above the Mediterranean, was already summitted by two guides, Melchior Bannholzer and Hans Jaun, from the nearby town of Grindelwald. The two later participated in a further expedition joined by other guides and even reached the higher neighboring Mittelhorn. Despite Alfred Wills not actually having been been the first to summit the Wetterhorn, his description of the trip in his book 'Wanderings Among the High Alps' is making mountaineering fashionable in Britain in what some have come to call the 'Golden Age of Alpinism'. Many have begun setting their sights on the great mountains of the Alps, beginning a veritable race against time to be the first to summit them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME128101;The First Ascent of the Matterhorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT128101DESC;The picturesque 4478 meter Matterhorn has been summitted by an expedition led by Edward Whymper, a British mountaineer, marking the first ascent of the legendary mountain. On their descent, tragedy struck: Novice mountaineer Douglas Hadow slipped, pulling three expedition members roped to him off a 1200 meter precipice on the mountain's north face. Only three of the original group, including Edward Whymper, survived the fateful accident. They are accused of having cut the rope to ensure that they were not dragged down with the others, though there is no evidence to support this claim. Since the start of the golden age of alpinism in 1854, all the great moutains of the Alps have been conquered, and the Matterhorn was the last, drawing the golden age to a close. Ambitious alpinists have now begun turning their attention to many lesser-known but more technically challenging peaks left unclimbed, causing the dawn of a veritable silver age of mountaineering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME128102;The First Ascent of Dent du Géant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT128102DESC;British mountaineer William W. Graham, motivated by his desire for adventure rather than fame, has ascended the infamously difficult Dent du Géant together with his French guides, Auguste Cupelin and Alphonse Payot. The Dent du Géant or "Giant's Tooth" was previously attempted by famed mountaineer Albert F. Mummery, who was forced back by extremely difficult slabs. This provoked Mummery to exclaim prophetically: 'Absolutely inaccessible by fair means!' The conquest of the Dent du Géant marks the end of the so-called Silver Age of Mountaineering, in which the increasingly challenging remaining peaks left unclimbed during the preceding Golden Age of Mountaineering were defeated. These include the Grepon, the Gletscherhorn, the Grandes Jorasses, the Grünhorn and la Meije. With the Alps virtually exhausted, mountaineers have begun scouting out the Caucasus, the Rocky Mountains, the Andes and even the legendary Himalayas. The end of one era means the dawn of another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CALGENOCIDE;The decline of the native American populations in California, a trend that began under Spanish colonial rule, has rapidly accelerated as the territory has come under the administration of the United States. Over the course of the California gold rush and associated boom from 1846-1873, between 9,492 and 16,094 native Americans were directly killed by settlers while tens of thousands more died of starvation and the squalor of forced labor conditions. At the height of the genocide, the California state government paid out bounties for the killing of native Americans and endorsed a slave trade of captured native American laborers. The federal government contributed to the steep decline of the California native population through several forced removals to reservations. Overall, the native population fell from around 150,000 in 1848 to a mere 16,000 by 1900. Deliberate cultural suppression would continue well into the 21st century through forced assimilation policies such as boarding schools for native children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPEEDRECORD;New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Engine No. 999 is a steam locomotive built in 1893 for the Empire State Express train service. It was a modification of proven earlier designs intended for maximum speed in order to publicize the company and rail line at the 1893 Chicago World Fair. Though official company records indicated an impressive top speed of 82 mph, several enthusiastic onlookers claimed that on May 10th, 1893, the all-black locomotive achieved an unprecedented 112 mph. Though the claim has never been fully verified, if true, No. 999 would have been both the fastest train in the world at the time, and the first to go over 100 mph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OTTONICOLAI;Otto Nicolai was a Prussian composer who gained early prominence with several well received Italian language works. His obvious talent lead to him being recruited to help found the world renowned Vienna Philharmonic in 1842. On 9 March 1849, Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor, Nicolai's first work in German, premiered in the Hofoper Theatre in Berlin. A operatic rendition of Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, it was composed in the singspiel style, a unique German type of performance that alternates between distinct spoken dialogue and musical sections. Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor would go on to be recognized as one of Nicolai's finest compositions and continues to be played on modern stages to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PASTRYDEMANDS;To put the situation plainly, despite the best efforts of our new Republican regime, we have struggled to uphold law and order throughout our vast nation. Yesterday, French prime minister Louis-Mathieu Molé has presented us with the outrageous demand of 600,000 pesos in compensation for the supposed 1832 looting of a pastry shop owned by one Monsieur Remontel, among other claimed grievances against French citizens within our borders. It is becoming increasingly clear that should we refuse these deliberately provocative demands, the French intend to descend upon us like vultures. Regardless of our decision, we must respond at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EUREEXPEDITION;The Kerguelen Islands were discovered and claimed for the French Crown by the French navigator Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec on 12 February 1772. Some of the most isolated landmasses on earth, the sub-Antarctic island chain quickly gained the nickname Îles de la Désolation (Desolation Islands) for their remoteness. Over the years, several nations have chartered expeditions to the islands to investigate their potential as whaling stations. To uphold claims to the territory and associated Antarctic regions, France dispatched the aviso Eure to plant the tricolor in 1893. Avisos were a class of lightly armed vessels designed with speed in mind whose primary purpose was colonial affairs. The Eure expedition was but one of dozens, if not hundreds of such missions carried out by France and other colonial nations to enforce the expansion of their influence and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DORRREBELLION;As late as the 1840s, the state of Rhode Island was still operating under its colonial constitutional charter of 1633. An archaic document, the charter became a major source of discontent as it required being white landowner to vote, disenfranchising an ever-increasing share of the rapidly urbanizing Rhode Island population. From 1841-1842, several major conventions and revolts against the constitution were organized by local politician and activist Thomas Wilson Dorr, including the popular election of a parallel state government to that of the constitutionally elected Governor, Samuel Ward King. Relenting to popular pressure, the state government enacted a new constitution in early 1843 which enfranched most adult male citizens who could pay a one dollar poll tax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MAYERLINGINCIDENT;Emperor, we have received most terrible news. Your beloved son and heir presumptive to the throne, Crown Prince Rudolf, has been found dead at the Imperial Hunting lodge in Mayerling. Next to him was the body of the young baroness Mary Vetsera with whom the Crown Prince has had a longstanding affair. While it seems likely that the illicit lovers carried out a murder-suicide plot, we have already taken precautions to keep this context confidential and out of the public eye.  Archduke Karl Ludwig, next in line to the throne, has already renounced his claim in favor of his son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Liked by both Austrian and Hungarian factions within our empire, Rudolf will be mourned by all. Though the imperial family must too grieve, it would be unwise to ignore the domestic ramifications of Rudolf's passing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
