1925DALIEARTHQUAKE;Today at 2:42 PM, a violent earthquake struck Dali, a city in western Yunnan, the location of its epicenter. The earthquake itself was caused by movement on the northwestern part of the Red River Fault, leaving 76,000 homes destroyed due to the shaking and its resulting fires. The tremors were so severe that it even caused the city walls of Dali to entirely collapse. About 3,600 inhabitants of the city have been tragically killed in the aftermath. We stand united in solidarity as we mourn the many lives lost and support the countless others who now find themselves displaced, injured, or bereft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1934PAHIATUAEARTHQUAKE;Devastating news has reached us from the rural town of Pahiatu. This settlement has been struck by an earthquake of unfathomable force. Many poorly constructed buildings have been severely damaged or collapsed entirely, with reports claiming that two people suffering from bad health died of heart failure. The tremors also caused severe damage in Wairarapa and Hawke's Bay despite their distance from the epicenter. Some say that all of New Zealand was able to feel the shaking. The quake also triggered numerous small landslides, with many cliffs along the coast between Cape Turnagain and Castlepoint collapsing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1934NEPALINDIAEARTHQUAKE;With a death toll estimated at somewhere between 10,700 and 12,000 lives lost, an earthquake has devastated Nepal. Its epicenter was located South of Mount Everest, causing widespread destruction across the region. The towns of Munger and Muzaffarpur have been completely devastated. The impact was felt over vast distances, reaching from Purnea in the East to Champaran in the West and from Kathmandu in the North to Munger in the South. Reports from other regions indicate that the earthquake's effects were even experienced as far away as Lhasa and Bombay, as well as Assam and Punjab.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1933KOSEARTHQUAKE;A powerful earthquake has struck our cherished islands of the tranquil Aegean Sea. The earthquake's epicenter was located just off the shore of the island of Kos, mercilessly shaking the beautiful island. Reports also mention that, in Kos and the surrounding islands, at least 181 lives have been lost as a consequence of the disaster. About 90% of the homes in Kos' central city have been destroyed and the local Church of Agios Nikolaos has been badly damaged. Pyli, a village on the western part of the island, has been heavily damaged. Almost all homes in the town of Antimakheia have been destroyed and the village of Kardamena has been almost completely ruined. On the isle of Nissyros, the villages of Emporio, Pali, Mandraki, and Nikia have also been damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1932IERISSOSEARTHQUAKE;This evening, a devastating earthquake occurred in the environs of Ierissos, a town at the base of the Athos Peninsula. Measuring at a surface magnitude of 7.0, the earthquake destroyed Ierissos in its entirety as well as several surrounding towns, leaving hundreds of people dead and nearly 10,000 homeless. A small tsumani was observed by tidal gauge, but never exceeded a meter in height and thankfully contributed no further damages. Aftershocks would continue into the following year, some exceeding a surface magnitude of 6.0. Between Ierissos and the villages nearby, over four thousand homes would be destroyed in addition to public and commercial buildings. Further to the east, even the sovereign monasteries of holy Mount Athos was not spared harm from the quake, with particular damage befalling those of Stavronikita and Koutloumousiou. In all, it is estimated that material damages incurred from the earthquake amount to roughly five million drachmas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1931NICARAGUAEARTHQUAKE;Disaster has befallen Managua! A bit past ten this Holy Tuesday morning, a horrendously powerful earthquake began in the western parts of Managua, lasting for roughly five seconds and reaching a magnitude of 6.1. The quake's epicenter was located in the cultural and financial center of the city, destroying all government buildings barring the Central Bank as well as nearly all of Managua's archives: Damages were recorded in buildings up to five kilometers away. Yet the earthquake itself was only the beginning of the tragedy - fires from stoves in a destroyed apothecary shop soon spread out of control, laying waste to the largely wooden buildings of the city. The city's unnatural level of crowding due to festivities and preparations for Holy Week only further exacerbated the chaos. The fires for a time burned out of control, with the earthquake earlier preventing the formation of fire brigades: Marines used dynamite in an attempt to demolish structures ahead of the fire, but only contributed to making the flames worse. In the next hour, over a thousand people would perish (with the local penitentary being particuarly stricken), and over 45,000 would be rendered homeless as nearly all of western Managua was destroyed. Tens of millions of dollars in property damages have occurred, and while an outpouring of foreign aid has begun, many see the cataclysm as signs of Managua itself being cursed. A few people have spuriously suggested relocating the Nicaraguan capitol to nearby Granada, which was unaffected by the earthquake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1930SENIGALLIAEARTHQUAKE;Italy just cannot get a reprieve from earthquakes. Just a few months after the quake in Irpinia, a 6.6 magnitude tremor rocked Senigallia, a central Italian city. Thankfully, the foreshocks preceding the main quake gave residents time to flood into the streets, avoiding death from collapsing buildings. This allowed the casualty rate to not exceed 18 lives--14 in Senigallia and 4 in Ancona. However, many families became homeless in the aftermath. Districts of Ancona such as Capodimonte and San Lazzaro were emptied of residents, their people taking refuge in outskirt encampments and by railroads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1917BALIEARTHQUAKE;A significant earthquake struck the island of Bali today at 6:50 AM local time. With a maximum intensity of IX on the Mercalli Scale, the quake triggered many landslides, which contributed to 80% of the 1,500 dead. 2,431 temples are reported to have been destroyed or severely damaged, including the famed Pura Ulun Danu Batur temple in eastern Bali. A small tsunami was triggered and landed on Bali's southeastern coast, but thankfully did no damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1930SALMASEARTHQUAKE;A 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the borderland between southeastern Turkey and northwestern Persia this morning. With an epicenter in the Salmas Plains, the main quake was preceded by a 5.4 magnitude foreshock 15 hours earlier, which significantly damaged local adobe homes. The foreshock would not deter residents from sleeping the night indoors, leading to high casualties when the mainshock struck. 60 villages were completely destroyed. The largest of them, Dilman, suffered such great damage that its inhabitants fled and re-established their homes in a nearby location, naming the new village Salmas. Overall, an estimated 1,360-3,000 people were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1930GARFAGNANAEARTHQUAKE;Earlier this morning, a massive earthquake struck the areas of Garfagnana and Lunigiana in northwestern Tuscany, causing massive damage to life and property. Preceded by a number of foreshocks the prior evening, a main shock of magnitude 6.8 occurred just before 8:00 AM local time with an epicenter directly beneath the town of Villa Collemandina. Between the main quake and aftershocks, Villa Collemandina along with the nearby towns of Vigneta and Fivizzano were completely destroyed: severe damage befell another thirty towns across Garfagnana and Lunigiana, with hundreds of others in a radius surrounding the epicenter reporting collapsed buildings or more minor damages. The earthquake was noticeable from up to 400 kilometers away, and could be felt in parts of Friuli and the the French Riviera. In all, the earthquake would claim 171 lives and cause 650 other casualties, leaving many thousands more homeless: Women and children ranked disproportionately among the dead and wounded on part of the highly agrarian nature of the area, with most farming men out to work in the fields when the main shock arrived. Damage to structures was amplified by the use of poor building materials such as smooth river stones in construction across much of the affected region. Relief has proceeded apace with help from local rescue operations, the military, and emigrant organizations in America and Argentina. Nevertheless, reconstruction is expected to take many years, and property speculation is beginning to run amok in particularly ruined places such as Fivizzano.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1920XALAPAEARTHQUAKE;It's official: the deadliest earthquake in Mexico's history has struck today in Xalapa, Veracruz. The quake, at a 6.3 magnitude, ravaged rural towns across Veracruz and Puebla. Its destruction became exacerbated by resulting landslides and mudflows, which destroyed all buildings in their path. The quake is now being sensationlized by the media, who expand the death toll to several thousand. Some even report sightings of an volcano eruption outside Xalapa. A desperate people have become too frantic to trust common news sources--thus obligating the Geological Institue of Mexico to uncover the truth. From what is being reported by them, it can be concluded that at least 648 deaths resulted from the quake.It's official: the deadliest earthquake in Mexico's history has struck today in Xalapa, Veracruz.

1930BAGOEARTHQUAKE;A terrifying earthquake has taken place, with its epicenter being located roughly 20 kilometers to the North of the city of Bago. Estimates conclude that up to seven thousand people have died, as the shaking has left Bago in ruins, with a fire spreading across the city thereafter, destroying the few buildings that survived. Hundreds of tremors have followed the main earthquake, which resulting in even more casualties. Many pagodas have collapsed or suffered severe damage. A local tsunami with a run-up height of 1 meters has been recorded along the coast, travelling up the Sittaung River and flooding several villages along the way. With a magnitude of 7, the earthquake was felt as far away as Thailand and Shan State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to destruction wrought by the ensuing tsunami, contact with the devastated areas was not possible for the first few days after the disaster. Support only arrived 3 days later by way of ship, as the roads were still destroyed. While only 27 people have died, the magnitude 7 earthquake has caused severe damage, especially to the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland. Additionally, multiple submarine telegraph cables from Europe to the United States have been cut by the submarine landslide that caused the tsunami. The shaking was felt as far away as New York and Montreal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1917GUATEMALAEARTHQUAKE;A series of three major earthquakes has impacted Guatemala City. At every new shock a handful of houses went down. In most of the houses, walls have cracked in two and then roofs have fallen in. In churches, bell towers have crashed down, burying adjacent buildings and their occupants. The tremors were so severe that officials have had to burn about eight thousand dead to prevent pestilence from threatening the city, as they were shaken from their graves in Guatemala City General Cemetery. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless. An estimated 2650 people have perished. It will take years to undo the damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The President of Venezuela, awoken from his sleep by the shaking, fell from a balcony and broke his ankle as the earthquake struck at 4:30 AM. While the earthquake is the strongest to be recorded in Venezuelan records, it has caused less destruction than the one that happened a century ago. The tsunami caused by the earthquake, the epicenter of which was located underwater, also brought havoc to the coast. More than 250 aftershocks are projected to disrupt the people's lives for the next couple of months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has resulted in about a thousand deaths in Shantou alone, with many more occurring across Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei. Shaking was strong enough to cause damage to be felt over a 500,000 square kilometer area, covering 130 counties. In Zhao'an, Fujian Province alone, more than 3,000 homes have collapsed, trapping or killing many residents. The Chao'an District of Chaozhou City in Guangdong Province has seen 20% of all residential buildings completely destroyed and another 40% partially collapsed. Many pagodas, homes and temples in Suzhou, Guangzhou and Nanjing have partially collapsed or sustained significant damaged due to the earthquake.

1849STLOUISFIRE;A fire broke out at St. Louis, Missouri on 17 May 1849 and ravaged most of the city. The steamboats in the Mississippi River and Missouri River could not escape the fate of the city. The city had been facing a population boom: St. Louis is the last major city on the path westward to California and Oregon. The fire struck at night, surprising many inhabitants as they slept. The volunteer fire department tried to extinguish the flames for eight hours, to no avail. To save the city from total destruction, it was decided that buildings facing the fury of flames were to be destroyed with gunpowder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1850KRAKOWFIRE;A devastating fire has struck Kraków. Occurring on the 18 July 1850, it razed 10% of the city to the ground. Kraków being destroyed by fires has hurt the image of Kraków as the center of Polish consciousness and nationalism. Most of city's buildings are old and made of wood, allowing the fire to spread remarkably quickly. The city also has poor water infrastructure and no full-time fire service. The fire could not be halted and lasted several days, damaging numerous historical sites. The fire is believed to have been started by an accident involving a miller and a smith, who, while fixing some equipment, started a fire in a mill building which then spiraled out of control. The fire got worse and worse as the winds carried it to the city center. 153 buildings, two palaces, two or three monasteries, and four churches were destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATNEWCASTLEANDGATESHEADFIRE;The two North East England towns of Newcastle and Gateshead have been ravaged by a disastrous fire that began on the premises of a worsted mill at half past midnight on Friday 6 October 1854. Despite the prompt arrival of several fire engines, within an hour the building was one mass of flame due to the large amounts of oil housed within for the purpose of treating wool. A nearby warehouse storing thousands of tons of sulphur, nitrate of soda, and other combustibles caught fire as the intense heat made the sulphur ignite, melt and stream in a burning blue liquidised state from the windows. Soon, a tremendous explosion occurred that was heard 20 miles away. Its projectile power scattered burning debris widely across Newcastle and Gateshead, a town on the other side of the river Tyne, causing many small fires to erupt that were impossible to control. By the time they were finally put out, 53 people had died, hundreds were injured and hundreds of buildings had been destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATBRISBANEFIRE;News has reached us that a fire has greatly damaged the town of Brisbane, Queensland, sweeping through its center. Even though the fire destroyed many houses and many businesses, there were no human casualties, and only four people were taken to the hospital. The city possesses no fire department, meaning only a few unorganized volunteers arrived at the scene. Due to the heavy use of wood in the city's architecture, the fire progressed rapidly until, after 70 minutes, it slowed to a temporary lull due to some of the brick and stone buildings in the fires path. In all, the flames consumed 50 houses, 2 banks, 3 hotels, 4 draperies, and many other businesses as well as a considerable amount of small houses. Within just a few hours the main center of the city turned to ruin, with the total cost of the fire valued at 60,000 pounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREAT1852FIRE;The city of Montreal is not a stranger to fires, seeing several small blazes in recent years, but nothing could prepare the city for this. The fire began on 8 July and could not be controlled, lasting for several days days as it ferociously tore through the city, leaving ten thousand people homeless and destroying nearly half of the housing in the city. The only way to obtain water is by going to public water pumps, private wells, or to a nearby river or lake. While combating fires, it is incredibly difficult for volunteer firefighters to go from the burning houses, back to the water supply, and back again to the blaze. This took too much time, allowing the fire to rage on. The first fire broke out at a tavern and spread quickly, fanned by strong winds and hot, dry summer weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1866GREATPORTLANDMAINEFIRE;A large fire has affected the city of Portland, Maine. It started in a boat house on Commercial Street, likely caused by a firecracker or cigar ash. The fire spread to a lumber yard and on to a sugar house, then spread across the city, eventually burning out on Munjoy Hill in the city's east end. Two people died in the fire. Ten thousand people were left homeless and close to two thousand buildings burnt to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1886CALGARYFIRE;Calgary was engulfed in flames on November 7, 1886. The fire began at the rear wall of the local flour and feed store, and spread through the community's wooden structures leading to the destruction of 18 buildings. To create a firebreak, an additional fourteen buildings were destroyed or razed, including four stores, three warehouses, three hotels, a tinsmith shop and a saloon. The fire was stopped then extinguished after the break had been created. Authorities suggest arson may be involved, but no arrests were made. Thankfully, no one was killed or injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1888SUNDSVALLFIRE;The city of Sundsvall has been devastated by a swift fire that has left nothing in its path. The blaze began when a spark from a steamboat landed on a brewhouse. Because the city's bells rang to warn people that a fire had broken out, most inhabitants escaped and only four perished. The fire ravaged the city as strong winds to the northwest and the dry hot air spread the flames from one wooden house to the next. 9,000 people have become homeless in just 9 hours. The property damage is estimated at 30 million krona.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GREATBALTIMOREFIRE;Baltimore Fire has the title of being the most destructive fire in the history of the United States after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It started on February 7, 1904, to February 8, destroying most of the city in the process. It would wipe out 1500 buildings off the earth and severely damage another 1000 buildings. The fire lasted for 31 hours and miraculously, no one died in this hellish environment. The city would become better than ever 2 years later, fully restoring everything and turning a disaster into a blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUBLINWHISKEYFIRE;For unknown reasons, Dublin on 18 June 1875, whiskey barrels in a warehouse would explode with heat and unleash a wave of undiluted whiskey to the unsuspecting individuals. This whiskey tsunami would destroy many small houses. Seeing this as an opportunity, various people tried to drink this burning slush and many people died from alcohol poisoning, instead of fire or asphyxiation. In total, 1,193,000 liters would be lost and 13 people would be killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
