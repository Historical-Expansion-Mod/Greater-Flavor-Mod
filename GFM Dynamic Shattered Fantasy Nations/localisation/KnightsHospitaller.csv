kni_pap_reconcile_desc;After Malta was captured in 1798, the knights were dispersed across Europe. After failing to find a home elsewhere across Italy, the Order moved permanently to Rome in 1834.

kni_rus_reconcile_title;Reconcile with Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_rus_reconcile_desc;After the fall of Malta in 1798, the Russian Emperor Paul I graciously gave a large number of knights shelter in Saint Petersburg.

kni_rus_reconcile_event_desc;An offer from the Knights of Malta. After the fall of Malta in 1798, the Russian Emperor Paul I graciously gave a large number of knights (and some priceless artefacts) shelter in Saint Petersburg. Now, with the Knights Hospitaller regaining sovereignty in Malta, they are asking for the treasure back, and for the rejoining of their refugee comrades back to Malta. This will cost us nothing, but we could humiliate them by refusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mlt_become_kni_desc;Whatever Malta represented hasn't worked out for us. We've become weak and insecure. It's time to restore our rightful place and readopt the Knights Hospitaller into all levels of government. Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_become_theocracy_title;Be a theocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kni_become_theocracy_desc;If you're seeing this decision, you've probably had to play as the UK, then release and play as the Knights.

kni_claim_rhodes_title;Claim Rhodes;;;;;;;;;;;;;

kni_buy_croix_desc;In 1665, the Knight Hospitaller lost its Caribbean holdings.
