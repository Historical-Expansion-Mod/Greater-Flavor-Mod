fish_trawlers;Fishing Trawlers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fish_trawlers_desc;The modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

pattinson_process;Pattinson's Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pattinson_process_desc;Pattinson's Process is a method for removing silver from lead. The process is dependent on the fact that lead which has least silver in it solidifies first on liquefaction. In practice several crystallisations were required and the silver content of the silver-rich melt could not be raised above 2%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
parkes_process;Parkes Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;
parkes_process_desc;The Parkes process is a pyrometallurgical process for removing silver from lead during the production of bullion. The process takes advantage of two liquid-state properties of zinc. The first is that zinc is immiscible with lead, and the other is that silver is 3000 times more soluble in zinc than it is in lead. When zinc is added to liquid lead that contains silver as a contaminant, the silver preferentially migrates into the zinc. Because the zinc is immiscible in the lead it remains in a separate layer and is easily removed. The zinc-silver solution is then heated until the zinc vaporizes, leaving nearly pure silver. If gold is present in the liquid lead, it can also be removed and isolated by the same process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
square_set_timbering;Square-set Timbering;;;;;;;;;;;;;
square_set_timbering_desc;Square-set timbering is a system invented by a German named Philip Deidesheimer that uses heavy timber "cubes" as supports for underground mining tunnels and shafts, that enabled skilled miners to open three-dimensional cavities of any size. In large openings, the cubes can be filled with waste rock, creating a solid pillar of wood and rock from floor to roof ("back" in miner's terminology). The system, which was inspired by the structure of honeycombs, enabled mining of the large silver orebodies of the Comstock Lode, which were in very weak rock—in miner's terms, "heavy ground". Deidesheimer refused to patent the innovation, which was easily the most important mining innovation of 1860.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dynamite;Dynamite;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dynamite_desc;Dynamite is an explosive made of nitroglycerin, sorbents (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the Swedish chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel in Geesthacht, and patented in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a more powerful alternative to black powder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
electrolytic_refining;Electrolytic Refining;;;;;;;;;;;;;
electrolytic_refining_desc;Electrolysis, or electrolytic refining, is a technique used for extraction, as well as purification, of metals obtained by any refining method. In the electro-refining process, a block of impure metal becomes the anode, and a thin sheet of metal becomes the cathode. Both the cathode and anode are dipped in an electrolytic cell containing an aqueous solution of the metal salt. Upon the application of electric current of a suitable voltage, pure metal is deposited at the cathode by the dissolution of impure metal at the anode.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deep_mining;Deep Coal Mining;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deep_mining_desc;Deep mining means the extraction of coal through underground mining methods, including gaining access to the coal deposits by means of vertical or inclined shafts, by drift mining from the coal outcrop, or by other means that do not involve the stripping away of overburden to expose the deposit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
percussion_drill;Pneumatic Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;;
percussion_drill_desc;In Europe since the late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the excavation of a 12-kilometer (7.5 mi) tunnel through Mount Fréjus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm. The need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and this sparked research on pneumatic rock drills in Europe. A Frenchman, Cavé, designed, and in 1851 patented, a rock drill that used compressed air, but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, so it was not successful. In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a rock drill whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mount Fréjus tunnel project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
friction_hoist;Friction Hoist;;;;;;;;;;;;;
friction_hoist_desc;Invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe, friction (or Koepe_ hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. They utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lixiviation_mills;Lixiviation Milling;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lixiviation_mills_desc;Lixiviation milling, also known as Heap leaching, is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cyanide_milling;Cyanide Milling;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cyanide_milling_desc;The cyanide process (also known as the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinitrotoluene;Trinitrotoluene;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trinitrotoluene_desc;Trinitrotoluene, or TNT, was first prepared in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and originally used as a yellow dye. Its potential as an explosive was not recognized for several years, mainly because it was so difficult to detonate and because it was less powerful than alternatives. Its explosive properties were first discovered by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann, in 1891. TNT is one of the most commonly used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shrinkage_stoping;Shrinkage Stoping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shrinkage_stoping_desc;Shrinkage stoping is a mining method used for steeply dipping, narrower ore bodies with self supporting walls and ore. It is an overhand mining method that relies on broken ore being left in the stope to be used as the “working floor” and to support the walls. During the mining cycle, only 30 – 35% of the ore blasted is extracted being equivalent to the swell factor of in-situ ore to broken. When mining is complete to the next upper horizon, the ore is extracted. Although it is not necessary to fill the resulting voids, they are commonly filled with waste rock from development. Level intervals seldom exceed 40 meters due to uneven muck draw. Recoverable pillars are left at each level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
froth_flotation;Froth Flotation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
froth_flotation_desc;Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as "the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of sulfide ores".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
hydraulic_excavator;Hydraulic Excavator;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ductile_iron_desc;The very first excavator to use hydraulic technology was built in 1882 by Sir W. G. Armstrong & Company in England, where it was used in construction of the Hull docks. Unlike later excavators that use hydraulic fluid, water was used to operate the hydraulic functions. Also, it was not a true hydraulic machine, but a hybrid that used cables to operate the bucket but with a hydraulic cylinder operating a set of multiplying sheaves. The idea was not successful, neither on this machine nor on a machine of somewhat similar design built by the unrelated Frank F. Armstrong for Penn Iron Mining Company in the United States in 1914.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
entralized_economic_planning;Centralized Economic Planning;;;;;;;;;;;;;
centralized_economic_planning_desc;As more radical ideological alternatives to liberal democracy gained power in the early twentieth century, the opportunity to reconstruct economic organization based on State direction of economic activity that could be compared to the relative success or failure of traditional market-based economic structures arose. Such programs of centralized economic planning, employed by both communist and fascist regimes, often achieved dramatic initial results in reducing unemployment, increasing output of industrial goods, and removing the problem of conflict between laborer and employer in society, which the regimes would trumpet as proof of the superiority of their systems over free market systems. The social and economic costs to these societies, however, were often very high, and the resistance to State control created the potential for brutal repression. However, to the outside world that knew little of the negative consequences of these plans, they seemed to suggest a viable alternative to the free-market systems that had been the hallmark of nineteenth century economic theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bolt_action_rifle_armament;Bolt-action Rifle Armament;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bolt_action_rifle_armament_desc;Bolt action is a type of firearm action in which the weapon's bolt is operated manually by the opening and closing of the breech (barrel) with a small handle. The first bolt-action rifle was produced in 1824 by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse, following work on breechloading rifles. European armies continued to develop bolt-action rifles through the latter half of the Nineteenth Century and World War I marked the height of the bolt-action rifle's use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
existentialism;Existentialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
existentialism_desc;Existentialism has many mothers. In one way it could be interpreted as a radical individualism traced from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, but it is more. It is also the notion of the given as not really given but only meaningful through the process of interpretation, something that it got from Husserl, and more indirectly from Bretano. However it was taken further by Heidegger and later Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, and became focused on what gives meaning to the person, where the person should be understood as a being that is free to take action and thus create their own meaning rather than the more inflexible, outdated cartesian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
polyphase_system;Polyphase System;;;;;;;;;;;;;
polyphase_system_desc;The polyphase system is a way to help transmit alternating current efficiently. In it two or more phases travel simultaneously. In industrial applications three waves is the standard, although at first two phases were used. The invention of the polyphase system by Nikola Tesla meant the final loss for Thomas Alva Edison and his direct current.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
young_school_doctrine;Young School Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
young_school_doctrine_desc;The Jeune École ("Young School") is a strategic naval concept developed that advocates the use of small, powerfully equipped units to combat a larger battleship fleet, and commerce raiders capable of ending the trade of the rival nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fleet_in_being_doctrine;Fleet-in-Being Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fleet_in_being_doctrine_desc;The "fleet in being" concept is based on the assumption that the fleet is relatively safe in port, even if near the enemy. Keeping the "fleet in being", one could maintain an active threat which would force the enemy to remain in the area and prevent them from taking the initiative elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sea_power_doctrine;Sea Power Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sea_power_doctrine_desc;Sea power is the means by which a nation extends its military power onto the seas. Measured in terms of a nation’s capacity to use the seas in defiance of rivals and competitors, it consists of such diverse elements as combat craft and weapons, auxiliary craft, commercial shipping, bases, and trained personnel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

genetics_heredity_desc;Heredity Genetics were a major step towards the understanding of life itself. Gregor Mendel (1822-84) assumed that every trait an organism contains is written down in some material factors and are transferred during the process of reproduction. In experiments with his pea plants he could prove his thesis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

schrapnel_standard_design;Schrapnel Standard Design;;;;;;;;;;;;;
schrapnel_standard_design_desc;Shrapnel shells were anti-personnel artillery munitions which carried a large number of individual bullets close to the target and then ejected them to allow them to continue along the shell's trajectory and strike the target individually. They relied almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality. The final shrapnel shell design bore little similarity to Henry Shrapnel's original design, marking the quick evolution of technology at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
barbed_wire_defense;Barbed Wire Defense;;;;;;;;;;;;;
barbed_wire_defense_desc;Barbed wire is a type of steel fencing wire constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strand. It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls or as a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare, stopping infantry charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
helmet_mass_production;Helmet Mass Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;
helmet_mass_production_desc;The use of artillery and modern machine guns renewed the need for steel helmets. They quickly became  the standard among armed forces, from the French Adrian and the British Brodie to the German Stahlhelm. By the 20th century, such helmets offered protection for the head from shrapnel and fragments as well as for specialist roles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
camouflage_uniforms;Camouflage Uniforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
camouflage_uniforms_desc;Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making the target hard to see, or by disguising them as something else. With the raise in mortality of modern warfare, it seemed prudent to make our soldiers harder to kill by replacing the traditional uniforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rotary_kiln;Rotary Kiln;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rotary_kiln_desc;The Rotary "endless" kiln gives perfect control over combustion and produces a better grade of cement. The kiln is a cylindrical vessel, inclined slightly to the horizontal, which is rotated slowly about its axis. The material to be processed is fed into the upper end of the cylinder. As the kiln rotates, material gradually moves down towards the lower end, and may undergo a certain amount of stirring and mixing. Hot gases pass along the kiln, sometimes in the same direction as the process material, but usually in the opposite direction. The hot gases may be generated in an external furnace, or may be generated by a flame inside the kiln.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
stiff_plastic_brickmaking_machine;Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
stiff_plastic_brickmaking_machine_desc;In the machines used in the stiff-plastic process the previously powdered and screened clay is mixed into a stiff-plastic, granular material, which is afterwards compressed into a stiff paste. The mixing may be made in a trough-mixer or in a pug-mill. The shaping of bricks by the stiff-plastic process take places in two parts: the clot or roughly shaped brick which is made by mechanically forcing the stiff paste into a mould and the brick which is made by pressing the clot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pasteurization;Pasteurization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
pasteurization_desc;Named after the French microbiologist Louis Pasteur, Pasteurization is a process of food preservation in which packaged and non-packaged foods are treated with mild heat to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life. This is especially useful for syrups, beer, wine, vinegar, canned foods, juices, milk, eggs, and other produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
maple_syrup_evaporator;Maple Syrup Evaporator;;;;;;;;;;;;;
maple_syrup_evaporator_desc;Maple syrup, derived from the sap of maple trees, is processed by boiling and evaporating the sap to remove excess water and concentrate the sugar within. To this end, the newly patented maple syrup evaporators efficiently heat and concentrate sap using large, flat sheet metal pans that are more efficient than traditional  heavy, rounded iron kettles due to having a larger surface area that is condusive to evaporation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

dobby_loom;Dobby Loom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dobby_loom_desc;A Dobby loom is a type of floor loom that controls all the warp threads using a device called a dobby. The main advantage of dobby looms is that more intricate designs can be produced. Dobby looms can be operated by wooden lags with pegs, which rotate around a roller above the loom. The pegs in the lags correspond to the lifting plan, which controls which harnesses are lifted. Punched paper pattern cards can also be used.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cotton_gin;Cotton Gin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cotton_gin_desc;The Cotton Gin is a machine for cleaning cotton of its seeds. The device pulls the cotton through a set of wire teeth mounted on a revolving cylinder, the fibre passing through narrow slots in an iron breastwork too small to permit passage of the seed. The simplicity of the invention — which could be powered by man, animal, or water — caused it to be widely copied despite patents. The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50. While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lancashire_loom;Lancashire Loom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lancashire_loom_desc; The Lancashire Loom is an self-acting loom, though it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. The principal advantage of the Lancashire loom was that it was semi-automatic, when a warp thread broke the weaver was notified. When the shuttle ran out of thread, the machine stopped. An operative thus could work 4 or more looms whereas previously they could only work a single loom. Indeed the term A Four Loom Weaver was used to describe the operatives. Labour cost was quartered. In some mills an operative would operate 6 or even 8 looms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_powered_silk_reels;Steam-Powered Silk-Reels;;;;;;;;;;;;;
steam_powered_silk_reels_desc;Silk reeling is the process by which a number of cocoon baves are reeled together to produce a single thread. This is achieved by unwinding filaments collectively from a group of cooked cocoons at one end in a warm water bath and winding the resultant thread onto a fast moving reel. By mechanizing the process, we could increase our silk-reeling efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
