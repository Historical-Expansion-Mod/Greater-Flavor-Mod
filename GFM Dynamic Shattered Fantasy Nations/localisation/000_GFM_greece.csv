EVTNAME5000001;Greek Revolutionaries make their Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000001;Ioannis Makrygiannis, the leader of the revolution of 1821 against the Ottomans, has begun to organise various rebel bands against our absolutist rule, declaring King Otto, our Bavarian monarch just as bad as the sultan in Constantinople. However, while the situation is rapidly deteriorating, it hasn't spiralled out of control just yet. Rejecting his demands might see the country erupt into all-out revolt. It all depends on our response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTA;We cannot risk rebellion, capitulate to his demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTB;His terms are outrageous and compromising, declare him an outlaw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTC;Make token conncessions that will surely starve out his movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME5000002;Constitutional Rebels Mobilize;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000002;Ioannis Makrygiannis and his rebels have had enough of the reactionary nature of King Otto and his Bavarian bureaucracy, his armies have begun to march towards $CAPITAL$. Hour by hour more parts of our army and peasantry are joining him and it seems that the situation is now completely untenable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000002OPTA;Call all those still loyal to defend his highness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME5000003;Revolutionary armies surround Royal Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000003;Despite our best attempts at dispersing rebel activity in recent years, it has all come to nought as rebel armies surround the old royal palace and demand that the king immediately be overthrown and a constituion be put in his place with universal suffrage for all Greek Men. We may however still have a chance if we rapidly call on anyone still loyal to the king, but, fighting these changes will cost our country dearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000003OPTA;We must accept our defeat, the rebels have won this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000003OPTB;No concessions, tell Steinstorf to rally anyone still loyal and fire at will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME5000004;George I Assassinated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000004;News has reached us that King of the Hellenes George I was assassinated by self-proclaimed socialist Alexandros Schinas after the king supposedly refused to give him money. He was killed instantly as the bullet struck his heart. George's body is to be returned to $CAPITAL$ and laid in state in the Metropolitan Cathedral for 3 days before being buried in a tomb at his palace in Tatoi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_balkan_federation_title;Form A Balkan Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_balkan_federation_desc;§RGain 10 infamy§! The political movement of a united Balkan identity has recently seen a surge of support due to the creation of a Democratic Oriental Federation, founded by a number of Balkan intellectuals. If we manage to extend our influence to the rest of our Balkan brethren, we could use this opportunity to strive for a greater Balkan future. We must seize this opportunity in order to strengthen our grip on Europe, and to stand united against any who wish to sow strife between our great cultures. United we stand, divided we fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_thrace_bfr_desc;§RGain 2.5 infamy§! Thrace is geographically part of the Balkans, and to secure our hold as a Balkan union state, we must fully secure the Balkan peninsula. Not only is Thrace a natural border between us and Turkish Anatolia to the east, but Istanbul is also an incredibly valuable and important city. Whoever controls it, controls trade in the Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_hungary_bfr_desc;§RGain 10 infamy§! The historically Hungarian heartlands of Transdanubia and Central Hungary are geographically important to us. Previously part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, we may now seek to claim their lands as our own. However the Hungarians themselves may feel as if we're taking away their choice of self-governance, and may never accept a Hungarian future in a Balkan state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
